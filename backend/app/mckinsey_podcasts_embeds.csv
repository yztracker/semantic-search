But barriers to widespread adoption remain. Here’s what companies must do to topple them.', 'While the internal-combustion engine dominates car design, its existence contributes to global warming and detracts from electric-vehicle (EV) development. Things like carbon emissions, the complexity of design, and battery development are slowing down the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But they don’t have to. Russell Hensley, co-leader of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility in the Americas, joins McKinsey editorial director Roberta Fusaro to discuss what can be done to encourage manufacturers to produce and consumers to embrace electric cars.', 'After, hear Alan Murray, CEO of Fortune Media, talk about his search for the soul of American business in an excerpt from our Author Talks series featuring his book, Tomorrow’s Capitalist (Hachette Book Group, May 2022).', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: We’ve all heard how the electric vehicle is coming. But so far, the adoption has been relatively slow. What’s keeping suppliers from producing more electric vehicles?', 'Russell Hensley: That’s a multibillion-dollar question. We are certainly in the decade of the EV. But the vast majority of vehicles on the road today are powered by internal-combustion engines. And one side effect is the emissions of carbon. It’s quite complex to actually design, develop, and produce electric vehicles at scale when you have a vehicle fleet so dominated by the internal-combustion engine, and all the systems in the world for mobility have been indexed toward the internal-combustion engine.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are some of those complexities?', 'Russell Hensley: There are several forces at work in the EV industry: regulation, economics, technology, and the consumer, who has to appreciate and adopt the new technology. If it wasn’t for the regulators, we probably wouldn’t be talking about electric vehicles today. We’ve got regulation that promotes the adoption of electric vehicles.', 'Second, the technology: over the past 20 years, we’ve seen the rapid adoption of mobile electronics and, with that, the development of batteries and energy storage. That application has paved the way for huge advances in energy storage and batteries that are suitable for applications in vehicles.', 'We’ve got a combination of regulations aiming to reduce carbon, electric vehicles being part of the solution, and batteries being a critical element of the electric vehicle.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What’s keeping consumers from driving EVs?', 'Russell Hensley: Adoption has not gone faster because there is a hesitation in pivoting from something that is so trustworthy in the internal-combustion engine to something that is a relatively new technology. And, with vehicles being the second-largest investment that a household makes, it’s obviously a decision that takes much consideration.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How popular is EV adoption globally? What are the data around EV adoption across the globe?', 'Russell Hensley: If you take the global lens, electric-vehicle adoption differs quite significantly by region. Europe and China have similar adoption rates as a percent of volume, running somewhere close to 20 to 25 percent of new vehicles sold. But then, in the US, we have tended to be slower in terms of adoption, with something like 5 to 7 percent of new vehicle sales being electric in the US. There are a number of reasons why that is the case. If you look at the makeup of new vehicles sold in the US, a large proportion of them are actually pickup trucks and SUVs.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How is the industry focusing on electrifying trucks and SUVs—since the demand is there?', 'Russell Hensley: It’s somewhat easier to make the physics work and the economics to box with a smaller vehicle, which requires a smaller battery and has different demands based on the use cases than, say, for a pickup truck. That is changing quite quickly.', 'We are beginning to see the first introductions of electric SUVs and pickup trucks and will certainly see more in the next 12 to 18 months from the Detroit Three. These types of trucks will begin to accelerate adoption, if consumers and business owners adopt them.', 'Toward the end of the decade, about half of the new vehicles sold in the US, typically around 17 million units a year, will likely be powered by an electric motor and battery. Therefore, we will be catching up with the other regions around the world. We may lag at this point, but it’s going to change once you get the electrification of the more popular models in the US.', 'Toward the end of the decade, about half of the new vehicles sold in the US … will likely be powered by an electric motor and battery.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Batteries seem to be the core challenge and also the core opportunity. Why is it so hard for manufacturers and producers to source the raw materials, or generate the batteries as quickly as we need to?', 'Russell Hensley: You have to have the production facilities to build not only the vehicles, but also the batteries that go into the vehicles. And that’s where battery gigafactories come into play. Gigafactories, by default, will have a tremendous appetite for raw materials. Those raw materials often come from challenging places in the world. That has to be addressed either through links within the ecosystem between the industry and mines, or a very creative way of recycling the materials that exist in vehicles on the road.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are the challenges related to battery application in EVs?', 'Russell Hensley: The challenge when you put batteries into the automotive application is the magnitude of the battery. It’s a large energy storage device that will go through multiple cycles in its life, and it contains precious metals.', 'But it means ensuring that the chemistry is stable and ensuring that the battery can go through the multiple cycles of charging and discharging over the life of a vehicle. A typical vehicle will last 16 to 17 years in the US, so it’s a tall order.', 'We’re still in our infancy. That said, the 2020s will be the decade of the EV, and we will see this adoption go from 5 percent to 50 percent of new-vehicle sales, and gradually penetrate the fleet as the economics become more competitive and the model availability expands.', 'With the popularity and the increase in demand for electric vehicles, so goes the demand for the raw materials that go into the battery, which creates another challenge. Some of these materials are quite costly and are only found in certain parts of the world, which makes it quite challenging for the US to ensure energy independence.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What can you tell us about the cost of these EV batteries?', 'Russell Hensley: In terms of the battery cost, ten to 15 years ago, we were looking at $1,200 per kilowatt-hour, making the economics simply not feasible. Given major investments and significant advances in technology and chemistry toward the lithium-ion we see today, we see battery costs that are more like $100 to $125 per kilowatt-hour at the cell level.', 'That’s a tenfold decrease, highlighting the huge advances in technology enabling us to put a battery in a vehicle and for the unit economics of that vehicle to make sense. Again, that’s easier said than done.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What can the EV industry as a whole do to mitigate obstacles related to sustainability?', 'Russell Hensley: The auto and mobility industry must find multiple solutions that mitigate threats toward sustainability. One critical step will be to ensure that we can reuse the materials that actually go into vehicles. The amount that you reuse or recycle—be that from the battery, from the vehicle body, from other elements of the vehicle—all needs to be maximized such that we reuse the materials as opposed to looking for new sources in the ground.', 'Sustainability is critical. Adoption of techniques associated with the circular economy are key, which would help to move the mobility of people and goods toward that wonderful goal of net-zero emissions.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So given all the challenges that the players in the EV ecosystem face, how can they start to remove some of these obstacles? What can they do to ensure that all the players in the ecosystem are moving their agendas forward?', 'Russell Hensley: There are a number of things that have to happen. First, we have to design, develop, and produce a range of models that consumers find appealing. And that is increasingly the case. We discuss the uptake of different segments like pickup trucks in the US, which are very, very popular. You will have to have electric pickup trucks if there is going to be full adoption.', 'Second, those models have to be economically viable for the industry. That means that the costs of the battery have to be at a certain point where the unit economics pencil out and you make electric vehicles profitably.', 'To my earlier point, this has been quite challenging, as we’ve been at higher levels on the battery cost curve, which are now coming to be at a point where we’ve got economic equivalence between an electric and an internal-combustion-powered vehicle, in terms of the economics for the industry.', 'Third, you need talent that knows how to design, develop, and produce these vehicles at scale. Batteries, electric motors, and software systems that run these vehicles are all relatively new. And capabilities that come from the talent need to be developed too.', 'There is also the education of the sales channel, and the dealer that is selling an electric vehicle, which is completely different from traditional-vehicle sales. We also need the charging infrastructure to give the consumer confidence that they can charge at home, at work, or independently—therefore, reducing or eliminating range anxiety, which is something that we’ve had in the early days of adoption. There’s an education that’s required of the consumer.', 'There’s also a whole new set of protocols that you need for people like fire departments that deal with accidents. Dealing with an electric vehicle that has crashed and has got a chance of a thermal event is a whole new training that the folks have to go through.', 'The ecosystem is quite extensive when you begin to think about it. And it starts with an incentive, which is what you’re seeing from some of the regulations that have been released over the past 24 months that apply to charging infrastructures and purchase incentives.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How can governments help accelerate the development of a network for charging electric vehicles? Are there other levers they can use, or other ways that they can get folks fully on board with EVs?', 'Russell Hensley: The way to create a tailwind and expand the infrastructure is to initially incentivize it, because it’s a costly proposition until scale is realized. It’s not necessarily obvious where you build out a charging infrastructure. The answer to those questions depends on the use case that you’re trying to address, whether it’s a fleet of vehicles, a retailer trying to serve their consumers, or serve the fleet of vehicles that’s delivering groceries these days. It’s quite complex.', 'And it will require quite significant funding to ensure that we have the coverage that’s required in a very different world compared to the one we have today, where a gas station resides on most well-traveled corners and where you can fuel your vehicle in less than ten minutes and then drive four-hundred-miles-plus without any thoughts for range anxiety.', 'Roberta Fusaro: We talk a lot about talent gaps and talent shortages nowadays. What are the skills gaps right now around electric vehicles?', 'Russell Hensley: Like most industries, there is this digitization of the development process, the product and the environment in which the product is used. So at the end of the day, much of this transition comes down to software and having the talent that understands how to engineer and deploy the software.', 'And that’s from an industry that has been fundamentally based around mechanical systems and some electrical systems for 130 years. Now it’s pivoting to software-driven vehicles that have multiple electrical systems supported by mechanical systems.', 'There are three best practices that I’ve seen companies do. First, they’ll make an anchor hire of someone who has a high profile within software engineering. They’ll hire a high-profile software engineer and build around that anchor person. That would be one strategy.', 'The second one is you actually “aqui-hire.” You find companies that are software-led companies which you can collaborate and partner with and potentially acquire.', 'The third piece of the puzzle is, instead of using human capital to design and develop your software, you use machines. Probably, a combination of those three things is probably the way that you address the talent challenge.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thinking about how electric vehicles are produced versus traditional vehicles, what are the key differences, if any?', 'Russell Hensley: There are several fundamental differences. Probably the most obvious one is the powertrain, with one being powered by an internal-combustion engine that uses gasoline and the other being powered by an electric engine and supported by a battery.', 'In their simplest form, electric vehicles can be more efficient in terms of production. You don’t necessarily need the same amount of labor hours to assemble because there are fewer components and there are fewer moving parts.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are the implications for, say, the Detroit Three manufacturers that are used to doing things one way and now have to shift to a different model?', 'Russell Hensley: Ultimately, quite a few years down the road, we will have vehicles that drive themselves, which are so-called Level 4 (L4) or Level 5 autonomy. You’ll be able to do what you want with the time you are being transported, as you will not have any need to consciously drive your vehicle. You can obviously use that time to be productive or not. It’s an incredible opportunity. As we move toward such vehicles, mobility has the opportunity to become much safer. These vehicles are far less likely to crash into other objects, as the technology and advances in the vehicle intelligence systems will be quite profound. So, we move toward huge societal benefit in terms of reduced carbon emissions and far safer vehicles, ideally with far fewer accidents and far fewer fatal accidents.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I don’t want to feed the hype cycle around EVs, but if you’re looking into your crystal ball, when and how do you think we might reach the tipping point for electric vehicles and maybe even autonomous vehicles?', 'Russell Hensley: The tipping point for EVs has happened, given the economic parity we see in multiple use cases. There will be challenges and they will be of significance. But we’re past the tipping point.', 'There’s one use case with huge tailwind that favors electric vehicles. It’s fleets—medium and even large size. It’s often more economically beneficial to have an electric fleet, assuming that you have the charging infrastructure and the reliable vehicles that fit your use case. Today, there is significant demand for such vehicles, and a shortage of supply of smaller or medium-duty vehicles to move goods.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What can you tell us about autonomous vehicles?', 'Russell Hensley: If you think about autonomy and autonomous vehicles, it’s critical to talk about the use case and the level of autonomy. But what I think you’re referring to is Level 4, Level 5, which, in layperson’s terms, can translate into hands off and mind off. So you are not engaged at all in the direction or the speed of the vehicle.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So my trip to Canada would be completely anxiety free. I would just be sitting back.', 'Russell Hensley: It would be anxiety free because it would also figure out where that charging station is. So all you have to do is pack your cheddar cheese and Branston sandwiches and you’re all set. Maybe throw in a bottle of ginger beer to wash them down with. And now you’re going to ask me what Branston is, aren’t you? It’s like Marmite but it’s not.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I don’t know what Marmite is either.', 'Russell Hensley: Marmite is a delicious, British savory food spread based on yeast extract, made from by-products of beer brewing. I’m not sure what the marketing folks would think of that.', 'But with regard to autonomy and autonomous vehicles, it depends on what the situation is. We expect autonomy for on-street parking. It’s here today and we’ll continue to see it grow. That’s an L4, autonomous on-street parking. In the next couple of years it will be there on scale.', 'Within a few years, depending on the geography you’re in, you’ll see highway pilots and urban pilots for passenger cars. It’s a few years out. If we’re looking at driverless trucks on the highway, you’re looking at a similar time frame, maybe 2027–28, depending on the geography.', 'You have some regions that are more conservative than others in terms of the regulations and some that are really leaning into autonomy because, among other reasons, we have a shortage of drivers, given the increase in the movement of goods. And autonomy is one of the solutions to help ease that challenge.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Russell, I’m sorry to say that we’ve come up against time. But you’ve given me and our listeners lots to think about. And now I have to go off and Google Marmite and figure out what’s in there. But I did want to thank you for joining us on the podcast today.', 'Russell Hensley: Thank you. It’s been a wonderful time chatting through these things. And who knows? Maybe in a few years we’ll be talking about cars that run on Marmite.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Just like tomorrow’s electric cars, tomorrow’s companies might also be plugged in—to the importance of social responsibility, that is. Alan Murray, CEO of Fortune Media and author of the book Tomorrow’s Capitalist, explains why.', 'Alan Murray: Over the past decade, I started noticing a change in the way that business leaders were talking about their companies and how they led their companies.', 'Starting about a decade ago, I began to hear a different emphasis on the social impact of business. There was a broad sense that companies weren’t doing as much as they needed to, to ensure their positive impact on society. And that’s really what finally exploded a couple of years ago in this stakeholder capitalism movement.', 'All of us know that there are thousands of ways in the short term that you can enhance a company’s profit at the expense of society, at the expense of employees, at the expense of the long-term survival of the company.', 'As companies focus more and more on wanting to be around for ten years or 20 years or 30 years or a hundred years, those things start to disappear. You realize that you can’t be a successful company if the planet is on fire and social division is causing the political order to break down, you can’t be a successful company.', 'As a journalist who was always trying to get CEOs to talk about controversial issues about ten or 15 years ago, I noticed they were not going to talk about social or controversial political issues that didn’t directly affect their company. And that started to change maybe six or seven years ago. Marc Benioff of Salesforce was one of the leaders in this movement when he spoke out against the religious-liberties law in the state of Indiana that was seen as being discriminatory toward gay and transgender people.', 'Now we’ve seen an explosion of it. In some ways the most striking example is the one that just happened. Putin invades Ukraine, and within 15 days you had 300 companies who had come out and said, “We’re not going to do business there anymore.” CEOs are learning that the option of just saying nothing is going away.', 'The question about globalization is one of the most interesting questions about the future of business. If you look at the last quarter of the 20th century, a lot of these companies gained their success and their heft and their profits by pursuing an active policy of globalization.', 'Now we’ve had about a decade of retreat. The war in Ukraine only adds to that, and the issues I’m talking about only add to that. There is a question of “Can these companies stand for globalization and, at the same time, support their own values?” I think that’s going to be one of the big tensions of the future.', 'I was having a conversation last week with the CEO of one of the big four accounting firms. He said that even in their tax work, it used to be a question of “What are we allowed to do?” And in the past couple of years, more companies have been asking, “What’s the moral thing to do? What’s the right thing to do? What should we do?” Not just “What does the law allow us to?”', 'These pressures are not going to be reversed, and companies are going to have to figure out how to deal with them. I’m skeptical because I’m a journalist at heart, but I’m convinced that something very real is going on.', 'In March 2020, when the pandemic hit and companies realized that the economy was going to take a sharp move downward, my first instinct was to say, “All this stakeholder capitalism stuff is going to go out the window because people are going to be afraid of the bottom line and the effects on the bottom line.”', 'The pandemic, in a way, was a stakeholder crisis. Leaders said, ‘We have to make sure our people are safe and our customers are safe.’', 'What stunned me was the exact opposite happened: the pandemic, in a way, was a stakeholder crisis. Leaders said, “We have to make sure our people are safe and our customers are safe.”', 'That was probably the moment where I said, “Wow, this is real. This is not ephemeral. This is not a fad. This is a dynamic driven by fundamental business forces. And it’s not going to go away.” It may not solve our problems as quickly as we needed to, but it’s not going away.', 'Alan Murray is CEO of Fortune Media.

But wait—here’s why it’s better for those in charge to pause instead of pounce.', 'In unusually difficult situations, a counterintuitive response to stress is what many leaders should aim for, say Jacqueline Brassey, McKinsey senior knowledge expert, and McKinsey senior partner Aaron De Smet as they talk about their new book, Deliberate Calm: How to Learn and Lead in a Volatile World (HarperCollins, November 2022), on The McKinsey Podcast with host and executive editor Roberta Fusaro.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is hosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Over ten years ago, McKinsey senior partner Aaron De Smet was working so hard and traveling so much that he lost sight of dire circumstances at home.', 'Aaron De Smet: It took me a while to realize that my wife at the time had a severe addiction. And my family was not OK.', 'Roberta Fusaro: To deal with the crisis, he reacted in a way that was familiar to him.', 'Aaron De Smet: My reaction to problems that I feel passionate about is to tackle them head-on, to fix them, to control.', 'Roberta Fusaro: But trying to wield control over the situation didn’t help.', 'Aaron De Smet: The answer I came up with, I will say, did not help my family. I had to learn to truly change some pretty fundamental things about myself. Eventually, I had to learn to become a single father to two fairly traumatized girls who grew up in a very difficult situation where I initially did not show up in a way that was helpful to them.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Aaron’s self-reflection motivated him to write the book Deliberate Calm with Michiel Kruyt and Jacqui Brassey, McKinsey senior knowledge expert. This book aims to help leaders resist knee-jerk reactions to unanticipated events, which are happening more and more.', 'Roberta Fusaro: This is a special episode of The McKinsey Podcast, where we help you make sense  of our world’s toughest business challenges. I’m your host for today, Roberta Fusaro. Here’s Jacqui.', 'Jacqui Brassey: Deliberate calm is a set of skills that helps leaders make the best decisions in the moment, even when it’s tough.', 'Aaron De Smet: We’re constantly faced with new levels of uncertainty, volatility. Change is now the norm. I grew up in a world where the way we think about how to handle a crisis is outdated. This book helps leaders understand how to change their relationship with change, how to change their relationship with uncertainty, and not to shy away from it. But it also provides a better tool kit for dealing with uncertainty on an ongoing basis.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Aaron’s thoughts on crisis management were influenced by Harvard professor Dutch Leonard, who says it’s important to understand that not all crises are created equal.', 'Aaron De Smet: He mentioned that there’s a difference between what he called a routine emergency and a crisis of uncertainty.', 'A routine emergency could be a building that’s on fire. And firefighters are in a very difficult situation with respect to the nature of the fire and lives at stake. However, if it is a fairly routine fire, the firefighters have likely trained for an event like this.', 'Roberta Fusaro: But in a crisis of uncertainty, Aaron says, you can’t fall back on what you know.', 'Aaron De Smet: I often want to react based on what I’ve already learned, not what I need to learn. Or I just shut down and freak out.', 'If you are in an uncertain situation, the most important thing you can do is calm down. Take a breath. Take stock. “Is the thing I’m about to do the right thing to do?” And in many cases, the answer is no. If you were in a truly uncertain environment, if you’re in new territory, the thing you would normally do might not be the right thing.', 'Roberta Fusaro: And if resisting the temptation to react as usual is hard, this is where you can be . . .', 'Aaron De Smet: . . . very cognizant of a mindset that is reactive to protecting the status quo, where I just fall back on what I know, versus a learning mindset where I have to say, “This is an opportunity for me to learn something and evolve and adapt.”', 'Roberta Fusaro: Jacqui Brassey agrees. She says that to evolve or adapt, people have to start from a place of awareness.', 'Jacqui Brassey: It’s helpful to know that there is a process going on in our brain and body and that there is science behind it. We have a protocol in the book that we describe: very simple steps, where for four weeks you can start observing the moments that you feel triggered by a stressful situation.', 'We have a couple of structured questions to help you understand what is actually going on: What goes on in your brain? What are your thoughts? What goes on in your body? What do you feel?', 'It’s also important that we learn to connect with our body because the brain is not just above the brain stem and disconnected from the rest of the body. It’s holistic.', 'It’s also important that we learn to connect with our body because the brain is not just above the brain stem and disconnected from the rest of the body. It’s holistic.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Once you get good at objectively understanding your feelings, then you can notice what you’re doing in response to your emotions.', 'Jacqui Brassey: Are we moving toward something? Are we moving away from something? Are we trying to challenge what is ahead of us?', 'Roberta Fusaro: To give an example of deliberate calm both in action and not in action, Jacqui told a story about one business leader. His company was undergoing a large and high-profile transformation. Layoffs were on the horizon, and everyone was stressed. The leader . . .', 'Jacqui Brassey: . . . felt very responsible and like he needed to make this a huge success. But the time pressure was intense.', 'Roberta Fusaro: He wanted to move very fast, with no discussion, which created friction within the team. Sound familiar?', 'Jacqui Brassey: It is a typical example that you see in many organizational settings. This leader completely became so emotional; he went from overdrive to extreme overdrive and started shouting—so actually, the opposite of deliberate calm.', 'Another leader in the room started to have a conversation with him. But there was a difference in hierarchy. And what you also often see when there is stress, shouting, and a difference in hierarchy is that there is even more pressure on the person.', 'But this other leader really showed deliberate calm in action. He had an open posture and asked very calm and open questions to understand the situation. He even stayed calm and wasn’t bothered when he was personally attacked.', 'Eventually, he calmed down the situation and opened up the conversation. And it became a dialogue instead of a protection conversation, a fighting conversation.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How hard is it to learn to be deliberately calm?', 'Aaron De Smet: Change is hard, and if you think about how many organizations drive change, they often start with: What’s the sense of urgency? What’s the case for change, to get people’s attention and convince them that they need to pay attention to this and need to commit to doing something different? Because even small things are hard to change once you have a built-in habit.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Habits can be broken if people develop what Aaron and Jacqui call dual awareness.', 'Aaron De Smet: Dual awareness is the important connection between self-awareness and situational awareness. What is the situation and what does it call for? What are the characteristics of the situation? Is this a known situation with known solutions, where the thing I would normally tend to do is the right thing?', 'Or is this a new and different situation, where my normal habits or tendencies or reactions might not be of service? Which comes back to self-awareness: What are my normal habits and tendencies? What are the things I’m good at or not good at? What are my habitual reactions, and is that appropriate? Navigating conditions of great volatility and great uncertainty almost always requires a higher degree of dual awareness.', 'Roberta Fusaro: A good example of what happens when dual awareness is missing comes from the Netherlands. Jacqui says the minister of health there showed situational awareness but not personal awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Jacqui Brassey: The minister at the time, Bruno Bruins, was so focused on serving the country and bringing all that was needed to the table that it seems he forgot to take care of himself. It’s possible he ignored his need for rest. As a result, during a parliamentary debate about the coronavirus, he fainted on national television a couple of weeks into nonstop crisis management.', 'When we talk about dual awareness, it is not only the focus of what is happening. It is also being always in communication with what’s going on for ourselves and asking, “How can I take care of myself to sustainably serve in this situation?”', 'Roberta Fusaro: And dual awareness is not just for individuals. Teams can also develop it by examining who they are as a unit and how the unit functions.', 'Aaron De Smet: How do we as a team tend to organize around an opportunity or challenge like this? Is that the right way to do it? Do we, as a team, have collective blind spots? How do we take a step back and make ourselves more aware? But often asking the right questions means different questions, curious questions, questions of, “Yeah, but why do we do it that way again?”', 'On a team, sometimes what you learn and do differently is in collaboration with others. It’s also a collective self-awareness of the team. What are we good at as a team? Who is good at what? How do we as a team tend to swarm a problem like this, and is that the right way to do it?', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are leaders more effective or employees more productive when they implement these strategies? What do the data look like around deliberate calm?', 'Jacqui Brassey: We have our own study that we’ve done because we also train leaders in these skills. We’ve rolled out a program with a couple of thousand leaders and had a control group, so it was really a great setting to measure evidence.', 'What we found was that leaders showed three times better adaptive behaviors and outcomes and an improvement of seven and a half times in well-being versus the control group. These results were not only self-perceptions but also evaluated by others. So that is already amazing data.', 'The other data points that we have are that learning agility is the number-one driver of leader success and potential, ahead of IQ, personality-related EQ [emotional intelligence], ability-related EQ, and job experience. We also know the topics described in the book are related to overall better performance, confidence, creativity, and innovation.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The leaders trained in deliberate calm received positive feedback from peers and colleagues.', 'Aaron De Smet: What we found was that colleagues assessed people with just a little bit of training on these skills to be two to three times more effective on a range of things, from how good of a leader they were to how productive they were to how inspiring they were, and the quality of their decisions.', 'Colleagues assessed people with just a little bit of training on these skills to be two to three times more effective on a range of things.', 'Roberta Fusaro: If I’m practicing deliberate calm and I serve as a mentor to 12 people in my company, and I can role model that behavior, I imagine that the effects can be exponential.', 'Aaron De Smet: Our belief is that there’s a tipping point that helps a whole organization improve on these things. You’re putting in place psychological safety. The skills involved start creating a foundation of things that, when they all come together, create a bit of magic.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Building the foundation takes time and practice.', 'Jacqui Brassey: We’re not prescriptive about what would be good, because everybody individually should find out what works for them. But there are many ways to build these skills. The phrase “corporate athlete” sometimes comes up in our conversations. It’s the same as anybody who wants to train for a marathon or for some high-level sports. You don’t do that overnight. You practice.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How important is it to see deliberate calm as a process more so than a destination?', 'Jacqui Brassey: It is always a process. It’s a journey. Even though I am one of the coauthors on this book, I also sometimes forget to practice deliberate calm.

So there is a lot of hope. There is a lot of opportunity.

How can they reestablish meaningful connections among teams and individuals in today’s changed work environments?,"['Companies are reporting a dearth of social capital since the start of the pandemic. How can they reestablish meaningful connections among teams and individuals in today’s changed work environments?', 'Social capital, a technical term for connectivity in the workplace, is important for helping employees execute, learn, innovate, and advance in organizations. Right now, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related upheaval in office and staffing norms, it’s in short supply. But there are ways to rebuild social capital, say McKinsey senior partner John Parsons and partner Brooke Weddle on this episode of The McKinsey Podcast. Hear their conversation with editorial director Roberta Fusaro about McKinsey’s recent report on the state of social capital and why executives need to manage workplace interactions more intentionally—always, but especially now.', 'After, get to know married couple and associate partners Angela and Sebastian Sinisterra-Woods. They talk about the kind of support and impact they’ve experienced during their time at the firm—plus a handy McKinsey-derived marital lesson, too.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: We’re here today to talk about social capital, a topic that has always seemed to be this wonky term for what a lot of people call workplace connection, or connectivity. Brooke, am I oversimplifying? What is social capital? How would we define it?', 'Brooke Weddle: Social capital, simply defined, is the presence of networks, relationships, and connections within any organization or, more broadly, community or culture. It’s been studied for decades, and some of the more recent work by Robert Putnam has emphasized the impact of social capital as it relates to ties in a community.', 'McKinsey’s research looks at social capital in the context of organizations and how social capital has evolved over the course of the pandemic. Our research specifically looked at social capital in terms of three specific elements: access, motivation, and the ability to build social capital into your network—recognizing that you may have access and you may be motivated, but at the end of the day, there’s actually skill involved in building and maintaining social capital.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Why do companies need social capital? Why is it so important?', 'John Parsons: An organization is made up of individuals, teams of people, and people who lead the teams. Social capital benefits them each in different ways.', 'With regard to individuals, it’s important to have connections to facilitate greater creativity and greater learning. There’s a lot of research that shows if you are more engaged, you’re more likely to stay. Connectivity can also help with career mobility. If you’re leading teams or you’re a part of a team, social capital is a building block that ultimately leads to that connection, that innovation, and that sharing of ideas.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Brooke, is there a downside to social capital? I’d imagine if you don’t manage it well, or if you don’t manage it at all, there can be negative consequences for individuals or organizations. Is that true?', 'Brooke Weddle: It’s a nuanced concept. When you think about relationships that form the bonds around social capital, those relationships can be homogeneous, meaning they can lead to silos in an organization or, to use a very informal term, cliques.', 'We’ve seen that, in some cases, groups that are privileged in an organization can create relationships and connections that might be exclusive and not as democratic, in terms of allowing others to access them. This might be an unintended consequence of the fact that we like to hang out with people who are like us.', 'However, if we’re trying to get the full benefits of social capital in an organization, we need to be as attuned to those strong ties that connect people just as much as we need to be attuned to those weak ties that connect people. Those weak ties can lead to spontaneous collisions that allow us to interact with folks that we might not necessarily have interacted with and, in some cases, form new ideas.', 'John Parsons: It’s about the ability of an organization to manage social capital with a lens toward inclusion. The dark side comes if social capital becomes exclusionary or isn’t something that everybody can access equally. You have to be very thoughtful about how you include people.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The recent McKinsey report says many companies today are actually running low on social capital and connections. What’s creating the deficit?', 'Brooke Weddle: We were curious about how social capital had been impacted by the pandemic. There was a lot of conversations with our own clients around, “Gosh. It feels like we’re not as close to each other anymore.”', 'Or, “Seems like trust has gone down because we’re not hanging out in the hallways pre- and post-meetings.” We were curious about what actually has happened here mathematically, so we conducted a large-scale survey of US-based companies.', 'We found that access to social capital has gone way down. Specifically, fewer than 15 percent of employees reported that their network had grown. Only about a fifth of employees felt that they were more connected to people in their network.', 'Even when we looked at people’s external connections, similarly, less than 20 percent felt that those had grown. The demographic differences are both interesting and troubling.', 'Only about a fifth of employees felt that they were more connected to people in their network. Even when we looked at people’s external connections, similarly, less than 20 percent felt that those had grown.', 'When we looked at the differences between men and women, women were far less likely to have seen their internal or external networks grow during the pandemic. Similarly, when we looked at different levels in a company, we saw big differences in terms of what senior leaders reported as the growth of their network versus the front line. Only single-digit numbers were being reported by the front line in terms of the growth of their networks, relative to half of senior leaders who had seen and experienced a greater feeling of connection.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Let’s explore how individuals and companies can build back their stores of social capital. I want to have this discussion using those three lenses that you had mentioned around motivation, access, and ability. How can companies motivate employees to take the time to connect with others and build or rebuild their networks?', 'Brooke Weddle: Companies can rebuild social capital in a number of different ways. First of all, I think that the data we saw represent a call to action. In some ways we need to tell a story around social capital that allows employees to understand some of the benefits related to social capital.', 'Some of that might be intuitive. “Well, of course I want to develop relationships.” However, a deeper understanding of social capital would also include some of these weaker ties that we talked about. I remember that when I was a more junior employee starting off at McKinsey, I had a hard time wrapping my head around this idea that I needed to invest as much in some of the social interactions as just getting the model right and performing well.', 'As we see young people weigh in about their perceptions around hybrid work, they are understanding some of the trade-offs related to how to build social capital. To be clear, I think social capital can be built in a virtual context as well as an in-person context. The other way organizations can help to motivate employees is to build it formally into the performance management system. Sponsorship, meaning a relationship that is built on investing in a more junior colleague, can help incent people to develop deeper relationships.  Incenting leaders to think that way and to build connections accordingly is a helpful lever in terms of increasing motivation.', 'We also need good role modeling here. Imagine a leader saying, “We’re going to spend as much time checking in with each other at the start of the meeting as we do running through the tactics of how we’re going to get work done.” Obviously, there needs to be a balance. But I think leaders can play a big role in terms of role modeling what it looks like to place importance on the concept of social capital.', 'Roberta Fusaro: John, any other levers that companies can use to boost motivation?', 'John Parsons: On a more individual level, I was talking with a group of executives, and the discussion was about how you build your network, and how you build your network in the external environment. Coming out of the last two to two-and-a-half years, there was a broad acknowledgment that we have been quite internally focused.', 'Now it’s about being deliberate, making sure that you’re taking time to pick up the phone and scheduling meetings, and getting to meet people, and being thoughtful about what the network is.', 'In addition, you must recognize the benefit of doing this, that it is actually an important thing to do. And therefore it is OK, if not expected, that you spend some of your time doing that.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I want to turn to the access dimension. How can companies ensure that employees have access to networking opportunities, and therefore more access to social capital?', 'Brooke Weddle: It’s really important to start with some kind of baseline, meaning an analytical baseline of what social capital looks like in the organization. One analysis that we frequently see being helpful is where you identify key influencers in the organization.', 'Influential not because of hierarchy, but influential because people go to these people in the organization for advice because they trust them, because they know that this person will understand and have information about what’s happening.', 'There are analytical ways of identifying these people, and you can take that input and create a social network map of the organization. And you can figure out: Where are the bridge builders? The people who are connecting otherwise disconnected groups.', 'Where are the super influencers? The people in the organization who are connected to other influential employees in the organization and so on. Bringing some kind of rigorous analytical baseline is a really critical first starting point to having any conversation around access to social capital in the organization.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Can you provide an example, John?', 'John Parsons: A colleague shared this story with me. We were working with a client on a performance transformation, an operations transformation to improve production to get costs down.', 'It wasn’t going very well. People were not buying in. Things weren’t moving. And by chance, they added somebody to the central project management office as a finance analyst, just to record the numbers and help with reporting.', 'This individual sat quietly at the end of the table all day, recorded the numbers, was part of the team, engaged in conversations, but didn’t really say too much. But all of a sudden it turned out that people started showing up and asking questions about the transformation.', 'Leaders in the organization started engaging. People wanted to know what it was all about and actually started participating. Before we knew it, it was taking off and they were starting to see the performance improvement. What we found out afterward was that this individual who had been selected to the team was one of these super connectors that Brooke’s talking about.', 'He was the president of the social club. He was the captain of the softball team. He held a poker game at his house every Saturday night. And so he had all of these contacts and connections within the company. And when he was having those events, he would be talking about what he learned all day, and what was going on, and that it was actually not a bad thing, that they were really trying to help the company.', 'It added credence. But that wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for the fact that this individual had that social capital and had that credibility with all of his colleagues.', 'Roberta Fusaro: That’s a great story. Finally, I wanted to get to the ability dimension. I’m curious about what sort of structures or resources companies can use to boost people’s ability to build social capital in the workplace.', 'Brooke Weddle: The research showed that the numbers in terms of ability were higher relative to access and motivation.', 'Fifty percent of employees reported they know how to build out their network and have the time to do it. So it might just be in general more of a challenge to gain access and muster motivation.', 'That being said, these are perceptions of ability. One thing that I’ve seen in working with organizations is it’s important to help to invest in employees’ understanding of the different kinds of social capital. Similar to what we were talking about before, there are strong ties. And those can even be friendship ties. There are also weak ties in an organization.', 'You can very quickly understand, “Gosh. My network is a little bit biased to having these really strong connections,” which is terrific. “But how can I create more of these weak ties to bridge to different parts of the organization, which might open up different opportunities?”', 'Raising an employee’s awareness around these different ties and the function or the specific functionality of those ties can be a real game changer, especially for people who are trying to advance in their career and understand the landscape of opportunity and development.', 'Roberta Fusaro: John, are there any other points around ability that you would like the add here?', 'John Parsons: I want to be careful when we talk about social capital, because it’s not always social. It’s not the idea of: How do you build connections through after-work activities, etcetera?', 'I know a lot of people who consider networking to be going out for drinks, or going to a big dinner with hundreds of people and you’re supposed to work the room. It doesn’t have to be that at all. In fact, I would argue that’s actually quite ineffective.', 'If you think about it in a work context, you build these social connections when you help somebody, when you go out of your way to be a sponsor, to create an opportunity to introduce them to somebody, to show that you actually take a genuine interest and care in the individual. They will reciprocate, or they will pass it on to somebody else. All of those small actions end up creating a social bond and social capital within the organization.', 'You build these social connections when you help somebody, when you go out of your way to be a sponsor, to create an opportunity to introduce them to somebody. . . . They will pass it on to somebody else.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there ways that companies can make physical changes or otherwise make it easier for folks to build social capital or to make these connections?', 'John Parsons: We recognize that the physical space that we had before the pandemic actually doesn’t make sense for us today. Part of that is because now people are spending a lot more time working hybrid or working on Zoom. So open-concept seating just doesn’t make sense.', 'We’re literally redesigning and renovating the office to create both more closed-door spaces—so more single meeting rooms, single offices, small meeting rooms where people can get together—and maintain the larger open areas that are designed and purposed for having lunch together, having a coffee, and sitting down and talking. You have to do both. And if we don’t make the physical changes for the ability for people to work, they’re not going to come to the office at all, so you lose the second benefit of those social connections.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Brooke, anything to add there?', 'Brooke Weddle: What I’ve seen other leaders think through is: What are my own biases around work and working in the office versus working at home? And how can I actually modulate those to be a little bit more open-minded around what actually is possible?', 'I personally have a bias to being in the office and being around people. I’m a very extroverted person. But I think I’ve learned that there are ways to connect virtually that I might not honestly have been exposed to had it not been for this experience that we had during the pandemic.', 'Instead of reverting back to a world in which we are more dominated by this in-person work, we should learn from some of those experiences and readjust our own notions so that we can create effective models that might actually be a little bit more diverse and inclusive of different preferences.', 'Roberta Fusaro: With or without the pandemic, what are some best practices for maintaining relationships over time?', 'Brooke Weddle: It’s a little bit like one’s physical health—it takes some focused attention. It requires taking stock.', 'Through the research, we saw that social capital can be fragile. If neglected, it can atrophy quite quickly, with those numbers going down so significantly in terms of the network that people reported and the network growth during the pandemic, especially for groups that are in some ways already at a disadvantage.', 'Women have left the workforce in disproportionately high numbers. And they’re the ones who were seeing the social capital having been reduced the most, relative to men. It’s concerning. The best thing to do is focus time and attention on it and ensure that, just as John said at the start, the approach is inclusive, so that you build and you maximize the positive impacts of social capital, of which there are many.', 'John Parsons: One trap to avoid falling into is that, yes, you have to be conscious of it. Yes, you have to keep working at it. It can atrophy quite quickly. At the same time, it’s not like you should carve out two days a week and say, “It’s Tuesday and Wednesday. It’s my social day where I’m going to go build my network.”', 'A client of mine recently said, “It’s right under your nose.” Every interaction you have with somebody, whether it’s a business interaction or otherwise, is an opportunity to build that social connection. You have to have the mindset that it’s integrated into everything you do on a daily basis.', 'Roberta Fusaro: When it comes to inclusion, are there any traps that executives can fall into and ways to get around those traps?', 'John Parsons: One story I’ll share is that I was speaking with an executive who shared that since they took on a new role, they’ve been invited out to play golf almost every week.', 'They’ve told me, “But I don’t play golf. It’s not something that I’m interested in.” So that’s an example where it’s not deliberately so, but it’s excluding a group of people who are just not interested in golf.', 'The solution is just don’t be over reliant on that. If the way that you build a strong network at your organization is at 4:00 p.m. every day, or 5:00 p.m., everybody goes out to drink, you are by definition excluding people who don’t want to go there, don’t drink, have to get home for kids, any number of reasons.', 'McKinsey defaults to a lot of wind downs where people get together and have drinks at the end of the day. I had a number of folks in the office for various religious reasons who just didn’t drink. So we actually went and bought a bunch of specialty sodas and juice so that when we had a wind down, they actually had something different other than the normal soft drinks and bubbly out of the fridge.', 'Brooke Weddle: I do think you’ve got to challenge your own biases. If going to golf is great for you, fine. Keep going to golf. But recognize that you should do a few other things as well to broaden the inclusive aspect of building that social capital.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Brooke, John, this has been terrific. Thanks for joining us today.', 'Brooke Weddle: Thank you, Roberta. It was a lot of fun.', 'John Parsons: Thank you, Roberta.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Angela and Sebastian Sinisterra-Woods were building up a kind of social capital before they joined McKinsey. They were dating. Now they’re married and work as associate partners at the firm. They join us to share the kind of support and impact they’ve experienced during their time at the firm—and how whiteboards aren’t just for conference rooms.', 'Sebastian Sinisterra-Woods: Angela and I met at a Halloween party. Neither of us were wearing a memorable costume.', 'Angela Sinisterra-Woods: I was dressed as a nerd, so not that different from my usual attire. I attended a McKinsey information session while I was at Duke [University]. At that point, I had zero clue what consulting was, certainly no idea who McKinsey was. What really drew me was the opportunity to work across sectors, the public, social and private sector, and the opportunity to learn from a wide variety of industries and functions.', 'Sebastian Sinisterra-Woods: The apprenticeship model is one of the hallmarks of the McKinsey experience, and it certainly delivers because you’re never on any one project for too long. Every year you get multiple reps working with different colleagues, different peers, and different senior partners and partners at McKinsey. Each of them has had hundreds of projects, working with different companies, different CEOs. So just by virtue of working with them, you also get to absorb a lot of those learnings.', 'The apprenticeship model is one of the hallmarks of the McKinsey experience, and it certainly delivers because you’re never on any one project for too long.', 'Angela Sinisterra-Woods: All of my work is with a practice that we call SHaPE, which is our social healthcare and public entities practice. I find that my work with those organizations is so mission driven, and it gets me excited every day for work.', 'Sebastian Sinisterra-Woods: We were serving a hotel operator that was trying to expand in North America. They were starting from scratch, and I was able to get very close to the head of North America. I was there with him every single day in the room, and the relationship evolved very quickly. Within a matter of days, it went from, “McKinsey helped me with these things” to, “Hey, you’re Sebastian; we’re on the same side of the table. I want you in all my meetings. I want you to knock on my door as much as you want.”', 'This client has since left, but we catch up every few months just to see how each other is doing. So it truly became a friendship.

Generation is McKinsey’s nonprofit that focuses on training and placing people into life-changing careers that might otherwise be inaccessible to them.', 'I was launching new cities and then running US operations across all of our US cities. I was making a difference in the lives of the Generation students who we were training and helping to get jobs and for the employers who would ultimately hire our students.', 'Sebastian Sinisterra-Woods: McKinsey teaches you to be very organized.

The whiteboard has a list of things that we need to do for the house with little checkboxes, and it has an owner assigned.

New research reveals why—and how to help employees begin to thrive again.', 'Yoga. Therapy. Meditation. Yes, wellness perks are helpful, but they’re not a panacea for workplace stress. In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Erica Coe—a McKinsey partner and coleader of the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI)—speaks with McKinsey Global Publishing’s Lucia Rahilly about why burnout has hit record levels over the past two years and what leaders can do to create a path toward lasting change.', 'Afterward, senior partner Tiffany Burns describes one of her rookie moments: talking a client down from sending an email when angry.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Lucia Rahilly and Roberta Fusaro.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Erica, it’s always such an inspiration to talk to you, and belated congratulations on the launch of the McKinsey Health Institute.', 'Erica Coe: Thank you. It has been a very exciting couple months, to be sure.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve talked about burnout before on The McKinsey Podcast, but given that it has almost become a buzzword, I’d like to start by ensuring we’re all on the same page about what we mean when we use that term. What does it feel like to be burned out? What are the symptoms of burnout versus feeling lackluster or just, say, limping toward vacation?', 'Erica Coe: You’re exactly right that it has become a buzzword, so it’s helpful to ground ourselves. According to the World Health Organization, burnout is an occupational workplace phenomenon. It’s driven by a chronic imbalance between your job demands—for example, how heavy your workload pressure is—and your job resources. It might be how autonomous or supported you feel at work. It’s that disconnect and imbalance between demands and resources. It’s often correlated with anxiety and depression, and a potential predictor of broader mental-health challenges. That’s why it’s so important to get a grasp on some of the burnout challenges that many employees are facing, to ensure that employers can intervene now.', 'To your question of what characterizes burnout, it’s often marked by extreme tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty with cognitive and emotional processes. It’s important to understand those symptoms and tendencies fully.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Prepandemic, folks used to talk a lot about being busy. It was a badge of honor to be busy, a good thing. How did we go from being busy to being burned out? Did the pandemic play a role in that?', 'Erica Coe: I think it certainly did. If anything, of all the challenges that have come about because of the pandemic, one of the silver linings is the increased awareness and open dialogue around mental health and the importance of positive mental health and well-being and of investing in that.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s turn to the research you recently undertook along with colleagues from the McKinsey Health Institute. Why did you make employee burnout a focus for MHI?', 'Erica Coe: We were already facing a global mental-health crisis before the pandemic. Now, after living through two and a half years of COVID-19, the crisis has only grown. With such an urgent need around a very core part of health, we knew that the only way we could improve health holistically is by first addressing mental health. Mental health impacts physical health. It impacts social health. It impacts spiritual health. You can’t have good overall health without good mental health. So we felt that to add years to life and life to years, we had to focus initially on the urgent priority of mental health.', 'And then there’s the question of why employers? Every day, employers are impacting the health and the mental health of their employees and workforces. So if we could find a way—through convening, collaborating, research, and innovation—to start to change the behavior of many of these employers, we felt that it could be one way to have an impact at scale. We also feel that we are very much at a tipping point for change. This is a unique moment in time. If we can find what research, what innovations can be introduced, we might be able to shift things in a new direction.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How global is this phenomenon of burnout?', 'Erica Coe: Interestingly, very global. We conducted a survey of 15,000 employees across 15 countries, on every continent around the world, and found consistently high burnout rates. One difference we found across these countries was the cultural context: how much stigma or discrimination exists in a workplace, how comfortable employees are sharing certain things, and the level of support they might feel from their employer.', 'A fascinating step in the research was translating into local languages all of the surveys we deployed across the 15 countries. At the stage of translating, we realized that there may not be a word that characterizes mental health or mental health in the workplace. And you start to see stigma in many ways, even in designing the survey instrument, but also in the findings. Understanding the stigma and the broader cultural context is critical in highlighting what interventions will work. Depending on the culture and environment that an employee is in, very different approaches need to be taken to support employees and their family members and broader communities, which these negative impacts trickle down to.', 'Many large global employers have a footprint across a number of regions around the world. It’s also important to understand how to effectively support their workforce more broadly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: So burnout is bad, it’s potentially at a tipping point, and employers are keenly aware of it, particularly in such a tight talent market. We have seen record quit rates and churn, as we know from our Great Attrition/Great Attraction research. What are companies doing to help employees now?', 'Erica Coe: If we look at investment rates—what employers are pouring into interventions—often investment is on the wellness side, and it isn’t moving the needle. Burnout rates are continuing to increase, despite many organizations committing to this, making it a C-suite agenda priority, and trying to find ways to support employees.', 'Burnout rates are continuing to increase, despite many organizations committing to this, making it a C-suite agenda priority, and trying to find ways to support employees.', 'In a recent survey, four out of five HR leaders said that they consider employee mental health and well-being a top priority. There are billions of dollars around the globe going into wellness benefits. But we think the challenge is that almost all the focus is on remediating symptoms rather than getting at the root cause of employee burnout. Instead, employers should step back and reflect on the structural challenges of the environment, which may be causing the burnout in the first place. If the root causes aren’t fixed, then you’re going to continue to put your employees in environments that are increasing burnout.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Sometimes I’m afraid, in my own life, that these wellness initiatives—although I’m super grateful for them—risk creating another work stream. In other words, when you’re thinly stretched, adding some vinyasa 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             A style of physical yoga practice.\\r               \\r \\r  into the mix might feel incredibly welcome in theory. But it is daunting to actualize in practice, unless other portfolio adjustments, like reducing deliverables, are made in parallel. What’s the risk of wellness becoming another work stream for employees?', 'Erica Coe: The way you framed it is exactly right. Wellness is certainly critical, but in and of itself it’s not sufficient. It’s very important that individuals learn different resilience skills, different coping strategies, and that there is an individual approach to support.', 'Where we often get burnout wrong is assuming that it is purely an individual experience—something for a person to fix and get better on their own, and we’ll equip that person with all the tools they need to fix it. We often miss the impact that is coming from how our teams, how our leaders, how the broader organizations are influencing the way people are experiencing their lives at work. Starting to pay attention to the systemic issues and really getting into some of the root causes will be what’s needed to unlock real change here.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk about those root causes. What are some of the drivers behind these pervasive burnout challenges?', 'Erica Coe: One of the things that we asked in our survey across the 15 countries was intended to find some of the strongest predictors of burnout symptoms and other negative outcomes. One of these drivers, by a large margin, was what we refer to as toxic workplace behavior. Toxic behaviors are things that leave you, or leave an employee, feeling unvalued, unsafe—something that might feel like a demeaning treatment, noninclusive behavior, really extreme competition, abuse of management, or unethical behaviors. All those become almost a cultural norm that can really feed into toxic behavior. In our survey, one in four employees reported high rates of toxic behavior at work.', 'Through our research, we wanted to find out if toxic behavior at work leads to higher rates of burnout. Is it predictive in any way? The subset of employees who reported experiencing these high levels of toxic behavior were eight times more likely to experience burnout symptoms—significantly higher. In terms of action, these employees were also six times more likely to report that they intended to leave their employer in the next couple of months. One interesting finding that I think came from other recent research is that often the culture of an organization is one of the biggest predictors of the rate of resignation—ten times more predictive than compensation.', 'The subset of employees who reported experiencing high levels of toxic behavior were eight times more likely to experience burnout symptoms.', 'Our research revealed something about the broader environment—an interesting angle and finding for employers to consider. Are they even aware of their employees’ baseline current state? Where do you stand as an employer across some of these aspects?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s acknowledge that leaders need to do more. How can employers take on toxic behavior in the workplace?', 'Erica Coe: One way that employers can approach toxic behavior is to treat it as a lack of competence. If you’re looking for a skill set that has to be demonstrated at any given level, embed positive and supportive behavior as a skill. That would mean that it starts to be incorporated into performance reviews. You start to ensure you’re getting indicators in upward feedback, and you have measures and ways of picking up signs of toxic behavior.', 'Another aspect is trying to focus on the degree to which you are cultivating supportive, psychologically safe work environments. It isn’t just about removing or preventing toxicity; it’s also about amplifying compassionate leadership, for example, or cultivating a supportive environment.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How can the leadership send the message that they have begun to take these steps? How can they communicate to their employees that they care about mental health and that they care about their community’s well-being?', 'Erica Coe: Communication is a big one. Our research revealed a feeling that leaders aren’t listening to their people nearly enough. Besides communicating, it is also important to take action. That means not only celebrating successful examples of work environments and things that seem to be working but also clearly showing how you are addressing toxic-workplace behavior and making a clear change so that people feel safer and more comfortable raising issues in the future.', 'Leaders should also come up with time-bound, measurable goals around mental health. This can be daunting. How are you going to prioritize employee mental health and well-being as an organization? The more ways you can come up with—discrete, quick wins so you can start to demonstrate to your employees that mental health matters—the better.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Another of the issues you mentioned in the report is inclusion, which is a topic that McKinsey has published a lot on. It can still feel elusive in many workplaces. What are some of the steps leaders can take to create a more inclusive environment for their employees?', 'Erica Coe: There are a few different ways. Thinking about the composition of the board and leadership and creating a safe space for any colleague to feel comfortable—that’s a vital step toward inclusion. And that means thinking through leadership and diversity at the highest level—taking an expanded definition of diversity, equity, and inclusion to explicitly include neurodiversity. Often what happens is that a company defines inclusion too narrowly: “We have our diversity and inclusion strategy, there’s a specific officer who will be in charge of it, and it goes here within the organization.” Instead, take a broader approach. Think across the whole workplace about certain setups, workflows, and other ways teams might be set up that could promote inclusiveness and minimize conscious and unconscious bias. Creating a supportive workplace with widely available flexibility and customization is a significant way to help people with mental-health conditions—disclosed or undisclosed—overcome barriers.', 'Lucia Rahilly: You have done a lot of research on stigma. Say a few words about the way coming forward about burnout, and about mental-health issues in general, can create concern about being stigmatized—and about what leaders might do to mitigate that concern.', 'Erica Coe: The fact that, around the world, we’re having such conversations on burnout is great. The fact that McKinsey’s doing a podcast on burnout is great. These are all steps in the right direction. This shows that people are more comfortable acknowledging some of the real challenges that everybody faces.', 'It is becoming more accepted and normal to realize that to be at your best and be effective as a leader, it’s critical that you have moments and periods of recovery and resilience. For employers, it’s critical to acknowledge that they have accountability and responsibility for whether or not their employees are feeling burned out. That isn’t just about the number of hours an employee works. It’s the broader culture. Recognizing that takes courage. It’s a big step, because it’s a big responsibility for an employer to be willing to address burnout.', 'Without finding a way to even begin the dialogue in a safe way, it’s really hard to make change happen. When we think about it, looking across the world globally, everybody knows somebody who has been affected by a mental-health challenge—whether it’s something that they’re going through now or something that they experienced in the past or that they may experience in the next couple of months. Being able to openly share experiences, especially at a leadership level, starts to make a difference.', 'On the topic of stigma, one of the stats that always stands out to me was in a survey that we did last year of a large number of employees. Over a third of them—37 percent of the employees with a stated mental-health challenge—indicated that they would avoid treatment because they didn’t want anyone in their workplace finding out about their condition. If we think about burnout as a first step along a slippery slope toward broader mental-health challenges, by addressing stigma head on and opening a dialogue around it, we can make a very big difference.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Most leaders are well intentioned. They don’t want employees to burn out. They certainly don’t want most employees to leave. What’s the best way for leaders to get a baseline on burnout in their organization and then, vitally, to understand whether they’re making progress as they start to take some of these steps that you’re describing?', 'Erica Coe: Measurement is critical. It’s impossible to truly hold yourself accountable as a leader or as an organization if you aren’t measuring. Measurement also brings responsibility with it. If you’re going to conduct a baseline study, then there’s an expectation by your workforce that you’re going to do something with the information and that change will happen.', 'If you don’t do a baseline at all or don’t ask these questions to really understand the current state of your workforce, we know that burnout is getting worse. The more you find out now, the more you show commitment early because you care and you’re asking. Then this equips you with information and insights so you can make the type of targeted interventions that have to happen.', 'The McKinsey Health Institute has launched a free open-access survey for any employer around the world. It gets a baseline of the current state of employee mental health and well-being, and gets some insights so you can start to target what interventions might make a difference. The mandate of the McKinsey Health Institute is to ensure we’re sharing everything back for the benefit and learning of others. Employers who take the survey are committing to share their data for broader learning and research in a sanitized database where we’re starting to aggregate findings from employers around the world.', 'There are also a number of ways to get a standardized measurement of burnout and then to measure that alongside other key performance metrics, such as financial metrics, safety, equality, and employee turnover. You could imagine a world in which burnout becomes a standard metric on an operational dashboard that any employer maintains, regardless of industry or sector or geography.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Last question. In recent months we’ve entered a new period of economic volatility. Inflation is high, recession is arguably imminent. Leaders are facing one of the most difficult operating environments they have encountered in years. How optimistic are you that we’ll be able to prioritize and resolve burnout in this changing and destabilizing climate?', 'Erica Coe: If the war for talent is less critical and there are budget constraints, one thing that certainly could happen is that there’s less of a need to be investing in employee mental health and well-being. I’d emphasize some of the well-documented evidence on the impact of employee mental health and well-being on the long-term sustainability of an organization. Don’t lose sight of that long-term goal. If there is any moment to double down on the mental health of your workforce, it’s now. This will pay off in the long run. There is a clear benefit to employers. But focusing only on the short term, which may lead employers to turn away from this, would certainly have a negative impact in the long term.', 'The McKinsey Health Institute recently became a founding member of the World Wellbeing Movement. A lot of the dialogue there is around how to redefine ESG, 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             Environmental, social, and governance.\\r               \\r \\r  with health in the center. We are also thinking about sustainability as the overall health and mental health and well-being of an organization. I hope that we can continue to strengthen the evidence base and the incentives there. Regardless of the broader economic environment, we want to show that it does pay for employers to be investing in the mental health of the workforce. Hopefully, that will keep us on the right path.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Thanks so much for joining us, Erica.', 'Erica Coe: Thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Though it might not cause burnout, giving tough feedback to a colleague can cause discomfort. Senior partner Tiffany Burns can relate and shares how she persuaded her client not to send an email to a coworker during a fit of frustration. This comes from our My Rookie Moment series.', 'Tiffany Burns: I was on a project, and it was the first time that I was stepping into the role of project manager. A very new experience, in a big role—you’re the quarterback of the team and you need to be the one guiding the team and integrating all of the work that we’re doing. I was working with a new client and in a new role. I knew that a lot was going to be different and that it was going to be challenging.', 'My new client was a great executive, in an organization in the retail and consumer space, which I often did work for as an associate. She was having a bit of a challenge with one of the other executives who was part of the project that she was working on. In that context, she was super frustrated and felt that this colleague wasn’t being collaborative and that they were not on the same page. I remember her having a pretty explosive conversation in person with that colleague and her writing an email to that colleague in response to that interaction.', 'We all know that when you’re upset or frustrated that is probably not the right time to write a message. She had drafted the email very ferociously: “here’s how I feel and what I perceived in this interaction and what I don’t think is right.” She called me into her office and said, “I trust your judgment. Can you take a look at this email and give me your thoughts?” I read the email, and there was no way I could provide any constructive criticism—criticism that would get it to something that made sense for her to send to the colleague. I felt that sending this email wasn’t a good idea.', 'In a bold movement, I crossed out the email and said, “I don’t think you should send this email. I don’t think this is the tone and the perspective you want to take, given the issue. I really think that you need to go and have a conversation and talk about why you found the interaction challenging and how you could do better moving forward.”', 'Coming out of this interaction, my relationship with this client went to the next level. She really appreciated the amount of care and concern I had, and how important it was for me that she responded the appropriate way.', 'This was a big moment for me—to tell my senior client something that was somewhat personal and, basically, to say, “The thing you’re going to do is a totally bad idea.” The good news is that coming out of this interaction, my relationship with this client went to the next level. She really appreciated the amount of care and concern I had, and how important it was for me that she responded the appropriate way and that I was willing to take a risk and communicate that to her.']","[[-1.8017578   2.4667969   1.1181641  ...  0.7167969  -0.11749268

McKinsey associate partner Bonnie Dowling says yes. In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, she speaks with editorial director Roberta Fusaro about McKinsey’s latest research on the Great Attrition. This time, the team analyzed data from multiple countries and identified five types of worker personalities that, if catered to appropriately, could help fill all those open positions.', 'After, we’ll hear from Catherine Price, author of Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again, a book that was featured in our Author Talks series, who says fun is not a treat, but a tool.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Bonnie, thank you for joining the podcast.', 'Bonnie Dowling: I’m excited to be here, Roberta. Thank you for having me.', 'Roberta Fusaro: It seems like companies can’t find enough workers, and they can’t fill jobs fast enough. It also seems like we’re seeing a lot of people who are still leaving companies at just as great a rate. What did McKinsey’s most recent research on the Great Attrition reveal about these comings and goings?', 'Bonnie Dowling: This is our second or even third installment of the Great Attrition/Great Attraction research. This time, we surveyed over 13,000 individuals from six different countries. We looked at Australia, Canada, India, Singapore, the UK, and the US, across 16 industries and included people across all ages, as well as incomes.', 'We found that people are continuing to quit their jobs. They are going to different industries. They are leaving the workforce entirely. These things haven’t necessarily changed since our original research despite the fact that the economy and the world has changed, which begs a question about what’s really going on and the disconnect between employers and employees and why we haven’t been able to fix that.', 'Roberta Fusaro: As you mentioned, we’ve been looking at labor trends since the onset of COVID-19. Are these numbers much different? Are things getting any better?', 'Bonnie Dowling: We did this research to understand what those trends were and what was happening, especially as we saw some things happen in the broader economy, like economic uncertainty overall.', 'However, what we’ve seen is, when it comes to worker mentality, it has not caused a change. In August 2021, when we ran this research and a very similar survey, 40 percent of employees said they were at least somewhat likely to leave their jobs in the next three to six months. When we ran this research again April 2022, we found that the same amount were at least somewhat likely to leave their jobs in the next three to six months.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Is this true across the board? Is this true across all industries? Is it true at all levels?', 'Bonnie Dowling: There’s some variation. What’s interesting about this fundamental shift that maybe is not a trend, is it is striking across all levels, from frontline employees to executives. It’s also striking across all industries. Yes, you see higher churn in areas like retail or hospitality that historically have always had higher churn. But in finance or insurance organizations you’re seeing high levels of churn as well.', 'Roberta Fusaro: In the report on the Great Attrition research, you and your coauthors mentioned that “The tried and true approaches to finding and keeping employees aren’t working anymore.” Why is that?', 'Bonnie Dowling: Compensation is table stakes. If you’re not offering a competitive wage, you’re not in the game to start with. But it’s not enough anymore. What we’re seeing is there are different types of people who are looking for different things, especially those who’ve stepped out of the workforce entirely.', 'What’s interesting right now is we can’t afford to ignore those who have stepped out. Why? Because there are not enough people looking for jobs. There are not enough people in the workforce to fill the number of jobs we have openings for, at least not in the US.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What’s most fascinating about the most recent Great Attrition research is that you’ve identified these worker personas, breakdowns of what different types of workers might be looking for in the workplace, and therefore what employers need to do to attract them. How did you come up with these personas?', 'Bonnie Dowling: We started to look at those who had quit jobs without a job in hand, and thus had taken a step out. We also looked at those who quit jobs without a job in hand but returned to the workforce and those who had quit and returned to different industries.', 'We looked at a variety of people who had left their jobs over the course of the pandemic. And we did a cluster analysis around what they said would either bring them back into the workforce, would bring them back to a traditional job within the workforce, or what had brought them back. That’s what allowed us to start to identify these different groups.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are the personas?', 'Bonnie Dowling: There are five: the traditionalists, the do-it-yourselfers, the idealists, the caregivers, and the relaxers.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Let’s start with the traditionalists. Who are they, and what are they looking for in the workplace?', 'Bonnie Dowling: These are the folks who didn’t quit their jobs during the pandemic. If they did quit, they moved immediately into another very traditional job. They’re the folks who are motivated by the same things that motivated us in 2017 and 2019. They’re dependable for employers looking for employees. They want a clear path to advancement. They want competitive compensation. They want a workplace where they enjoy their colleagues and have inspirational leaders.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What’s tough about attracting and retaining this type of employee, if anything?', 'Bonnie Dowling: What’s tough about traditionalists is there’s not enough of them left. If we think about how many people have quit their jobs over the course of the pandemic, in the US alone it’s about a third of the workforce. That means only about two-thirds are what we would classify as traditionalists.', 'Given the number of job openings we have today, which is about double, even in our most recent numbers from June, even those ones point to there being almost double the number of job openings as there are people looking for jobs. That means you have to look beyond the traditionalist employee. They may be easy to attract, they may be easy to recruit, but if there are not enough of them, you can’t depend on filling your gaps with only them. That’s why you need to look at the other personas.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Let’s hear more about the do-it-yourselfers. Who are they?', 'Bonnie Dowling: The do-it-yourselfers are a group of people who are still working, but they’ve gone on to start their own businesses or become contractors or join the gig economy. They tend to be in the 25- to 45-year-old age range.', 'They really value flexibility, meaningful work, and compensation. To get this group back, you’re competing with them, because they’ve created something for themselves that’s paying the bills, that’s providing them a sense of purpose, and gives them all of the flexibility they could ever want, because they’re their own boss. Getting them back means you’ve got a bit of an uphill battle, but it’s also probably the largest group out there.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How do companies then compete with this new set of competitors?', 'Bonnie Dowling: Exactly. How do you prove you’re a better boss than someone is to themselves? It’s going to be a challenge for sure. Companies need to emphasize their sense of purpose and their mission.', 'How do you prove you’re a better boss than someone is to themselves? It’s going to be a challenge for sure. Companies need to emphasize their sense of purpose and their mission.', 'The other thing companies can offer that is difficult for an individual upstart is thinking through your full benefit package. Not just your compensation, although having a steady, more uncertain-economy-proof compensation package is helpful.', 'You also have to think through what benefits you have that are different and more attractive. Beyond that, one of the key things individuals get by working for themselves is flexibility. I started hearing executives talking about employees leaving in droves when they told me they’d announced their return-to-office policy. They thought they were being flexible by offering things like “Three days in office, two days’ work from wherever you want. It just can’t be Mondays and Fridays.”', 'They were shocked to see people quit. And the first thing I said was, “Well, you’re sending the inherent message that you don’t trust your employees not to take a four-day weekend when you put in that policy.” They were a bit confused by that but started to recognize that maybe that wasn’t the message they wanted to send to employees that had kept the lights on through the pandemic.', 'Now, as those return-to-office policies and approaches are starting to materialize, we see more people and more organizations thinking through what that’s going to look like, even if it is going to change and evolve as the virus continues to change and evolve. If you don’t take into account flexibility—and not just flexibility of location but also the time of work, how we work, all of those pieces—you will not be able to attract the do-it-yourselfers back.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are caregivers looking for, and who are they?', 'Bonnie Dowling: It probably doesn’t come as a surprise that flexibility is going to be a very important factor for caregivers. They’re predominantly women. They’re aged 18 to 44. They’re folks who have children at home or maybe elderly parents. They need flexibility to live in both their role as a caregiver and as an employee.', 'What we see here are former employees who may want to return. They may have enjoyed that sense of purpose and the ability to advance that they got from their career. They may be traditionalists at heart, but what they found over the course of the pandemic was that it wasn’t working to both be a parent or a child with aging parents. It wasn’t working to be a caregiver and employee.', 'If you think about things like the skyrocketing cost of childcare and how it became so unreliable over the course of the pandemic, and then you think about how many employers have punitive policies in place if you’re tardy or have an absence, it started to not have the right ROI.', 'If I’m spending the majority of my after-tax paycheck on childcare and yet I’m also getting dinged at work because I get a call from the school at 7 in the morning that says, “We’ve gone virtual for the day because there is an exposure,” the ROI isn’t there.', 'So people started stepping out. If we want to attract them—and many of these individuals would like to return, it seems—we need to think about how we can truly create flexibility and how we can align the benefit packages we offer to their needs. So you see the increased provision of childcare, of on-site childcare, of benefits like that.', 'One of the other benefits I really liked when I spoke with a company recently was thinking about how they could offer housecleaning or landscaping benefits. And their thought was, “You know what? A lot of people would enjoy these benefits.”', 'It turns out that there’s a lot of things we do outside of work that don’t give us a great sense of fulfillment or pleasure or joy. And if, as employers, we can look at what some of those things are and we can help take those off their plates, we can actually give back some work–life balance and ultimately flexibility to our employees.', 'Roberta Fusaro: This next persona is also of particular interest to me because my older son falls into this category of the idealist. Who are the idealists and what are they looking for? What can companies do to bring them into the fold?', 'Bonnie Dowling: It’s probably not surprising that the idealists are our younger folks. They’re aged 18 to 24. Many of them are students. They may be part-timers. They’re not encumbered by the same responsibilities that those of us who may be caregivers or well into our careers and have mortgages and other responsibilities, car payments, things like that—they’re not worried about those things.', 'As a result, they’re focused on different things. Flexibility remains top of mind for them. Maybe it’s to work with their school schedule. Maybe it’s to pursue some of their passion areas. We know the generation entering the workforce right now, Gen Z, or the digital natives, are really thoughtful about the work–life balance piece and not wanting to work forever or work to live. They want to live and have a job. So the flexibility is really important; so is development and advancement. They want to see that there’s a career path that they can grow. They also want meaningful work. Purpose is very important to this group.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The last persona on the list, but by no means the least, is a group we’re calling the relaxers. Can you talk a little bit more about this group?', 'Bonnie Dowling: Many of them are the folks who have taken an early retirement. It’s people who have retired or they’re just not looking for work. They don’t really have a reason to come back. But we also know there are things that could bring them back. We also know, given the gap that we have, that we need to figure out a way to bring them back.', 'They’re looking for something that’s purpose-driven, maybe something that relates to a legacy they would like to leave. They’re maybe not as motivated by compensation the way others are, because they probably have enough money to live comfortably for a while. That’s why they’ve retired and stepped out. They want the flexibility element. They’re going to want to work with friends.', 'We call them the “Gronks” because of what happened with Rob Gronkowski, the American football player. He retired. His best friend, Tom Brady, called him and said, “Hey, you said you were retired. I was thinking about it too. But do you want to come back and win a Super Bowl?” And he came back to play. It was a short-term contract. He did a year-to-year approach. He got to work with his best friend, and he had the opportunity to do something big.', 'Those are the personas, and those are the people we have to start thinking about, and how we can broaden our employee value proposition to encompass those different types of people coming in, and how we can focus on the elements of our employee value proposition that will be most appealing to those individual groups that we want to attract.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Is there any overlap among the personas, or do you truly fall into one category or another?', 'Bonnie Dowling: There’s a lot of opportunity to move between them. If I think of myself as an example, I believe I’m probably a traditionalist at heart, because I haven’t quit my job. I have a lower risk tolerance. I want to know where my paycheck is coming from. However, I’m also a mom. I have a lot of responsibilities at home. And I’m burned out, like 42 percent of women out there, according to our Women in the Workplace research.', 'Could I easily become a caregiver and step out? Yes, I could. There’s a lot of opportunity to move between these. Could you be both at once? You could probably be both at once as well. It’s a matter of how you’re prioritizing the different offerings of an employer and how you would think about what it would take to bring you back.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The framework of the personas is a great tool for companies to look at their employee value propositions. There are certain characteristics common across them all around flexibility, compensation, development, purpose. Apart from getting a better understanding of the talent pool through these personas, what else can companies do to address the attrition problem longer term?', 'Bonnie Dowling: There are four different levers they can take. There is what our article addresses, which is, how do you attract talent that is out there and looking, or on the sidelines looking, to get back in? We also ask, how do you retain the talent you currently have? You need to create a culture that’s welcoming, sticky, and doesn’t mean bringing people back into the office. Think about what it is you can do, how you can make a concerted effort to show employees you care about who they are and build a culture even in a virtual environment.', 'When executives tell me, “Aren’t you saying employees want to have their cake and eat it too? They want a strong culture, and they also want to be flexible and work from wherever, isn’t that oxymoronic?” I say, “No. If you’re dependent on being in person for your culture, because you think people need to see the posters in the elevators or see people in the water cooler area, then it’s lazy and it’s marketing, not a culture.”', 'Culture is how we interact with each other on a daily basis. It’s how our managers lead. It’s how our individuals and colleagues look out for one another. That’s the core of culture, and you can do that virtually, or you can do that in person. You just have to make the effort and invest in it and prioritize it.', 'There are two longer-term plays as well. When I think about the longer-term plays, I think one of them is, how do you reduce your demand for employees? How do you change the work you’re doing in a way that means you don’t need as many employees as you did previously? You have to rethink how you work. You have to look at some of the gains made over the course of the pandemic in terms of automation, in terms of use of things like the virtual check-in process when you go to a doctor’s appointment or the QR menus you see at restaurants that have started to be used more widely.', 'The fourth one is, how do you increase the supply of workers for the long term? How are you getting the next generation excited about your industry? How are you partnering with schools, vocational programs, universities, colleges to offer the scholarships, to offer the flexible work schedules to attract them?', 'All of those pieces are going to be really important to get people interested. It’s those four pieces—the two that are immediate around attracting and retaining what is available, and the two that are longer term, which are about reducing your actual demand as well as increasing the supply.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Bonnie, I know I’ve learned a lot about where I fall into these personas and learned a lot about what companies can do to combat the Great Attrition. Thank you for taking the time and joining us today.', 'Bonnie Dowling: Absolutely. It was wonderful, a real treat.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Maybe another way to combat the Great Attrition is to have more fun at work. Is it possible? Let’s take a listen to Catherine Price, author of Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again, a book that was featured in our Author Talks series, who says fun should be a priority, not an afterthought.', 'Catherine Price: At first glance, it might seem like the absolute worst time to be talking about a book about fun, given that we’re in year three of a global pandemic, and many people are feeling like fun is the last thing they could devote attention to. But what I’ve come to realize is that the opposite is true. Fun can boost our resilience and our spirits in a way that makes it easier for us to cope with whatever life may throw at us. We need to rethink how we think about fun: less as a treat we get to have only if everything’s already going great and more as a tool we can tap into to help ourselves weather the challenges life may present us with.', 'One of the more interesting things I stumbled upon when I was trying to write a book about fun is that there’s not a very good definition of what fun truly is. I came up with the idea that fun, or as I call it “true fun,” is the confluence of three psychological states: playfulness, connection, and flow.', 'Playfulness means you’re doing things just for the sake of doing them, and you’re not caring too much about the outcome. Connection is a fundamental element of fun because in the vast majority of situations or anecdotes people have shared with me, another person or another creature is involved. There are also cases in which you can be truly connected to an activity or to your authentic self or to your body. But often there’s a person involved, even for introverts. Flow is the psychological state in which you get so absorbed in your present experience you lose track of time, like an athlete in the midst of a game or a musician playing a piece of music or when you’re in the middle of a really engaging conversation.', 'Making a point of noticing moments of playfulness, noticing moments of connection and noticing moments of flow can go a long way in helping us benefit psychologically from the moments of fun that we are already experiencing. We are constantly on high alert, but that’s very stressful and anxiety producing. One of my hopes for the book, in addition to it being a fun read, is to help us shift away from our natural tendency to focus on the negative and begin to appreciate some of the positive stuff that happens all the time, even in difficult times.', 'It can be a real challenge to try to fabricate fun, especially in a group workplace setting. I’m not going to claim to have the perfect answer to that, because I do think fun is much like romance: if you try to force it too much, it’s not going to happen. What you can do, though, is set the stage for it.', 'Fun is much like romance: if you try to force it too much, it’s not going to happen. What you can do, though, is set the stage for it.', 'If you’re in a leadership role, one thing that’s conducive to fun is to allow your humanity to show. Anyone in a leadership position who’s able to make a joke at their own expense or have a more lighthearted, less professional, less jargony attitude, that’s going to help.', 'Bonnie Dowling is an associate partner in McKinsey’s Denver office.

In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partner Kersten Heineke speaks with global editorial director Lucia Rahilly about micromobility: who’s using it, why it’s becoming more popular, and how cities can adapt to a future of tiny transportation.', 'Following their conversation, we hear from NYU associate professor of psychology Tessa West about toxic coworkers. In her book, Jerks at Work: Toxic Coworkers and What to Do About Them (Portfolio, January 2022), featured in a recent edition of our Author Talks series, West describes how to handle jerks at work–and how not to become one yourself.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Kersten, I will confess I was a micromobility skeptic for several years. I live in New York City, and, lo, these many years later, my family takes tremendous delight in pointing out not just the profusion of bicycles on our local streets but also now all these e-bikes, scooters, delivery mopeds, and so forth. You are based in Germany, in our Frankfurt office. Have you seen a similar trajectory locally over time?', 'Kersten Heineke: We are definitely seeing a similar trajectory. Especially with COVID-19, we’ve seen the number of bikes on the street increase massively. At McKinsey’s office building here in Frankfurt, they actually had to take away parking spots for cars because they couldn’t fit all the bikes anymore. This happened post-COVID-19, even with people not going into the office that frequently. There’s definitely a massive increase in micromobility usage, in micromobility ownership, and in micromobility that is shared.', 'We see lots of bikes, and lots of e-bikes. We also see cargo bikes, where people put their kids either in the front or in the back, depending on the model, or they put something else in. We also see vehicles that look completely different and that are something between a car and a bike. We’re going to see more and more of these vehicles on the road.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’re seeing all this evidence of micromobility in our day-to-day life in various forms. You colead McKinsey’s Center for Future Mobility, and you’ve been studying this kind of disruption for some time. What does the actual research tell us about attitudes toward micromobility at this juncture?', 'Kersten Heineke: We are seeing a couple of trends now. One is that micromobility is the only thing that’s up in usage post-COVID-19. Public transit is still down versus pre-COVID-19 levels. Car sharing, e-hailing, ride hailing, and so on are on the same level, maybe a bit up.', 'People want fresh air. The other reason for this increase is that, especially over here in Europe, cities invested heavily in bringing micromobility infrastructure—bike lanes, especially—to another level. It has gotten much, much more convenient, faster, but also much safer to use a bike to get from one location to another.', 'I’m personally one of those COVID-19 converts. I’ve been converted from going to work by car every single morning to going to work by e-kickscooter every single morning I go to the office. And it’s the best time of the day. It’s my 12 minutes of quiet time.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Say more about the use cases that prevail for micromobility. Do folks look at e-scooters and mopeds and the like as alternatives to cars?', 'Kersten Heineke: It really depends on the person. For most people, it is complementary, but it is replacing certain use cases. For some folks, it is replacing the morning commute. For many others, it is replacing trips once you are downtown or in the central business district and you need to go to different types of appointments.', 'The other trend we see is people tend to use different modes of micromobility or different form factors for different types of trips. The e-kickscooter is very popular for leisure trips, when you are a tourist in a city and you want to explore the city or when you want to go quickly from point A to point B; also at nighttime, or when you’re doing leisure trips other than tourism.', 'People tend to use different modes of micromobility or different form factors for different types of trips. The e-kickscooter is very popular for leisure trips. The moped is more for larger cities where you have longer distances.', 'The moped is more for larger cities where you have longer distances and need to get from A to B a bit more quickly. The bike is also very much used for commuting and shopping. In that case, it’s more of an ownership thing rather than a mobility-as-a-service or sharing thing.', 'Lucia Rahilly: In New York, we see lots of delivery happening on mopeds, particularly food delivery and so forth. It occurs to me that high-speed package delivery exists. It was on the upswing prepandemic and then seems to have spiked, at least in my building, during the pandemic. Do you see a future for micromobility related to that famously vexing challenge of last-mile delivery?', 'Kersten Heineke: Absolutely. I was at the Eurobike Convention, in Frankfurt, which is a trade fair that focuses exclusively on bikes and micromobility. I saw so many vehicles that are dedicated to last-mile logistics. Think of it like a bike that has four wheels. It has a huge cupboard at the end, a huge box at the back, where you can put in a significant amount of packages, where you can put in food and keep it warm, where you can put in groceries and keep them cool. We will see many, many form factors.', 'We will also see larger form factors. We will continue to see the person on a bike delivering only a small package or delivering food with a traditional vehicle. But we will see these form factors move into accommodating the requirements of people who deliver different types of goods.', 'Yes, the future of last mile has a significant component of these tinier vehicles to it, especially for anything that needs to be express delivered or where there’s a certain willingness of people to pay for that delivery. Will it be cost competitive with delivering packages via a van or via a small truck? Probably not, because those are extremely competitive when it comes to cost per package and TCO [total cost of ownership].', 'Lucia Rahilly: Some countries must be further ahead on micromobility than others. I’m thinking of cities like Amsterdam, for example, which is famous for its bicycles—early micromobility. How does uptake of these various micromobility vehicles vary by geography?', 'Kersten Heineke: We have a couple of countries, like you were saying, and a couple of cities where there are a lot of different types of micromobility. Southern Europe, historically, has had a very high share of mopeds.', 'Countries like the Netherlands—with Amsterdam being in the lead—also the Nordics—Copenhagen is a good example—have a long tradition of bicycles. China has a huge tradition of bicycles and other types of vehicles. There are lots of motorized two-wheelers and three-wheelers when it comes to Southeast Asia or India.', 'The US is probably one of the developed nations that is a bit further behind when it comes to micromobility usage, simply because the distances are larger. A car is very convenient. Quite frankly, especially outside of cities like New York City, the infrastructure isn’t necessarily up to taking safe rides with a bike or with a micromobility vehicle.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk about the infrastructure investment that is necessary. What are some examples of the changes cities might have to make in order to enable uptake of this kind of alternative?', 'Kersten Heineke: The most basic one is to replace car lanes with bike lanes and to make sure that the bike lanes that are being built replace a proper car lane, so that two bikes can safely overtake each other. Ideally, these bike lanes should be somewhat separated from car traffic. That’s the most basic thing cities can do.', 'The next level is adding bike lanes systematically and thinking about how people actually travel from one point to another. Making sure that this entire journey is covered with proper bike lanes makes a huge difference.', 'The other big piece is proper parking. I posted a picture on LinkedIn the other week with the scooters parked in front of our office. I didn’t mean any harm by it. I just said, “Look at all these scooters. Look at all these people that came by scooter. They saved so much CO2. They saved so much space.” But the entire discussion on LinkedIn exploded around people saying, “But it looks ugly. They should be parked in a more proper way. We need docking stations,” and so on.', 'I agree. There is a point to be made that these vehicles can be parked in a more orderly fashion. Cities can also do something about designating certain areas for proper parking.', 'Lucia Rahilly: In the US, at least, we see so much of a trend toward macro versus micro. There’s an explosion of SUVs and other big cars for convenience reasons. How does the safety data play out?', 'Kersten Heineke: What we’ve seen in the data is it’s OK. Of course, the number of accidents with micromobility has gone up over the last years. Why? Because, A, there was more movement post-COVID-19. B, there’s more micromobility. And, C, there are some new form factors that didn’t exist before.', 'So, obviously, the number of accidents with e-kickscooters went up in 2022 over 2021. It’s probably going to go up again in 2023 simply because this is a growing industry. More people are using the vehicles and so on.', 'You do see some differences between the form factors. I saw in a report that the vehicle with the highest number of accidents is an e-bike. That’s not necessarily because of the e-bike as a form factor but because the e-bike has a bias toward a certain age group and ridership where there seems to be a bit higher propensity for accidents.', 'Lucia Rahilly: You raised an interesting point on demographics. What are the demographics for micromobility users?', 'Kersten Heineke: There is a bias toward people under the age of 49. There is also a bias toward men, especially for e-kickscooters.', 'The other piece is we do see few elderly riders, especially when it comes to shared micromobility. When we look at e-cargo bikes, we see very high adoption among young families, simply because this is sort of the perfect use case, where you can put your young kids in an urban environment. Definitely a bias toward younger people, below 30 or below 25.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk about some of the implications of your research. There are various stakeholders, I would imagine.', 'Kersten Heineke: The basic message is the micromobility market is growing, and it’s growing everywhere. When I say everywhere, I mean geographically, but I also mean all the different segments: sharing, subscription, ownership.', 'The other piece is when you look at cities, we do believe the shared micromobility market—doesn’t matter which form factor—is here to stay and will grow sizably. The key question for players now is how can they make it profitable? How can it become a permanent part of daily city life when we talk about shared micromobility?', 'When we talk about personal ownership of vehicles, one of the biggest trends is going to be subscription. The other trend is offering people a portfolio of micromobility vehicles that they can then subscribe to or even own—because we believe that there isn’t a single micromobility vehicle that can truly replace a car. If you truly want to get rid of your car and live micromobility only, or micromobility plus car sharing if you’ll do a trip outside the city, it’s going to be a combination of form factors.', 'When we talk about personal ownership of vehicles, one of the biggest trends is going to be subscription. The other trend is offering people a portfolio of micromobility vehicles that they can then subscribe to or even own.', 'It’s going to be interesting to see which players will offer these types of combinations first, with the possibility to have an e-bike, a cargo bike, maybe a scooter for certain trips, and then maybe something else entirely that’s even larger at home in a clever model. And then to see how consumers will own the e-vehicle. Will it be subscription based? Financed? Ownership of parts of it?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Earlier in this conversation, you alluded to a vehicle that sounded something like a microcar. I was imagining, for example, as anyone who has been to India has seen, those auto-rickshaws. Or in Southern Europe, as you alluded to, there are tiny, tiny cars—those little smart cars and so forth. What is a microcar? Do you expect them to catch on in places like the United States?', 'Kersten Heineke: There will be a form factor, somewhere between a bike and a car, that’s going to catch on. But it’s going to look different in Europe versus the US and other geographies. In Europe, we’re going to see three-wheeler bikes, four-wheeler bikes, it will give you a certain protection from the weather by having a protective shell around it, by having a proper windscreen.', 'They will also have a seat for the driver and then maybe two smaller seats for children in the back. They might also give you a chance to, in a modular fashion, take out the seats and put in something where you can store cargo, so that you can take a suitcase, or you can also take your groceries, and so on. People are going to be allowed to ride them in bike lanes to a certain extent, but they’re going to be much closer to a bike than they would be to a car.', 'We’ll also see the microcar. Think of it like a smart car but even smaller. These vehicles already exist today. When we think about a city like New York, then, yes—these smaller vehicles are going to catch on there, too. We’re going to see these larger bikes, or the microcars, in other very dense cities in the US.', 'We’ll also see the microcar. Think of it like a smart car but even smaller. These vehicles already exist today. When we think about a city like New York, then, yes—these smaller vehicles are going to catch on there, too.', 'I don’t think we’re going to see many of these vehicles in the cities that are a bit more spread out, which I would assume is 90 percent of the US cities, maybe even more. Same goes for the US and European countryside.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve heard so much about self-driving cars. What is the trajectory for self-driving e-scooters or e-bikes? Will that be a dominating concept?', 'Kersten Heineke: I have my doubts, because the cost, in terms of the sensors you need to put on them, is super high. The use case of repositioning these by being autonomous is fairly limited. So while we will see autonomous cars and other types of autonomous vehicles quite short term, I doubt that we are going to see a significant number of autonomous bikes or scooters or other micromobility vehicles.', 'Lucia Rahilly: You have spent a lot of time researching mobility disruptions. When you project forward to 2030, what do you think the transportation landscape might look like? How might my local street look different?', 'Kersten Heineke: I’ll give you the version of 2030 for the most progressive cities. That might be 2035 for some of the less progressive cities. If you imagine a city today and a street today that has four lanes—two lanes going in each direction and one row of parking on either side and maybe a small curb and maybe a bike lane—I think what will change is we’re going to see a complete shift in how the space is utilized.', 'I imagine two lanes in the center of the road for vehicles—maybe private vehicles, but in many cases only shared autonomous vehicles. Then we will see a very wide lane for micromobility vehicles, including the goods-delivery micromobility vehicles.', 'This will ultimately still leave a massive amount of space for other things. We’re not going to need parking anymore, because you’re not going to be allowed to have a personal vehicle, at least in highly urban environments. We’re freeing up a lot of space that we can use for all the other things, like micromobility and autonomous vehicles. We can also use it to put in more parks, put in more cafés.', 'That’s the future. That’s going to happen because, ultimately, we need to get away from personal mobility. We need to get away from cars—at least, in urban environments—because they congest a lot, they emit a lot. And it’s by far not the most efficient way of transport.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve also seen converging stressors on cars lately—not just rising gas prices but semiconductor chip shortages—that have affected the availability of cars and so forth. Do you imagine any of that will accelerate the uptake of micromobility options?', 'Kersten Heineke: Yes. There is a combination of multiple factors. One is it’s harder to get a car. People are keeping their cars longer. It’s also harder to use cars because, obviously, gas is more expensive. We’re going to electric vehicles to a certain extent.', 'We’re going to see city tolls and bans for cars. There isn’t this massive single inflection point where ten cities in a country will say, “We’re going to ban cars.” I don’t see that happening.', 'This gradual shift has already started to happen. And COVID-19 was only an acceleration for it. Making the move toward, let’s say, fewer miles in cars, and therefore more micromobility, more other means of transport—this is going to continue to happen.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Kersten, this was such a fascinating discussion. Lots of fun. Thanks so much for joining us today.', 'Kersten Heineke: Thanks so much for having me. Loved the discussion.', 'Roberta Fusaro: While micromobility makes some lives a lot easier, I think we can all agree that toxic coworkers can make our lives a whole lot harder. So now let’s hear from Tessa West, author of Jerks at Work.', 'Tessa West: The C-suite is the place where, if there’s going to be a cultural contagion of jerks, that’s where it happens.', 'The workplace has changed a lot now. If the C-suite is behaving one way, even if it doesn’t directly affect you as an employee because you never interact with that C-suite, you’re very intolerant of working for a company that embraces this behavior culturally. The C-suite is in a prime place to turn that jerk behavior on or off because they decide whether that company is going to be a breeding ground for jerk behavior.', 'One thing that we’ve learned during the pandemic is that we feel like we can avoid the people that are difficult to work with much more, but the reality is they’re just as effective at destroying our well-being and our productivity at work as they were before. When we’re not interacting with each other, having casual conversations, walking to the coffee shop, stopping by the office of our neighbor, we’re not getting all the information that we used to get that signals who is difficult to work with and what the strategies are for dealing with it. Each type of jerk that I talk about in my book has one set of skills and another set of weaknesses, and you need to understand both in order to develop strategies for coping with them.', 'The only real way of solving for jerks at work is to have allies. Think about someone you work with who you’re not best friends with. You’re not that close, but what they have is knowledge about the workplace and a lot of social connections that you don’t have. So the best allies can help you expand your social network and introduce you to other potential targets of your jerk at work, or other people who can pull levers of power to help you understand what it will take to convince your boss to care about your jerk at work.', 'One of the biggest misconceptions we have about thinking about jerks at work is that they don’t have any social skills, that they can’t read a room, that they aren’t paying attention to how other people are supposed to be treating them, and these kinds of things. But the reality is that most jerks at work have incredible social skills.', 'One of the biggest misconceptions we have about thinking about jerks at work is that they don’t have any social skills, that they can’t read a room. But the reality is that most jerks at work have incredible social skills.', 'For example, think about the “free rider.” They tend to be very charismatic. They utilize their social skills to get ahead. The same is true for someone like the “kiss up, kick downer.” They know exactly the right ways of complimenting you behind your back so that the boss won’t suspect them.', 'Another misconception is that they know how their behavior makes other people feel. Most of us assume that if we’re dealing with a jerk at work, this person is doing this intentionally, and they know it makes other people feel bad. But the reality is almost no one gives negative feedback at work.', 'It’s nonnormative to give people negative feedback. We feel uncomfortable doing it, and so we often avoid it. But we assume these individuals know how their behavior is affecting others, even though they rarely do.', 'The last misconception about jerks at work is that they enjoy doing what they’re doing. Most of the time, the behavior that jerks are engaging in that harms you also harms them. It doesn’t help them to behave this way. But they’re doing it for lots of reasons, ranging from having poor management skills to doing whatever it takes to get ahead, or maybe that’s just the culture of the company.', 'Why is it important for us to consider whether we are the jerk? Most of us are a combination of good and bad. We can be amazing at work. We can be difficult at work. It’s important to think about how you behave when you’re at your absolute worst: when you’re sleep deprived or you don’t have resources. We all have the potential to be someone who’s not ideal—a micromanager, a neglectful boss, a credit stealer, a freeloader—when we get overwhelmed.', 'Half the battle in dealing with jerks at work is detecting your own inner jerk and not just stopping that behavior but looking at what the behaviors are that precede it: What is it that really turns you into that less ideal version of yourself? And then develop strategies for what you’re going to do instead. As we go through this process of cleaning out our jerks at work, we also have to admit to ourselves when we are contributing to the problem.', 'Kersten Heineke is a partner in McKinsey’s Frankfurt office.

In this episode, we also hear from McKinsey senior partner Robert Palter, featured in our My Rookie Moment series, about the valuable lesson he learned from his boss when confronted with a difficult client.', 'This transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: When I think of apprenticeship, I think of my uncle in Italy who apprenticed with a tailor and then opened his own shop. How do both of you define apprenticeship?', 'Lisa Christensen: When I think of apprenticeship, I think about a teacher–learner relationship that happens in the flow of work. There is somebody who has skills who is teaching someone else those skills, helping that person move toward greater independence.', 'We know apprenticeship is working when somebody is able to start doing things more and more independently. Apprenticeship is an opportunity to transfer expertise from someone who knows how to do something to someone who is just learning.', 'Tony Gambell: A lot of the concepts of apprenticeship are unchanged and are around skill transfer from an expert to a novice. The biggest realization that we’re finding these days is that in the world of knowledge working, or in a place expertise is cognitive as opposed to physical, we have to think about apprenticeship differently. We have to act differently and speak differently and use a different skill set to be able to transfer knowledge and skills more efficiently.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How does apprenticeship differ from other teaching and learning models that folks in businesses today are more familiar with, like mentorship, sponsorship, or coaching?', 'Lisa Christensen: Mentorship is important, because from mentors you get advice and direction. They can help you think about what you should be doing. From sponsors, you get real opportunities. They can create new opportunities for you to lead or work in different ways that you have not before.', 'From an apprenticeship relationship, you get skills. We do think there are differences between those three kinds of relationships. All are important, but apprenticeship comes with a set of techniques that you can use as an expert to grow skills in the people around you, techniques that are different than just giving them advice or even trying to create opportunities for them. There are some really specific things that help grow skills in other people.', 'Tony Gambell: Something I’ve come to really believe is that apprenticeship is not a selective commitment. As leaders, we have a responsibility to grow the skills of the people in our organizations. Whereas you might choose a mentor or choose a mentee—and likewise with sponsorship—apprenticeship is a commitment, an obligation, that we should all embrace.', 'Lisa Christensen: Tony, I’ve heard you say something before that’s really interesting, which I wrote down and I think about in my regular work: when someone’s on my watch, my job is to help make them better. My job is to look around me and say, “What skills do I possess, and how can I help transfer those to other people?” I love the idea that this is an obligation for leaders and something that we should all be doing.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What skills are required for an apprenticeship relationship to succeed?', 'Lisa Christensen: The research tells us there are four techniques that make up the skill set of apprenticeship: modeling, scaffolding, coaching, and fading. At a high level, here’s what those things mean. Modeling is my ability to show you what I know and help you understand the rationale behind it.', 'Scaffolding is the support that I create around you. That can look like anything. That could be a document that I give you. That could be a YouTube video I send you to look at. That could be me talking to you or coaching you in a situation. I provide support to help you do the work.', 'Coaching is the feedback, the pointers, the tips, the things that I do to help you as you are doing the work. So you do it, and I give you lots of rich feedback so that you can get better at it.', 'Fading is knowing when to pull back. As you start to get better and better, I am able to remove some of the training wheels that I’m providing for you, and you’re able to act with increasing independence.', 'Tony Gambell: One of the biggest insights for me around apprenticeship is the notion of scaffolding. Scaffolding is a method or a language that makes your invisible insights visible.', 'There was a time when I had to visit four factories in a week, and there was no way I could physically do it. Some of my colleagues had to go look at the other factories while I was looking at one or two of them.', 'I created a template for how I look at factories: here are the questions that I ask, here are the things I look for, and here is the output that I typically present after doing a one-day factory walk-through. I found it was quite effective to not only get to a good output for my clients, but it also upskilled the people that I was working with on how I think about factory walk-throughs. And in doing so, I was scaffolding.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Does apprenticeship have to be top down? Or can it go the other way?', 'Lisa Christensen: It should go both ways. One of the core tenets of apprenticeship is that it is nonhierarchical. It doesn’t have to be a senior person apprenticing a junior person.', 'That certainly happens, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The person who has the skills should embrace the responsibility, the obligation, and the opportunity of helping other people get the same skills they have.', 'Tony Gambell: As the problems we’re solving in the world become more and more complex, it’s really valuable to have diversity in problem solving and different perspectives. So oftentimes, even just the interaction of people of different tenures, backgrounds, or expertise really does help you get to a better answer. And oftentimes, the most amazing insight will come from a pair of fresh eyes, someone who is brand new to the organization and who has a different way of looking at things.', 'Roberta Fusaro: This calls to mind the notion of multigenerational workforces. Is there a generational component to apprenticeship that leaders need to think about if they’re trying to build more apprenticing into their organization?', 'Lisa Christensen: One thing does come to mind, which is that we live in an era where information is much more accessible than it has ever been before. I am not as dependent on the people around me to teach me. I can learn in lots of different ways.', 'In the work I do in the field of learning, for a long time there’s been this concern about how to get the younger generations to stop searching for answers and come to us instead. I think that’s the wrong way to look at it. If people are googling or watching YouTube videos for great information, wherever they’re finding it, how do we start to think about also bringing experts and expertise and apprenticeship into that ecosystem so that people aren’t out searching on their own, but that it’s part of a full experience that they’re getting? They’re getting information from wherever they find it, but they are also learning from experts and people who do something really well.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are some of the obstacles to engaging in apprenticeship models in organizations today?', 'Tony Gambell: One of the most important unlocks is the mindset of intentionality.', 'This became really clear to me last year when we were piloting concepts of cognitive apprenticeship with about 180 of our colleagues globally. After three months, we found that 80 percent of participants experienced better apprenticeship relationships.', 'Lisa Christensen: When I think about intentionality, it’s acting with purpose. The things I do, the choices I make, the ways that I interact with you—I’m making those choices quite purposefully. For example, maybe you get a deliverable, and it’s not what you want it to be, you change it and make it right.', 'Nobody can learn anything from that, but if you sit with somebody and you say, “Here are the ten comments that I made on this deliverable. Let’s talk through them. Let’s go into this thing that I need you to do differently. Let’s talk about why this matters.”', 'The deliverable is going to get produced one way or another. If you start to model the thinking, it can become a tool for learning—or it could be a missed opportunity. So for me, part of what we’re describing is intentionality: making purposeful choices about using the work to further other people’s skills.', 'Roberta Fusaro: When you talk about better apprenticeship, what are some of the discrete outcomes and metrics you use? Is it about the nature of the relationships or the nature of the outcomes or the deliverables?', 'Tony Gambell: At the end of the day, it comes down to growth and learning. I’ll highlight one insight that I think is the real unlock, and that is the idea in cognitive apprenticeship that the insights are invisible. They’re in your head. An expert has a mental model on how they see the world, and a novice or a learner is trying to learn that mental model.', 'To me, the metric of success is the extent to which the learner has adopted that new mental model. Not that they’ve reflected feedback. Not that they’ve changed something in an output of work. But that they’ve changed their mental model so that when they see a situation later, independent of the expert, they will be better skilled and better able to address that same situation.', 'Lisa Christensen: I like that idea of invisible insights. I think that’s critical to the work, because so much of the work that we do in our environments is not work that you can observe. Even what we’re doing right now. You might be able to observe us recording this podcast, but the actual work is happening in my mind.', 'So if I’m going to help other people grow their skills, I need to get a lot better at being able to give voice to that cognition. I have to be able to talk about my thinking. I have to be able to model it for other people. And it is through that modeling that I start to build their skills.', 'Work is so heavily cognitive: sitting in a meeting and managing stakeholders, thinking about how you build deliverables or what somebody will need to see in a presentation or hear in a conversation. That work is all deeply cognitive. You can’t see it. So the idea of embracing apprenticeship techniques that help you model those invisible insights is a really important differentiator in this work, and in the skills to becoming a great “apprentisor”—someone who apprentices others.', 'Tony Gambell: We’ve learned more and more that the deeper you are an expert in something, the harder it will be for you to explain your mental model. That’s made me think about expertise in a different way, and the value of an expert in an organization relative to the work that they’re doing.', 'That’s going to be one of the biggest organizational challenges we have in the future: finding ways to encourage and incentivize and help experts train communities of experts within companies so that their knowledge becomes institutional knowledge. The value of the expert is amazing, but that value is multiplied if they’re able to share their mental model with a whole community of people in their companies.', 'The value of the expert is amazing, but that value is multiplied if they’re able to share their mental model with a whole community of people in their companies.', 'Roberta Fusaro: We’re not always co-located, and as much as the information is in my brain, sometimes it’s easier if you and I are sitting side by side. How do we think about apprenticeship differently in today’s post-COVID-19, often-hybrid work environment?', 'Tony Gambell: A good question, Roberta, and one that we have been talking about a lot internally. Our research does tell us that apprenticeship has relied on informal collision moments in the past. Those are the unplanned moments when two coworkers collide, so to speak, or find time to connect, whether it’s following a meeting or over a cup of coffee.', 'Something like greater than 80 percent of apprenticeship was happening in these unplanned moments. But when you’re in a remote world, those physical collision moments just don’t happen. Which again brings me back to the point about intentionality—you can create those moments if you’re a bit more thoughtful about how you manage your calendar and find time to connect with people.', 'It’s also important for us to continue to look for ways to work collaboratively with people, even when in remote situations. The simple fact is that if you’re doing work together, you will learn from one another.', 'Lisa Christensen: One of the things that we are excited about is the idea that we might actually be able to start to get greater scale in an organization if people’s skills are stronger and they’re less dependent on those collision moments.', 'If that’s what you think apprenticeship is, if you think it’s the car ride to the airport or the walk back to your office after a meeting, then your view is limited in what you can do. You have to create some space in a remote environment that you wouldn’t otherwise have to create, but it’s really a lot more about skill and your ability to grow the skills of others than it is about a moment that happens.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Can you give us an example of how a manager and a team member can incorporate apprenticeship into their process?', 'Tony Gambell: Let’s take an example where a worker has sent a presentation or a document to a manager in preparation for a meeting the following day. As the manager, I’ll look at it and I may see that there are a lot of changes that need to be made.', 'In my haste, I may look at it and say, “I know exactly what needs to be done. I’m just going to make all the changes myself. I know what I’m looking for and I have the expertise and it will just take much less time.”', 'That’s a common practice, or perceived as a common practice, that taking the path of least resistance will get you to a good answer for the next day. However, what I will miss out on is the opportunity to apprentice the person on my team.', 'Alternatively, what I could do is pick up the phone and talk through the document with the person on my team, walking through all the changes that I was going to make myself individually, but do them with the coworker, explaining why along the way.', 'It’s also important to explain the why, which might be as simple as, “I prefer this word choice,” or “I prefer telling a story that’s more direct as opposed to indirect.” Or it might even be the formatting of the page.', 'In the end, if I’m going to do the work anyway, why not do the work in a way that develops a person on my team so that they will grow their skills independently? So the next time they send a document or prepare for the same sort of meeting, they’ve advanced their skills and they’re much more capable of doing what we’re looking for them to do.', 'If we’re deliberate and we take the time up front, it will save time. It will.', 'Lisa Christensen: It will. And that’s one of the biggest concerns that we hear in our work right now: “I don’t have time to do this.” It will pay off in the long run, both for you and for them.', 'Tony Gambell: Here’s one more example. In a remote world, I’m starting to see that a lot of us are doing our work independently and sequentially, as opposed to working together collaboratively.', 'So what I’ve started doing is, even in a remote-working world, if you’re going to have a one-on-one meeting with someone, invite someone from your team who can join the meeting, observe, listen, and apprentice with you. Even in those small instances, built up over time, your team will grow.', 'Lisa Christensen: It’s really about providing people exposure to lots of different situations in which they can practice—so that it’s not just theoretical, but it’s all of these instances where you’re actually doing work together.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I want to dive in on the actual apprenticeship relationship. Does enthusiasm matter more than experience when it comes to building a successful apprenticing relationship?', 'Lisa Christensen: I think it’s both, right? And I think it’s license and liberty to feel like you can grow other people’s skills and that you should be doing that.', 'There’s something implicit in this question about what if we teach somebody wrong. I understand that concern. But if apprenticeship is a rich environment inside an organization, I’m not learning from just Tony. I’m not learning from just you. I’m learning from everybody around me. And I’m not trying to create somebody who’s exactly like me. I’m trying to create really great designers or I’m trying to create really great leaders.', 'Tony Gambell: There’s an age-old debate about whether you hire for skill or hire for will. And I think you’re right—you’re looking for both. But at the end of the day, I am more and more convinced that you can hire for will and train for skill.', 'If someone has the enthusiasm to learn, and you as an organization have an enthusiasm to teach, then you have a commitment to each other that this is the type of formula that’s really going to be successful.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Lisa, you mentioned this notion that you don’t want to apprentice only people who are exactly like yourself. How do you avoid the mini-me bias?', 'Lisa Christensen: That’s a really important thing to think about. There is somebody on my team who I really enjoy working with. I really enjoy apprenticing him because he is exactly like me. He thinks the same way I think, and so those conversations just feel very easy and they gel.', 'However, part of my obligation as a leader is then to look around and say, “OK, I certainly should spend time with him, and work and help build his skills.', 'But I can’t only spend time with him. I have to find opportunities for everybody on the team. I have to try to build the skill set of everybody on the team.”', 'They don’t all need to be exactly like me. Trying to intentionally avoid that mini-me bias and having awareness that that’s a possibility is a really important first step.', 'Tony Gambell: Another bonus benefit that comes from avoiding the mini-me mindset is that sometimes the experts need a different point of view to continue learning themselves. Experts have blind spots too.', 'I’m a manufacturing expert, so I’ve been in over 200 factories. I credit myself for being able to read a factory pretty quickly. But a couple years ago, I brought along with me a colleague who really had no background in manufacturing but was super deep in corporate finance.', 'After we walked through the factory, we compared notes, and I shared the different levers that you could pull to improve the factory’s productivity and improve the throughput, improve the quality. And the colleague I was working with stopped and said, “I see you could do all those things, but I don’t think this factory’s making any money, nor do I think it’s structurally able to make any money.”', 'And he did the back-of-the-envelope math to show me. And he was right. The factory was structurally unprofitable. I didn’t have that lens to look at this. I was coming to it with my pattern recognition and my well-refined expert lens of “How do you fix a factory?” Having a diverse viewpoint creates another situation of learning for the expert as well.', 'In the end, not only did I, as a leader and expert, learn a new way to look at a problem, we actually solved the problem in a better way. We need to be open to the idea that as leaders, if we are open to different perspectives we will get to better answers.', 'Lisa Christensen: I like that so much, and it reinforces something that we keep saying but is really important: this has to become an ecosystem where everybody is learning and everybody is teaching, and we’re doing that all the time for one another.', 'Something we keep saying but is really important is that this has to become an ecosystem where everybody is learning and everybody is teaching, and we’re doing that all the time for one another.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Both sides of the apprenticeship relationship are going to have different work experiences, inputs, successes, and failures. How do we think about maintaining these relationships over time?', 'Lisa Christensen: One of the important techniques we’re teaching folks is the ability to fade: the ability to dial down their support as somebody’s skills increase. As you see somebody’s independence increasing—they’re doing the work on their own, they’re much more effective on their own—it’s OK to fade back.', 'An apprenticeship relationship might be for a season. It might be for a specific skill. It might be for a specific moment. Or it might last for a really long time. But the relationship is quite fluid, and as the expert, knowing how to dial up or down your support is an important part of the skill of apprenticing others.', 'Tony Gambell: If you’re talking about expertise apprenticeship, the arc of learning is much longer. It could be years or even decades. When you’re talking about expertise apprenticeship, then you have to be much more deliberate about who you’re choosing to learn from.', 'Lisa Christensen: That gives me one other thought that circles back to something we talked about at the beginning. Which is that there is a distinction between apprenticeship and mentorship. And some of those people might overlap for you.', 'It’s important to be explicit about the types of relationships you have with different people. You might stay connected to somebody for a really long time as a great mentor, and sometimes you’ll apprentice with them a little bit and sometimes you might apprentice less. Both of those things can be true in the same moment.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Lisa and Tony, how can organizations use apprenticeship to begin to reshape their cultures around this idea of continuous learning?', 'Lisa Christensen: There are a couple of important things. Creating an organizational expectation that everybody learns and everybody teaches is the first thing. And then the second thing is making sure that everybody has the skills to apprentice one another.', 'Tony Gambell: Let me pile on with two practices or habits that I think have made this come to life for me. First is about creating space for apprenticeship. That’s looking for windows of time throughout the day that you could stop and have moments of apprenticeship with people on your team. Or if you’re the learner, that you deliberately pause and ask someone why they acted the way they did, or if they can explain what they said and what was behind it.', 'The second thing is there’s a difference between giving feedback and giving development-oriented feedback. The difference just comes down to the words we use.', 'I can say, “Change these words,” or “Write this sentence instead.” But if I just pause for a moment and say, “Because this will get us to a better outcome,” or “Because the person you’re writing to is going to be sensitive about what you just wrote here, so we need to write it differently,” that explanation alone explains why I’m giving the feedback and is developmental in nature. And the person I’m talking to will be better for it going forward.', 'Roberta Fusaro: This has been a great conversation. I know I’ve learned a lot. Lisa, Tony, thank you for joining us today.', 'Tony Gambell: My pleasure, Roberta. It’s been great. Thanks so much.', 'Lisa Christensen: Yes, thank you for having us.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And now, let’s hear from senior partner Robert Palter, who, early in his career at McKinsey, learned a big lesson from his manager about how to handle a client who wouldn’t take no for an answer.', 'Robert Palter: The first time I had to have a difficult conversation with a client, I was leading this engagement where I was helping a client assess a potential acquisition. We’d been working confidentially with the CEO alone because it was a high-profile transaction. And after about five weeks, the team had come to view that this acquisition probably was not the smartest or most attractive investment for this client to do.', 'We took our analysis and wrote a very detailed memo with all the backup work. I sent it to the CEO and scheduled a meeting to brief him on our findings. In advance of the scheduled meeting, the CEO called my office, found my assistant, and said, “Wherever Rob Palter is, you find him and you tell him to come down to my office immediately. I need to speak to him.” As a young project leader, I was very nervous.', 'So I quickly hopped in a cab and ran down to the client’s office, and I walked into his office, and he said, “I received your memo. And I’ve received your analysis where you concluded that this was not an attractive transaction for us to do. I want you to know that I vehemently disagree with you and that you will change this memo. You will write a memo to me saying that McKinsey wholeheartedly supports this transaction and thinks that it’s an excellent thing for this organization to do. And if you do not write that memo, I won’t pay your fees.” I was petrified.', 'So I walked out of the CEO’s office and I called the senior partner who was working with me and I told him what had transpired. The senior partner looked at me and said, “Rob, do you believe in your analysis?” And I said, “Yes, absolutely. I believe in the analysis.” He said, “Rob, do you believe that it’s the wrong thing for this client to do?” And I said, “Yes, I do believe it’s the wrong thing for this client to do.” He said, “Great. Let’s get together tonight. Let’s spend an extra hour or two going through all the work to make sure that I agree and you agree and the entire team agrees. Let’s bring in somebody from outside our team to look at our work and see if they agree with our conclusions. If the conclusion is that we stand behind our work, then we stand behind our work.”', 'We went through every page as a team, every analysis, every model, read the memo, checked the conclusions. I said to the senior partner, “Well, what do we do about the threat about not paying our fees?” And he looked at me and he said, “We have a professional obligation to be objective and independent. And if we objectively and independently conclude that this is not the right thing for the client—which we do—then we need to stand behind our work and tell the client that. And if we remain with our fees unpaid, so be it.”', 'I called up the CEO the next day, and I said, “We’ve done a thorough review. We’re not changing our position. And if you choose not to pay us and you choose not to work with us again, so be it.” The CEO said, “That’s fine. We’re not working together again. And I’m not paying you.” And I said, “OK.” The CEO subsequently went on to do the transaction, and it did not work out well, and it ended that CEO’s career. We no longer work with that client, and unfortunately it didn’t work out for anyone, but at least we were objective and independent.', 'Lisa Christensen is director of learning in McKinsey’s Learning Design Center of Excellence and is based in McKinsey’s Bay Area office, Tony Gambell is a partner in the Chicago office, and Robert Palter is a senior partner in the Toronto office.

Here’s how to encourage your employees to try more new things.,"['McKinsey’s report on human capital highlights the importance of internal mobility in organizations. Here’s how to encourage your employees to try more new things.', 'Corporate attrition persists, but one way to win employees back is to develop their knowledge, attributes, experiences—in short, their human capital. But how? How can companies determine what’s best for employees? How much value can greater internal mobility among workers create? McKinsey partners Anu Madgavkar and Bill Schaninger, coauthors of the recent report Human capital at work: The value of experience, join McKinsey Global Publishing’s Lucia Rahilly on this episode of The McKinsey Podcast to answer these and other questions.', 'First up, though, McKinsey partner Josh Katz shares a quick update with McKinsey executive editor Roberta Fusaro on the status of global food inflation and its effects on business.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Josh, a few months ago, we talked about how the war in Ukraine was increasing the risk of a global food crisis. What’s the latest? Has that come to pass?', 'Josh Katz: We are still in the midst of a food crisis that will have multiyear implications. We need to be aware of that. That being said, from where we were a few months ago to where we are today, some of the indicators have gotten better. Specifically, this has shown up in grain prices, which signals how dire the situation potentially is and how short we might be.', 'Back in February, there was a point when wheat prices were up about 60 percent. Now they’ve come down to about 20 percent, up from where they were in February. Corn prices were up about 30 percent at one point. And now they’re up about 20 percent. That’s not to say we’re out of the woods by any means, but it is a more positive outlook on where food prices have landed and therefore on how many people will be able to afford their food.', 'I’m still quite concerned about where we’ll be in the next several months, especially for countries that are reliant on food aid or for countries where many millions of people are going to face a financial crisis caused by the rise in food prices. That is absolutely still ahead of us. It is absolutely still ahead of us that farming is going to be challenged in parts of the world for the next several years, particularly as input prices are likely to remain high.', 'Let’s also remember that the inflation issue certainly predated the war in Ukraine. I just looked at the US food inflation numbers the other day: we were up in Q3 and Q4 of last year quite significantly in the food and beverage categories. That inflation did accelerate through the crisis, but we were already at levels that we hadn’t seen in about a decade in those quarters.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What do we know about how the trend is unfolding globally?', 'Josh Katz: Unfortunately, in the countries that are already feeling food crises, the war in Ukraine exacerbates them. It’s an affordability issue. In poorer countries, more of the wallet and the income that folks earn goes into food. So when food prices go up significantly, it’s an even bigger squeeze on them than it would be otherwise.', 'That’s not to say that this won’t be challenging for many across the globe, but I think that on a sheer numbers basis, and the extremes of the pain that is being felt, this will unfortunately fall disproportionately on countries where a significant amount of the population is already struggling.', 'In Ukraine, there are estimates that point to something like eight million acres of arable land has been lost through the conflict and potentially more because of shells that remain in fields. This means we’ll have a shortage of what comes from Ukraine in the next few years.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How can leaders respond, or how are they already responding to these shocks?', 'Josh Katz: In the very short term, we need to make sure that the harvested grain can get to market. That means finding creative ways to make sure that the grain that’s in Ukraine can get out. We’re seeing remarkable progress on that despite the ports being quite restricted. I think some of the reasons why the crop prices have come down have been due to the creativity of people for getting the grain out of the country.', 'Another strategy to help in the short term has involved several countries: about 20 so far have imposed some form of trade or export restrictions, which takes some flexibility out of the system. In the short term, those restrictions add challenges to moving grain around the world as we need to, so we’ll see if some of those come off to help the system more broadly.', 'As we look past this season, what we are going to have to figure out is how to make up for what’s missing from a more average production in Ukraine. We should recognize that the agriculture system is quite impressive in that, almost every year, there’s some form of a shock to that system. It’s a drought in one place. It’s another challenge to production in a different place. The system itself has historically become better at managing the fact that there are parts of the world that have challenges, and, frankly, trade has been a big part of that.', 'There are some concrete measures that we can look at in the medium term and questions we should ask ourselves: Are we incentivizing the planting of the right crops and food stuff crops? How are we actually using our conservation programs? How are we thinking about biofuels as part of the agricultural system?', 'Roberta Fusaro: In the long term, what kind of resiliencies are we looking at?', 'Josh Katz: We have an opportunity to look for productivity in an even broader set of crops. If we think about adding resilience to the system or just adding supply, having better varieties and better technologies across a broad set of crops, including wheat, would make a significant difference here.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How hard is it to get people to move away from this small set of crops or the parameters that they’re working under now?', 'Josh Katz: People have been looking at technologies that apply broadly across crops more easily or other soil amendments, which almost inherently helps add potential to other crops.', 'It is happening naturally, and the nature of the technologies that are on the horizon just need to be commercialized to help with that. I’m optimistic about where we are going.', 'It will also take farmer education and farmer incentives, because farmers are the best in the world at managing their land and their balance sheet. So asking them to do something differently is a very high bar. If you’re essentially betting your income every year on how you farm and what you farm, you would certainly want to be very convinced that what you’re being asked to do differently is going to work. And I think part of the challenge is that these are slow-moving changes, and there are good reasons as to why they can be slow moving.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So will the farming industry need to pull in nontraditional sources of talent?', 'Josh Katz: In the developing world, it’s unclear how folks will view the opportunity on the farm versus in urban areas. On the one hand, on the farm is becoming increasingly exciting as technology and opportunity expands because of connectivity.', 'On the other hand, we’re still at a point in most of the developing world where urbanization is a primary driver of where people choose to live and where they choose to work. So we’ll have that tension to sort through.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thinking about the next potential crisis, how can stakeholders be better prepared?', 'Josh Katz: There are a number of inherent challenges in the agricultural system to creating resiliency. While I think we’ve addressed many of them, the system will continue to evolve.', 'First of all, a number of our key inputs, as we’ve learned in this crisis, are concentrated in a few places around the world. In this case, it’s a potash question more than anything else. We have to recognize that and know how we can manage it.', 'We have also moved toward relatively concentrated production of certain grain. In the case of the war in Ukraine, the scramble has been around sunflower and wheat.', 'The other is, as you get further down the value chain and as we get into processing, there are elements that are relatively concentrated. People probably don’t consider the baby food crisis part of an agricultural element, but I think it’s a decent analogy here. We had one plant go down, which caused an entire crisis across the United States. So there are vulnerabilities associated with the concentration at certain steps of the value chain.', 'And then the other thing, which we haven’t talked about, is the twin climate and nature crises. We are going to see more frequent droughts in many parts of the world. We’re going to face risks from biodiversity or water shortages. I’m not sure we’ve fully recognized how severe those are. That means that the overall system has to be more resilient because we’re going to face different types of crises with more frequency.', 'Roberta Fusaro: You’ve listed a number of challenges. What can key stakeholders do next? What do leaders need to do next?', 'Josh Katz: First, I’m optimistic about the innovation that’s coming to this space and has been for the last several years. We’ve moved from a relatively small set of incredible innovators to a relatively broad set of incredible innovators that bring ideas from a whole host of industries to agriculture, which has been very exciting. I think the net result of that is we’ll become less reliant on a particular region or a particular type of input or a particular crop, or even a particular protein source.', 'We have so much innovation occurring that as it improves productivity, improves diversity, and allows us to grow food in different ways, it will help us quite a bit. A more resilient system should also have a longer-term view of our soil and our water and our land that we’re utilizing to produce the grain.', 'Part of that resilience is going to be investing in ensuring we have healthy soil, sufficient water, and sufficient biodiversity such that we are not trying to correct immediate problems, but we’ve built up an agricultural balance sheet of the planet that works well for us for the next several generations.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Bill, your research grapples with human capital, which, as a term, can risk feeling a bit mechanical and dehumanizing. What is at the heart of human capital?', 'Bill Schaninger: Human capital encompasses a person’s knowledge, skills, attributes, experiences, and health. Typically, health is not included in the definition of human capital. However, we added it to ours because we were looking at it across multiple countries and a broad range of people. We thought it was important to ask, “Are you healthy enough to deliver on your knowledge, skills, attributes, and experiences?”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Anu, human capital must be a tremendous source of value, not just for organizations and for economies, but for individuals. What did the research reveal about how we as individuals accumulate human capital throughout our working lives?', 'Anu Madgavkar: Human capital is essentially the potential of human beings to be productive. We found that this process of accumulation happens throughout life, and starts in early childhood. People accumulate a large amount of human capital abilities through education, but then through work experience, people learn to do new things, so they continue to accumulate human capital: they acquire new skills and find new ways to deploy those skills.', 'Almost half of a worker’s lifetime earnings are attributable to the skills that they acquire through work experience. Therefore, human capital is intimately connected with the whole experience of being in the workforce and working with other people.', 'One of the most surprising findings was that human capital is closely related to change, dynamism, and mobility, moving to new roles, performing new tasks, and learning new skills.', 'Almost half of a worker’s lifetime earnings are attributable to the skills that they acquire through work experience.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Right now we are in the throes of a very tight labor market, very high churn, as we know from McKinsey’s Great Attrition/Great Attraction research, as well as BLS [US Bureau of Labor Statistics] data and other stats. Did we learn anything new or surprising in this research about why folks are changing jobs?', 'Anu Madgavkar: We found that change is a feature of the labor market that precedes the Great Resignation. The Great Resignation highlights this process. But when we looked at the work histories of roughly four million workers across multiple countries, we found that, on average, people change their roles every two to four years.', 'Of those role moves, 80 percent are between organizations, meaning that people leave their current organization and move to somewhere else. And that’s because in the process of change, people find that they can perform new roles and learn new skills.', 'Our research around the Great Attrition/Great Attraction suggests that career development is an important, but less-well-understood, motivation for why people are quitting even now. They do want to advance.', 'Bill Schaninger: Companies can create new opportunities and new roles just by asking, “OK, what adjacent skills does the person have?”', 'The essence of this question is that some company is going to take advantage of the existing skills the person has, knowing the skills can be grown over time through experience. Why wouldn’t the organization that currently has them as an employee be looking to grow their skills?', 'This ties in with the Great Attrition/Great Attraction because there’s a real opportunity for organizations to say, “We want to be an academy company. We want you to continue acquiring and growing new skills.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: So gaining work experience is instrumental to growing our human capital, and mobility is vital to gaining work experience. What do we know about the folks who are changing jobs in the ways that most positively affect their human capital?', 'Anu Madgavkar: We found that roughly a third of workers in most of the countries we looked at had very successful, upwardly mobile career trajectories—one, two, or three income brackets higher.', 'Those who were upwardly mobile had pursued mobility, but with stretch roles and stretch skills, meaning they moved into jobs and roles that were adjacent, but still represented maybe up to 40 percent nonoverlapping new and different skills that they hadn’t deployed or exercised in their previous role.', 'We call that “boldness of moves.” And it’s the boldness of role moves that’s a really important part of the story of possibility. It’s important to enable more workers to break out of what they might have thought was their destiny simply because of the level of education that they had. It doesn’t have to be the case. You can defy the odds if you yourself, as well as your employer, encourage you to make those bold moves.', 'The cohorts who leave that for later or don’t make any bold moves at all have a very different path and trajectory. You can think about how the experiences of individuals vary based on their openness to doing this early on in their career versus later, and then more frequently versus not at all.', 'Bill Schaninger: But the willingness of people to try that is a personality component here, which is “openness to experience.” There are people who shrink away from what we call “bold moves” because they’ll recognize what they’ve done previously and what’s coming in front of them. And it might just appear a little risky to take on the new tasks and challenges.', 'Anu Madgavkar: There are personal choices, personal qualities, and risk-taking abilities that influence this. We also found that organization context matters. Some organizations are just better at unlocking these possibilities for workers.', 'We studied this in a way that actually measured how companies invest in training, how much they invest in training, and how much they focus on internal role mobility to open up opportunities for their workers within their own companies. Then we looked at how good they are in building overall organizational health and a positive culture.', 'We found through these work histories that people who’d had the exposure to high-performing organizations early on in their career were actually more likely to be able to be upwardly mobile and to take advantage of those opportunities in the future. So the onus is equally on individuals, but equally on employers to create the conditions that help and enable the whole process of learning through work experience.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Could you give us an example of the difference that experience and bold moves might make for folks who begin their career at roughly the same starting point?', 'Anu Madgavkar: Take the story of two people who joined architecture firms, for example. Both individuals come in with a certain set of trainings and credentials based on their education, but one person joins a firm where work processes are quite traditional: they do good work, but you don’t really have an opportunity to learn, for example, how to use new digital tools in the process of architecture. Whereas the other person moves into a more tech-savvy firm where some of those new tools and techniques are put to work. And that person learns those skills.', 'The second person may also have opportunities to get involved in client development and learn the front end of what it means to be successful: [that person can learn] how you actually sell your services to clients potentially by accompanying a senior partner and going with them on a client call.', 'That sets up the second person to then move on and take on positions of greater responsibility where both the new tools and techniques as well as the softer skills that they’ve acquired are put to work.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How do we measure an individual’s human capital?', 'Anu Madgavkar: We’ve estimated lifetime earnings for individuals based on their past work history and their current occupation, and looking at salary growth data across national statistics as well and mapping that back. But crucially, and perhaps for the first time, we’ve come up with a methodology to attribute earnings to the skills that are actually put to work in each role and each job that the person plays.', 'So we’re then able to bifurcate the skills into, “How much of your earnings came because of entry-level skills that you had when you entered the workforce? Versus, how much did you actually start earning because of new skills you acquired while at work?”', 'Bill Schaninger: It was a fascinating breakdown of the data when you just look at what was contributed by each and what was new. Sometimes people ask us, “Well, is human capital compensation?” No, compensation is the marker of what the market wants to pay for and how it’s realized over time.', 'Lucia Rahilly: But many people who are starting out are not going to have either the credentials or the working experience to attract job offers from those employers. Is it realistic to suggest that particular path? Or does something need to change in order for more folks to have access to those talent incubators and for this to have positive impact at scale?', 'Bill Schaninger: As you were asking the question I was thinking, “Wow, we’re smack in the middle of the equitable-access question there.” Companies that are run better do better on this. The more that we’re in a talent crunch, the more companies have to think differently about sourcing. The more they’re thinking differently about sourcing, they’re thinking more expansively about not just, “Oh, do you have the degree? Or what schools did you come from?”', 'They are looking for an opportunity to say, “This person could conceivably develop these skills. This person could conceivably do this.” “OK, we can take some bets here.” So I think it’s a wonderful opportunity in terms of the equitable-access part. Because organizations, perhaps backed into a corner but perhaps just of their own orientation, are saying, “We’re going to give a broader aperture here and make it more available.” The environment we’re in has really exacerbated this.', 'Anu Madgavkar: Yeah, I think there’s a real tailwind now in terms of this shift that organizations are making to view people in terms of their potential and not just typecast them into what you think they’re capable of because of what they’re currently doing. That tailwind is because of the labor market tension at the moment where quit rates are high, vacancy rates are high, and companies are desperate, as Bill said.', 'I think the other really interesting thing that we found was that there were a lot of midsized and smaller companies in our data set that actually were good at not limiting their perception of their employees’ capabilities. And size, therefore, is not the only predictor of how good a company will be for your career.', 'But it’s not transparent to employees who are looking around and thinking about their career moves as to what role your prospective employer can actually play for you. The more that companies are more transparent about how they’re doing this well and what outcomes they’re able to deliver to people, the better it is. The matching process would be better with more information.', 'Bill Schaninger: There is something here for organizations and individual managers to get comfortable with the idea that they’re going to support employees taking on different roles, either within an organization or outside the organization, comfort in knowing that excellent people always have excellent opportunities.', 'But if you’re viewed as a facilitator of that, you will have more people knocking on the front door, and then more people looking for those opportunities. It becomes a virtuous cycle like the classic idea of an academy company.', 'I do think the role of the organization here and individual leaders is not to covet and control talent but to acquire it and develop it and make it as brilliant and shiny as possible and know that a good number of their employees are going to leave.', 'That mindset, I think, is a pretty big deal, particularly in a time of scarcity, when you would think the opposite would be true. They would hold on and not let anybody go. And I think that would be the mistake.', 'So I love the idea that we have these smaller companies in there that we look at and say, “There’s a mindset here around the brilliance of the individual and helping develop it and hone it and make them shine as bright as they possibly can and keep that going, right?”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Bill, I think what you’re saying is that employers become talent magnets when they are also talent accelerators, right? But to Anu’s point about smaller companies, it feels like becoming an academy company requires access to a lot of resources. How does this work, Anu, in the context of start-ups or smaller brands, as you mentioned?', 'Anu Madgavkar: There’s all kinds of talent acceleration that’s possible. And we find that some of the most effective ways to accelerate talent is learning through coaching and apprenticeship on the job. Smaller companies that may not be able to invest in a lot of more structured learning opportunities can still deliver a lot of hands-on, on-the-job training.', 'And the fact that many of these might be quite flat in terms of organizational layers means that people in teams get the opportunity to work with very talented and more experienced individuals in a real-time, hands-on, personalized way.', 'That’s an unparalleled learning experience. So I would argue in fact that for larger organizations, part of the magic they have to create is: How do you marry the structured learning with that feeling of working in a really flat, small team where you learn dynamically by working closely with very talented and more experienced individuals?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Suppose I’m a leader and I’m operating in this super tight labor market. What are some concrete steps that I can take to become a talent magnet and better increase the value of the human capital in my organization?', 'Bill Schaninger: One of the important things for them to do is have a good handle on the skills that their current employees possess, what their potential might really be, and actually invest in it. Sometimes I think we pigeonhole people.', 'The first way is being a little more expansive in your thinking about what that person’s potential and capacity actually are. The second thing is thinking about who you can attract up front, and who you would hire might also need a similar push on expansiveness.', 'Again, Lucia, we were talking about equitable access. In professional services and consulting, we used to think you had to have an MBA. Less than half of the people for us have MBAs now. And one of the things we did was hire clever people and did our own mini-MBA program to give them a basic jumping-off point.', 'We’ll trust that things like apprenticeship, mentorship, and training on the job will enhance their skills. Not everyone’s going to make it. But a lot will. And some are going to really thrive. There’s a way that you make it part of everyone’s daily life that they see people changing jobs internally on a regularly rapid basis.', 'You shouldn’t have someone in a role for ten, 12, 15 years. That’s counter to what we’re talking about. Dynamism in talent matters quite a bit, so people can see that you’re committed to it, especially in times of scarcity.', 'The thing that we keep talking over is mentorship, apprenticeship, and coaching. Who are we relying on? We’re relying on people leaders. We’re relying on middle managers. We’re relying on people who have the opportunity to really shape this person’s career.', 'So the quality of those people providing the apprenticeship, the coaching, and the mentorship matters massively—organizations thinking about who they put in those roles, not in controlling activity but in growing the next generation of employees, in growing the next generation of leaders. I think what we’re talking about here is a much more expansive view of what individuals are capable of.', 'Dynamism in talent matters quite a bit, so people can see that you’re committed to it, especially in times of scarcity.', 'Lucia Rahilly: What did the research show about geographic variation? Did the value of experience differ by country?', 'Anu Madgavkar: The value of experience did differ by country. We studied four countries in depth, three more-advanced economies: the US, the UK, and Germany, where the value of experience was between 40 percent and 45 percent of lifetime earnings, so roughly half.', 'We also studied a developing economy, India, where the value of experience was almost 60 percent. It was higher than in the other countries. And we believe that’s because the value of experience is greater for workers who have lower levels of educational attainment, because most of what they learn then is on the job. And their prospects depend on what they learn on the job. That structural difference between these two kinds of countries does explain a lot of that variation in the value of experience.', 'Lucia Rahilly: It can be difficult for companies just to create an inventory of current skills. How can leaders illuminate otherwise latent potential among their staff?', 'Bill Schaninger: One of the obvious ones is just remember all the way back at the beginning, how did we measure it? Knowledge, skills, attributes, experiences. Sometimes the best thing you can do is really challenge how many of those are actually necessary.', 'You don’t want to anchor in bias and say, “Oh, they have to come from an Ivy League school. They have to come from engineering, right, in which case you’ll get a significantly disproportionate number of white men with STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] degrees, right?”', 'It’s important to ask, “What really matters?” We can hire people with all sorts of degrees—for example, someone with a master of fine arts. But if a potential hire is clever, passionate, and a participant, leadership has the opportunity to see them as a good fit. People who are hiring must think more broadly about what they actually need for an open position, particularly when it comes to knowledge, instead of defining a person’s value based on their degree alone.', 'It’s a barrier to entry for people to get in. You know, architects, accountants, doctors, all those jobs where you have to have both a degree and a license had made it historically difficult to get into those. What we’re suggesting is: even in the absence of that, a lot of employers can find and go beyond the usual suspects, to find real potential.', 'Anu Madgavkar: Most leaders don’t have a granular idea of the skills their workers possess. And there isn’t much visibility into what else people might do outside of their day job, the kinds of initiatives or task forces or contributions that they’re making outside even their formal role.', 'But we see some encouraging examples where, on top of understanding what skills workers may be capable of, companies are offering career counseling advice or support to employees to help leaders say, “OK, here’s what you do today. But this is perhaps what you could think about doing going forward.” So being very proactive about that is the other muscle that some companies are starting to build.', 'Lucia Rahilly: On the point of staying committed in times of scarcity, it’s tough for managers. Hiring is risky. It’s imprecise. So managers must be loath to introduce even greater mobility into the mix. If that’s right, what should companies be thinking about in terms of changing incentives? How should companies help managers navigate that?', 'Bill Schaninger: Companies have to stay the course. As soon as you start thinking about you, “How am I going to hit my numbers? How is my unit going to hit its numbers?” As soon as you start optimizing for you, you’re no longer optimizing for the enterprise of other people. And it will show.', 'I used to work at a residential psychiatric-treatment center, and I really liked the idea that my assistant, after nine months, was going to be pulled to run the next unit. I had peers who asked me, “Why do you keep looking for your people to be promoted?” I said, “Well, I view that as saying that (a) I’m better, and (b) people want to come to my unit.” You could say it was altruistic. Or it could be just that I wanted to be known as the person who grew supervisors.', 'I do think this is as much a mindset for leaders as anything else—I want to be the finishing school, or I want to be the person who grows and unlocks new opportunities. We have to embed that, the idea that talent is going to come in, and talent is going to go out. And, ideally, when they go they’re a whole lot better and they have more opportunities.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Nevertheless, if your best employees are routinely leaving, development and learning become not just more vital but much more capacity intensive for managers. How does this increased focus on development change the manager’s portfolio? And what needs to happen there to enable it?', 'Bill Schaninger: You could argue they should do their job. If you were to think about where their time should be spent, is it best spent on feeding the machine, on bureaucracy, on administrivia, or on presiding? Or should it be understanding the talent they have and providing real apprenticeship, mentorship, and coaching? I would argue this just forces the hand of the leaders into focusing their time on what really matters.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We spoke on one of the episodes of the McKinsey Talks Talent podcast about talent marketplace platforms. Would an internal talent marketplace be helpful here?', 'Bill Schaninger: I’d say an unequivocal yes. At the core of the marketplace, Lucia, is this idea of match. How much do you match the new skills and what can be expected? And then filling in the gap is what you get from the experience of doing the role and/or coming from your colleagues and the leader.', 'Anu Madgavkar: I think it’s a really big part of addressing the information asymmetry. It can help workers discover new things that they want to do. But it can also, of course, help the company figure out where to source internally without having to look outside.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Before we close, let’s shift perspectives back from the employer to the individual. Any final messages for individuals who are looking to realize their potential for learning, for earnings, for human capital generally?', 'Anu Madgavkar: Particularly for those who are in the early stages of their career, viewing work experience as a way to learn new things, even if that means a short-term or a temporary perceived trade-off in terms of your salary or what feels more like a lateral move rather than an upward move.', 'But if it’s a bold move, chances are that it will set you up for higher momentum going forward. And the going-forward part of the story is huge. Half of all your earnings, two-thirds of all your wealth as an individual through your lifetime, will come from tapping into human capital that you possess, that you have control over for the rest of your life. Have that forward-looking mindset and explore those bold moves.', 'Bill Schaninger: We would not have guessed that the data on experience would be as profound as it is. In some of our earliest conversations, there was this wonderful moment. We were wrestling with, “The die doesn’t have to be cast when you’re 22 or when you’re 18. And that doesn’t have to be: This is it. That you’re tapped out. You’re going to be this thing. And you’re never going to have any other opportunities.”', 'There was a wonderful realization that there’s still a role here for human ingenuity, human motivation, the desire to reach.', 'If you’re willing to bet on you and be thoughtful about the conditions for success and where you’re going to go, wow, what an outsize impact that will have on the rest of your life. And it’s not that your earnings are the rest of your life. But it’s the experiences, the people you meet, the network you grow. Boy, does that have an impact. And so there, I loved the idea that the kids who came from a poor family and couldn’t go to school right away, or the kids who maybe were a little longer on the maturation curve, before they got it together would still get there. It may take a little while for people to get going. I think that’s wonderful. And it doesn’t have to be just a small set who have it nailed and then they’re anointed from day one.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Fantastic. Let’s close there. Bill and Anu, thanks so much for joining us today.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thank you. This was great fun.', 'Anu Madgavkar: It was great to be here.

Here’s what they can do to adapt and thrive.","['Fashion suppliers and brands, like other companies, are facing significant economic and geopolitical challenges. Here’s what they can do to adapt and thrive.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey senior partner Achim Berg talks with executive editor Roberta Fusaro about findings from McKinsey’s The State of Fashion 2022 report. They cover the concurrent effects of the many challenges facing both suppliers and brands, including the war in Ukraine, the pandemic, and inflation.', 'After that: the state of anxiety tends to get a bad rap. But in our second segment, Dr. Tracy Dennis-Tiwary, author and professor of psychology and neuroscience at Hunter College, shares why anxious feelings deserve respect.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Achim, the world has changed since we published The State of Fashion 2022 report. What are the changes that have had the greatest effect on fashion and the textile industry?', 'Achim Berg: The invasion into Ukraine is one of those topics not fully on our radar in November or December.', 'But that’s not the only change that has occurred since we published the report. We also didn’t know that Omicron would be the dominant variant in the first half of 2022.', 'We also did not expect that inflation would be a permanent challenge. We expected, like many governments, that this would be a temporary problem. We expected that the supply chain would normalize after two years of a pandemic. That also didn’t come true.', 'We did not expect an energy crisis.', 'We also didn’t expect that COVID-19 would be a big issue in China again, because China looked like the big winner of the whole pandemic at the end of last year. That’s the challenge of writing a report that tries to somehow predict or frame the future: things often turn out slightly different. But overall, our forecasts provided reliable insight and included topics we identified to drive the industry in 2022.', 'Roberta Fusaro: From the panoply of issues you’ve mentioned, what challenges do suppliers face right now?', 'Achim Berg: There are a lot of different challenges. It depends on which country we look at. Some are quite challenged.', 'The supplier side has a practical problem of delivering what is expected. But they’re also facing the issue of forecasting in a proper way because we don’t know exactly how the consumption patterns will develop.', 'The industry is always a couple of months ahead of the consumer, so they need to make some bets. In this environment, which is much more volatile than what we have seen in the last 20 years, it’s very difficult to make the right bets.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Given the increased risk, how should companies respond? And what are some things that companies can do to hopefully end up on the right side of these big bets?', 'Achim Berg: They should look for real partnerships and closer exchanges with brands because that would give companies access to data and would therefore make things more predictable.', 'On the other side, it’s worthwhile to think about how to flex the system to the maximum, because demand patterns are not as stable as they used to be. Brands and retailers will be forced to react more flexibly to these challenges. And the suppliers are, by definition, at the receiving end, so they will have to increase their flexibility even more.', 'Cost pressure will continue, so they will likely have to work also on the cost side, and also on their tier-two and tier-three suppliers in the whole system.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What were some of the more interesting data that came out from different geographies?', 'Achim Berg: On a global level, we’ve seen a faster recovery than what we expected 18 months ago. We had expected that the whole fashion industry would not get back to 2019 levels until the end of 2022. And on a global level, we already achieved that at the end of 2021.', 'We had expected that the whole fashion industry would not get back to 2019 levels until the end of 2022. And we already achieved that at the end of 2021.', 'You could argue that the fashion industry has shown more resilience and a faster ability to deal with challenges than what we had expected. Maybe we were too conservative in the eye of the storm. That might be another explanation.', 'The recovery was also quite different by region. Asia, with the very strong leadership of China, was the motor of the recovery right at the beginning. They had a very short dip and then they were doing quite well.', 'Europe had the toughest challenge to deal with, because they were lacking international travelers. Also, given the fragmentations of the markets, the recovery wasn’t that fast or that strong.', 'North America was remarkable. We’ve seen a V-shape recovery, which we had seen after some of the financial crises before. But we didn’t expect to see that here in the pandemic. If we look forward, it’s difficult to make predictions, as we discussed earlier.', 'China is currently quite challenged with its zero-COVID-19 policy, but we don’t know how long it will take to get recovery here. Let’s hope for the best, because that’s going to be very important in particular for the luxury part of the industry. Europe is currently doing better, because we see travel coming back. North America is still going strong.', 'It will heavily depend on how long the war in Ukraine continues, how long that will impact the cost of energy, and also how much stimulus the different governments will be able to provide after two years of continuous stimulus against the pandemic.', 'So the jury is out. We should prepare accordingly for some challenges we could face.', 'Roberta Fusaro: During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, we talked a lot about companies accelerating their use of technology. Has that momentum continued?', 'Achim Berg: Technology plays a very important role. We also just published the new State of Fashion Technology Report 2022, which makes an important point: that we have to think about technology really end to end.', 'We used to focus more on the front end—everything that was more consumer focused, through e-commerce, through loyalty systems. But we are realizing now that the back end also needs to be digitized for many reasons.', 'Traceability from a sustainability point of view has become more important and will become even more important going forward. So digitizing the whole supply chain end to end is a big topic for many of our clients. And that’s also why technology investments for the fashion industry are expected to ramp up.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thinking about the challenges now for brands, what obstacles do these organizations face?', 'Achim Berg: It all comes down to consumer demand. And as I said, we had hoped that 2022 would mark the end of the pandemic, that certain freedom would return that would allow people to celebrate, to entertain. And the fashion industry was very ready to dress consumers exactly for that. And, to a certain extent, we see that that is happening. Some of the categories that were hammered throughout the pandemic, like dresses, high heels, even suits, have had a strong return in the first five or six months of this year.', 'We also expect that people will do a lot of traveling. Europe is clearly returning to the whole vacation industry; I think Americans will do the same, and Asia as well, with the exception of China. That will drive consumption.', 'In a way, despite a looming recession and inflation rates, we see that consumers have a kind of backlog and a desire to spend on fashion. The problem is that energy bills will continue to increase, and we don’t know how long the conflict between Russia and the Western world will continue.', 'The conflict will likely continue to have a negative impact on the cost of energy and on the cost of living. Realistically, we might see a lot of consumers returning from vacation and from a great summer, realizing that everything has become much more expensive. That could hit larger parts of the fashion industry—in particular, the discount, the value, and the midmarket segments. The jury’s still out on how luxury will play out in this environment.', 'We were all surprised by how quickly luxury returned from the lows of the pandemic. This return has mainly been driven by China, but also by a very strong recovery, and a fast recovery, in the United States. The demand for luxury is super strong at this point in the year. I’m more concerned with the Christmas business and, in particular, the outlook for 2023.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thinking about that, Achim, what should brands do?', 'Achim Berg: Brands should prepare for a likely recession. If the recession is not happening, we’re all going to be positively surprised.', 'But—given the current inflation levels all around the world, driven by energy cost increases, and the fact that interest rates are increasing around the world—that will have an impact on a lot of things. It will have an impact on consumption patterns. It will have an impact on refinancing patterns and on the cost structures of companies. What we’re discussing with a lot of the clients is how to prepare for that.', 'On the one hand, that means having a robust plan for the demand side and for how to flex your systems, similar to the suppliers, to varying demands. The industry has been quite innovative in that respect over the last two years of the pandemic. This will somehow have to continue.', 'On the other hand, the industry will have to manage costs. Many of the leading players have started to tackle that by reviewing their investment budgets, reviewing their cost structures, and preparing for a challenging 2023. That is what brands will have to focus on in the coming months.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Most companies in this industry have been challenged for several years now. How do they respond to these disruptions? And how do they find ways to invest in new technologies?', 'Achim Berg: 2020 was the worst year from an economic-profit point of view since we’ve collected data about this industry—probably going back to the Great Depression.', '2021 was a recovery year for many. And in that respect, a more difficult 2022 and an even more difficult 2023 could have some devastating effects to the industry. Our report also shows that profitability is more and more polarized in the industry.', 'In 2020, less than one-third of the companies were value generating, while two-thirds were value destroying. So a longer recession and a more challenging environment will definitely lead to a shakeout in the industry. We also see there are a few companies we call the “super winners,” the top 20 performers of the industry. But you could broaden that to the top 20 percent of the industry that are quite healthy. These companies have already started to invest in technology and digitalization. They’ve invested in sustainability, they’ve invested in talent—all the things that you would want to invest in. They also have a more balanced, more global business. So they will likely get better through the months ahead.', 'Without any question, companies will have to do this transformation away from physical stores and toward a more digital business model. They will have to find ways to redirect budgets into those areas. That will be more difficult for some than for others, which will likely lead to even more polarization in the industry.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Is sustainability one of those factors in thinking about how companies are going to transform?', 'Achim Berg: Sustainability is the big topic for the industry. It was the big topic before the pandemic hit and it continues to be the big topic.', 'I always say that we’re going through different stages. It took us a couple of years to really create awareness for the topic and for the industry to accept that sustainability is a big topic—not only on CO2, but also on worker rights, worker conditions, and pollution in a much broader sense. The industry has finally accepted the challenge.', 'A lot of companies have now made commitments, most of them until 2030. COP26 was a big event in that respect. We’re now heading into a phase where the industry has to deliver against those promises. And that coincides now with a phase where we likely have limited budgets and more stress on the demand side. So, without any doubt, it would have been much better in the end, and also for the planet, if we were having a stronger recovery after the pandemic. But that’s unfortunately not what we are facing.', 'On the other hand, the planet cannot afford an industry that’s not making progress. So, in that sense, companies will have to do all of that. They will have to deliver against the ambitions of digitalization, and also against the demands of sustainability.', 'Consumers have become more demanding in that respect. A lot of people have been at home throughout the pandemic. They have had more time to think about their consumption patterns. We’ve seen a big change—in particular, in Western Europe and North America—in how consumers think about sustainability and what they demand from brands. Therefore, brands will have to do it all. It’s not going to get any easier for brands in the whole industry in the next 18 to 24 months.', 'Roberta Fusaro: In the report, you talked about the use of digital “product passports,” which contain data about how products came into being and their impact on the environment. Do you think digital product passports are a good tool to help brands reach their sustainability commitments?', 'Achim Berg: Product passports and traceability are the two big topics when it comes to sustainability. Digitalization will be a key lever here: on the one hand, to provide the required transparency along the whole value chain, and on the other, to provide that information to an ever-more-demanding consumer who wants to have that transparency. Let’s not forget that there is a regulator out there that will request that transparency. And the supply chains are very complex.', 'There are different stages. It’s happening in emerging markets. It’s transported in most cases at least around half of the world. So all of that requires the use of technology to provide the transparency and the reliability that you need to drive the business.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are the lessons that companies can take from some of the top companies in our research?', 'Achim Berg: Super winners have been outperforming the industry now for many, many years. That has led to the level of polarization that we have at the moment. We also expect that the top players will get stronger due to the next crisis we are facing, given the resources they have built and the brands and business systems they have built.', 'They are a constant inspiration for the rest of the industry. Not all of what they do can be replicated; many low-performing players have challenges in funding some of the things that the top performers are doing.', 'You need to be active in different geographic regions to balance risk. It also helps to operate across different product categories—a higher share of digital and a more consistent use of data are clearly beneficial to the performance.', 'And then, last, it’s the fashion industry. If you put your chips on the right trend, and if you have the brand heat that you wish for, of course you’re going to do better. And you can be like a phoenix rising from the ashes over the next couple of seasons. That’s the beauty of the industry.', 'We also see some strong brands now that were not that strong before the crisis. So, unfortunately, it’s a sliding scale for many. But there’s always some renewal and innovation and hope. We’re going to see some surprises over the next 24 months, without any question.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thanks so much, Achim, for joining us today.', 'Achim Berg: Thank you, Roberta, for having me.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And now, let’s hear from Dr. Tracy Dennis-Tiwary from our Author Talks series about her new book, Future Tense: Why Anxiety Is Good for You (Even Though It Feels Bad).', 'Tracy Dennis-Tiwary: The core message of the book is that we mental-health professionals have unintentionally given people some damaging information when it comes to anxiety. And we’ve essentially spread a couple of fallacies about anxiety.', 'First, it’s that anxiety is always a debilitating experience, it’s dangerous, and it’s even something we should think of as a disease.', 'That means that the solution would be to prevent it and eradicate it and destroy it at all costs, like we do with any disease. The problem with that, when it comes to anxiety, is that it is literally a recipe for making anxiety worse.', 'There’s a paradox of anxiety: the more we avoid it, the more it tends to spiral out of control. So we not only have more intense anxiety because we’re avoiding it, but we lose the opportunity to look at anxiety and its potentially helpful parts.', 'There’s a paradox of anxiety: the more we avoid it, the more it tends to spiral out of control.', 'Anxiety is an emotion that we’ve evolved to anchor us into the future tense. This ability to think into the future not only protects us but also makes us more persistent, more innovative, more creative, and more socially connected.', 'So this story that we have all come to believe about anxiety is actually really starting to get in the way, especially during a time like the pandemic when we can’t escape anxiety.', 'And that’s the second false idea that we’ve unintentionally spread—we mental-health professionals—that any experience of anxiety is a malfunction and a failure.', 'So what do we do? We start to try to fix it all the time. And we lose those opportunities to see how it can actually be a strength and a source of resilience. Anxiety can be very intense, very extreme, even, but that doesn’t mean that it’s an anxiety disorder.', 'A healthy mindset about anxiety is one in which we look at it very differently than we’re used to looking at it. We’re looking at anxiety as a problem to solve, but anxiety is a feature of being human. And when you look at the difference between anxiety and fear, it starts to help us understand that.', 'Fear is the present certainty. We’re absolutely certain that right now we’re in danger. But anxiety is not that. Anxiety is apprehension about the uncertain future. That is, we know that there’s something coming around the bend. It could be bad, but it could also be good. What anxiety helps us do is prepare to make those good things happen.', 'A second healthy mindset about anxiety involves this perspective about anxiety, that it’s information telling us there’s something happening in the future and we really care enough to make it happen.', 'When we start to think of anxiety not as this dangerous thing but as a helpful thing, that changes everything about how we then face anxious moments, whether they’re controllable or uncontrollable—it helps us cope with that at our best.', 'And a third aspect about having a healthy mindset about anxiety is that we think of it not as something that overwhelms us when we face the uncertain world around us but rather something that helps us navigate uncertainty. Because anxiety is an emotion that evolved to help us translate and navigate the uncertain world.', 'How does anxiety help you?', 'What it helps you see is that because you’re in the future tense and you care about making the good things happen in the future, it helps you see possibilities. It can make us more persistent. It can make us be more fluent to think outside the box to be innovative when we need to, because we see that there’s a possibility for something good to happen.', 'When we’re anxious, we also are more reward focused. We have higher levels of dopamine in our brain when we’re anxious. We typically associate dopamine as a reward neurotransmitter that we feel when we’re experiencing something pleasurable. Well, anxiety triggers dopamine. Why? Because dopamine helps us move toward positive outcomes.', 'It also triggers our social-bonding hormone oxytocin, which increases when we’re with someone we love. It’s one of the ways that we biologically bond to each other. And when we’re anxious, that hormone shoots up. Why? Because social connection, social bonding, is one of the best ways that we manage our anxiety.', 'In the book, I also talk about a three-part framework for doing something with anxiety, for working with it. One is that we remember that anxiety is information, and we need to listen to it.', 'Two is that sometimes anxiety is not useful information. We can learn to tell the difference, and when we do know that it’s not useful anxiety, we can use those great tools out there to let go and immerse ourselves in the present moment, get help through therapy, do those things that help us scale back from the future tense. The third guideline is to really hitch that anxiety, that information we’re getting about what we want in the future, to what we care about, to what gives your life a sense of meaning.', 'Achim Berg is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Frankfurt office.

9,How to manage the coming wave of investment in capital projects,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/how-to-manage-the-coming-wave-of-investment-in-capital-projects,About $130 trillion is expected to flow into infrastructure upgrades over the next five years. How can companies spend that most efficiently?,"['About $130 trillion is expected to flow into infrastructure upgrades over the next five years. How can companies spend that most efficiently?', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey senior partners Steffen Fuchs and Christoph Schmitz speak with executive editor Roberta Fusaro about the massive influx of capital coming companies’ way—most of it earmarked for decarbonizing and renewing critical infrastructure. Hear how executives and organizations will need to adapt their current spending strategies to take advantage of this unique funding moment.', 'After, if you have “perfectionist syndrome,” this one is for you. McKinsey senior partner Dymfke Kuijpers shares how seeking perfection prevented her from finding it.', 'The following transcript has been edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: You wrote an article about how capital projects could receive $130 trillion from public and private sources in the next five years. That capital would be primarily earmarked for decarbonization and infrastructure renewal. Which sectors and initiatives are receiving all the money?', 'Steffen Fuchs: The first thing we need to establish is that the money you are talking about is truly a global allocation across literally every single asset class. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rebuild critical infrastructure. And with critical infrastructure, I think we define not just public infrastructure but all infrastructure across all asset classes.', 'At the same time, it is an opportunity to use this money to think about decarbonization. There will likely not be another wave of capital investments like the one we’re seeing right now to help us decarbonize critical infrastructure. We’re talking about both building new infrastructure and, at the same time, decarbonizing that new infrastructure for future generations to come.', 'Christoph Schmitz: To build on that, roughly 50 percent of this money will end up in real infrastructure and the other 50 percent in sustainability-induced infrastructure, including solar plants, wind parks, electrolyzers, new technologies, steel manufacturing, and others. So these are the two core drivers, and there’s probably a 50-50 allocation of the money to those two sources.', 'Roberta Fusaro: In the article, you note the challenges for executives in managing this influx of capital. What’s different about this wave of capital investment, and what are some examples of the obstacles that executives may face?', 'Christoph Schmitz:We believe that the two differences and challenges will be, on the one hand, just the sheer amount of money to be spent, and on the other, the increased complexity and required speed of the projects. What do I mean by that?', 'If you take many of the sustainability-induced projects, they are no longer what I would call pure technical projects. They will not only need the involvement of many, many more stakeholders—from states and authorities to policy makers and regulators—but also require managing the shortage of resources that we will experience on labor and on assets, such as cranes, raw materials, etcetera.', 'So the complexity is just significantly increasing and will require much more rigorous and sophisticated stakeholder management. And at the same time, the speed of delivering these assets will need to increase. To give you an example, some of the assets need to be in place and up and running in 2027 to achieve the targets, while today’s approval process typically takes five to seven years.', 'So we will need to see—as we have seen in vaccine development recently—a significant compression of the timelines to just meet our targets.', 'Steffen Fuchs: I think the point about complexity is key to acknowledge. And I’m sure many listeners who are in the capital space know this, but a capital project is not typically a one-to-one relationship. It’s a one-to-many-hundreds relationship.', 'As the speed of execution goes up, the interdependencies between those different stakeholders that need to be able to work together in a seamless fashion obviously increase exponentially as well. To Christoph’s point, I think the complexity is one point.', 'Another point is that this is putting a lot of pressure on suppliers and the industry that’s supplying all these capital projects. Think about the amount of green steel we need to produce to actually decarbonize projects. Frankly, there’s not enough capacity in the market today to produce sufficient amounts of green steel or low-carbon steel that lets us meet those targets. The same is true with the workforce.', 'We’re already seeing certain geographies in Arizona, North Carolina, and Ohio that have seen a significant amount of capital inflow, and that is significantly affecting their labor pools. We’ve had a substantial amount of people leave the workforce post-COVID-19. We have not been able to refill those jobs. And so, with this massive influx and the inflationary pressures we’re seeing, costs are going to go up. On average, we’re seeing 10 to 15 percent cost increases in the US today. And schedules will continue to get squeezed.', 'You add those things together—the complexity of the projects, the pressure on the suppliers, and the labor pool—and you can see how this is going to be a very difficult task to deliver against.', 'Christoph Schmitz:One thing to add, return on invested capital [ROIC] will stay the key marker for capital markets to invest and for the valuation of companies. So everything just said increases the pressure on the cost side and, at the same time, on the time-to-market side. Again, this results in pressure on ROIC.', 'And that is something which companies will need to balance going forward: on the one hand, the need to move, to deliver on the sustainability targets, and on the other, there are still the capital markets. They also want their returns and their performance. This will be another angle of required management that we will see out there.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I want to talk a little bit about another point that you make in the article about project-centric strategies that companies have traditionally used and how those might not fit the bill given the increased complexity and the greater speed with which companies need to act. Why, specifically, will this project-centric approach put companies at a disadvantage?', 'Steffen Fuchs: This has such significant implications on the balance sheet of a company that it can no longer be just a project-by-project approach. It actually has to be elevated to the C-suite level.', 'And so what we’re seeing is a much more balanced conversation with CFOs and CEOs who are saying, “I have a portfolio of projects that I need to deliver against over the next five years. All these projects need to be delivered on time and on schedule. They also need to deliver against decarbonization goals, and I need to meet certain ROIC metrics.”', 'That is no longer a job that can be delegated “just to a project team” because, at the end of the day, the project team needs to be empowered to execute against their project plans. They should not be the ones to carry the burden of optimizing and ensuring the entire company portfolio of capital projects is successful.', 'I think the second piece is that it raises the need to think differently about delivering these projects. And what we mean by that—and we’ve been talking about this for a couple of years now—is the use of analytics and the use of digital technology are playing a key role in this delivery approach.', 'We’re seeing many more companies that are investing together with their engineering construction firm partners to say, “How do we establish a baseline where we can constructively collaborate on how to deliver these projects? How do we use machine-learning-based algorithms to reallocate the workforce dynamically when we have a shortage, and we’ll not have idle time with workers?”', 'Again, these kinds of tweaks would also need to cut across all portfolio projects—because the technology itself will not deliver just on one project. It needs to be capable of replication.', 'There’s a third point that I’ll make, which is an approach to best practices. How do we accelerate knowledge sharing? How do we make sure that the best practices from a project carry over in real time to another project, and there’s not a postmortem once the project is done, but it’s a real-time and real-life learning exercise?', 'I think all those things have to come together. Then, it’s very easily understood that it no longer is a project-by-project conversation, but it has to be a C-suite conversation, and it has to be a portfolio conversation to be successful.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How hard or how easy will it be for companies to change mindsets or the way that they’re operating to that degree?', 'Christoph Schmitz: We are talking about a field that, in the past 60 years, probably has not been the most innovative in terms of adopting Industry 4.0: data-based, advanced-analytics-based technologies.', 'We will not only need to see this but also need to see that the way companies run projects will need to change. Changing 50-, 60-year-old habits will require a significant change in leadership, mindset, behavior, and way of working. The good thing is there is the high pressure to deliver on all these projects on budget and on time, so there will be a burning platform to deliver on that on the one hand.', 'Changing 50-, 60-year-old habits will require a significant change in leadership, mindset, behavior, and way of working.', 'On the other hand, this is something that will need to be led from the top and is probably one of the most fundamental changes that this industry has seen in the past 50 years. It’s a true challenge, an Everest challenge, in front of us here.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So, thinking about the collaboration and the innovation required to meet the moment, can you talk about examples of companies that have started to make moves in that direction?', 'Steffen Fuchs: I’ll give you an example on the decarbonization piece because it is truly an example of innovation. We’ve been supporting a food company that’s been thinking about its global footprint when it comes to its facilities producing for local markets.', 'And the company was very explicit about how it’s going to make those allocation decisions based on its carbon footprint, and not just in the sense of, “How much energy are we going to consume?”', 'But carbon footprint in the sense of, “What kind of energy sources will we use?” Is this a renewable energy source? Or is the company going to use a nonrenewable energy source? Carbon footprint in the sense of, “What is the outlook of fresh drinking water available, and where are we going to build our plant for the next 20 years, and what’s our impact going to be on the fresh drinking water supply for the community that we’re going to be in?” Carbon footprint in the sense of, “How far are we going to truck the products if we pick Site A or Site B, and what are the implications on trucking cost?” And then carbon footprint when it comes down to, “How do we actually build the building?” So we’re back to, “How do we build it in a greener way?”', 'When senior leaders in organizations put their minds to it, it actually can happen. It certainly wasn’t easy, and it certainly was a lot of work and a lot of consideration, especially as they built multiple facilities around the globe. But they actually found a way to make this an innovative process to meet their goals to decarbonize and, at the same time, have an apples-to-apples comparison across their portfolio of projects, which was really important to them so that they could go back to their shareholders and to their board of management and explain why they’re making certain decisions in China, in the United States, in Indonesia, and wherever else they were building.', 'Christoph Schmitz:  If you look at industries, innovation very often happens faster and is more radical outside the incumbent players. That is what we currently see in several spaces, where you see attackers in the, for example, electric-vehicle environment, battery factories, and others that are not incumbents.', 'They have the benefit—and you can see it in speed and in action—that they don’t need to change so much, but they immediately can deploy innovative processes, technologies, etcetera to be faster and more effective and efficient. At the same time, they undergo a different ROIC scheme at the capital markets that is geared more toward future growth and less toward current performance. So we currently see quite a number of players out there that are attackers and that are setting the standards for the future in terms of innovation, speed, and radical movement.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Is there something to say about the role and importance of ecosystems and innovation in companies changing their approach to capital management?', 'Christoph Schmitz: If you look at how innovation and change happen, it typically requires singularities that trigger this change. It’s the nature of human beings to be complacent. We want standards, and we don’t like change. It’s very often put into a negative and threatening context: you need to change to defend, and so on. But I prefer this debate: How can we capture this opportunity for the better in all dimensions—making this a much more effective and efficient industry and accelerating the decarbonization that we need to deliver against? How can this industry contribute to this acceleration and to making this a green planet?', 'That is the debate we need. Also, change might come in a much more positive connotation than we typically see it. So it’s a huge opportunity and, at the same time, an obligation for the industry.', 'Steffen Fuchs: I think Christoph nailed it. The only thing I’ll say, Roberta, is if you look at our research and you see that the majority of the capital projects are 80 percent over budget and months behind schedule, you have to ask yourself the question, “What can we be doing differently to avoid similar outcomes in this day and age?” And $110 trillion to $130 trillion is a lot of money. But imagine that being 80 percent over budget. That suddenly is a whole lot more money. This question of, “What can we do differently?” That needs to be asked.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Steffen, what can companies start to do now to change their approach to capital project management?', 'Steffen Fuchs: It has to be a C-suite agenda item. And in that context, it has to be linked to the company strategy. And we would say capex [capital expenditure] may be the new opex [operating expenditure] in the sense that, for the past ten years or so, most companies were focused on, “How do I work my P&L, and how do I reduce my operating cost?” Now it may actually be, “How do I work my balance sheet for the next ten years to make sure I can deliver against the capital expenditures that I need to? And how do I optimize on this front?” I think the second piece needs to be leveraging data. The conversation too often is about past experiences and what has worked in the past versus what’s working today and what’s actually happening in the field on a day-to-day basis.', 'And third, across the ecosystem, or the end-to-end value chain, you need to have conversations about more collaborative contracting behavior and more collaborative partnerships where it’s no longer a question of, “How do I reduce my risk and move liability from Party A to Party B”—because we all know that’s a zero-sum game—but, “How do I reduce risk period, and what do both parties need to do?”', 'Across the ecosystem, or the end-to-end value chain, you need to have conversations about more collaborative contracting behavior and more collaborative partnerships.', 'And we’ve seen this in many industrial industries in the past. I mean, think about the automotive industry. Think about the semiconductor industry and the aerospace industry. Everybody has gone through this transition where tier 1 suppliers, who historically have been treated as vendors, suddenly started to become component suppliers and partners to the OEMs, and they’ve been able to make that shift. We’re not talking about concepts that are way out there and that haven’t been successful in other sectors. I think it’s a matter of, “How do we apply them successfully in this space?”', 'Christoph Schmitz:I just want to complement all the spot-on things that Steffen said because I believe there are two more things. Number one is we will need as an industry or industries to make sure there is capability building and the right capabilities in the organizations.', 'And secondly, the right mindset. We debated at length here about it. It will require a significant rethink in how to lead and steer all of that. In the end, it is all about people.', 'Last but not least, there is the question of resources. I believe that the industry, as total, needs to rethink, “How do we make sure and where do we get the resources from to deliver against all of that?” And resources are everything. It is people foremost, but also, “Where do we get the raw materials and the building materials from? Where do we get the land from?”', 'That’s closing the loop to what we mentioned at the very beginning: the complexity. It’s not only in the hands of the companies to just “deliver the project.” It will require managing and aligning full supply chains, resource pools, etcetera. And that is an area where many companies should start crafting a plan and a strategy for how to do that. And also do that, as we said earlier, under the time pressure.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What advice do you have for the CEO who needs to go about changing mindsets? How can the CEO bring people on board with all this change?', 'Christoph Schmitz: We believe the CEOs need to make this a C-suite topic and a nondelegable topic. That might mean that the installation of a chief technology officer is required to really anchor this on the C-suite.', 'Steffen Fuchs: Having that as part of your regular dialogue with the board of directors or with the management team by itself will raise the significance and the importance. We need to have a similar in-depth and fact-based conversation about what our capital costs are doing as we used to have about our cost of goods sold. And just simply making that a part of the regular management agenda will shine a light on it.', 'Another important point is not accepting the status quo as good enough of an answer. I think there is a role of being a bit of the chief instigator and asking for innovation and asking for what can be done differently as a means to keep pushing the ceiling and saying, “OK, what are we trying? What have we learned? What are the best practices? How do we replicate this?”', 'Christoph Schmitz: Last but not least, I believe there is also a new role that probably only the CEOs can take. If, and many of these projects will require this, there is a need for interaction with authorities, with governments, with regulators, and with policy makers. Again, nothing you can delegate.', 'I personally also believe that it might be beyond the battery limits of a company, so whole industries, CEOs, and C-suites need to go shoulder to shoulder and approach authorities and say, “Hey, how do we get this compressed? How do we get this accelerated?” So it’s totally new and probably unseen and unheard of. This is, again, a C-suite leadership requirement.', 'It’s really an opportunity. That should be the mindset that we carry forward and spread to the world. Let’s capture this opportunity to save our planet or at least contribute to its survival.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And now we hear from McKinsey senior partner Dymfke Kuijpers from our My Rookie Moment series about how deeply imperfect perfectionism is.', 'Dymfke Kuijpers: The first time I worked as a project manager, I was going to do everything perfectly. I was going to be the best leader McKinsey and those we worked with would ever see—the best problem solver and the best team leader. At McKinsey, we give one another constant feedback. And coming into the role, I’d gotten feedback that I was decent at leading clients, solving problems, and getting things done, but what I didn’t get many compliments on was how I lead people and teams. So I thought, “Now is my chance. They made me a project manager; hell, am I going to get it right!”', 'And I told the team that I really, really, really want to be the best people leader they ever had, their best project manager, and most appreciative of them and their development.', 'That went absolutely nowhere. At the end of the study, we did the feedback, and I was super excited because I had really spent time and effort on this. The feedback I got was an endless list of things that I should have done better, moments where I had missed people’s emotions: everything I had said that I would work on. I felt so bad because this was not what I had envisioned. I was going to be “Miss Perfect” on this project.', 'A few more projects went by, and then I got some excellent advice from one of my mentors. She said, “You’re doing this completely, completely wrong. You should not emphasize the areas that you’re not good at. You shouldn’t say, ‘I’m going to be the best people leader.’ You should say, ‘I’m good at leading clients. I’m good at solving problems. Let me use this project to help you on those dimensions.’” So that’s what I did. And it was fascinating to see that there was a 180-degree difference in the ratings after doing that.', 'Suddenly, I was a very good people leader, and people loved the way I coached them. What I have taken from that experience in my broader life, as well as professionally, is don’t ever try to be perfect. I am for sure not perfect. Nor is anyone. Focus much more on the things you’re really good at and that you enjoy. You amplify those, as opposed to focusing on the things you might not be perfect at.', 'Steffen Fuchs is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Dallas office, Dymfke Kuijpers is a senior partner in the Singapore office, and Christoph Schmitz is a senior partner in the Frankfurt office.

She explains how greater support for Latino workers, business owners, consumers, savers, and investors in the United States could create economic opportunities not just for individuals and families in this demographic but also for the whole country.', 'After that, you’ll hear from Nimit Patel, a principal data scientist at McKinsey, about where his “random walk” (or career exploration) at McKinsey has led him.', 'This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is hosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Lucy, thank you so much for joining us today.', 'Lucy Pérez: Thank you so much, Roberta. I’m really looking forward to the conversation.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So we’re here to talk about the economic state of Latinos in America, based on a McKinsey research report. I know you have a personal connection to some of this research, as your father owned and ran a few restaurants. How does his experience compare with today’s generation of Latino entrepreneurs?', 'Lucy Pérez: Indeed, the subject of this report is something that’s very personal to me. One of the statistics that most surprised me was the fact that one in 200 Latinos opens a new business each month. That is the highest degree of entrepreneurship that you see in any demographic group in the US. It was striking to think that my dad was one of those Latinos opening new businesses. I was the first one in my dad’s family to go to college. That was possible because of the growth and opportunity my dad created for us through his business.', 'As we dug into the data, we learned about how 72 percent of Latino entrepreneurs rely only on friends and family to support their businesses. That was the story for my dad and so many of his friends. When you think about the potential opportunity to invest in these entrepreneurs, to grow and have a stronger American economy for all, it’s a very exciting story.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The story does have so many hopeful elements to it, but as the report points out, it’s also complicated, right?', 'Lucy Pérez: We often talk about these very positive trends, like Latinos having the highest degree of entrepreneurship, or Latinos having a higher labor force participation rate than non-Latino Whites, or Latinos having increasing consumption power. But what these rosy indicators sometimes mask is how fragile this growth is. If we invest in these entrepreneurs, workers, and communities, we can drive a strong American economy for all. It is personal, but it’s also about our society as a whole.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I think what’s most practical and accessible about the report is that you’ve organized it around Latino workers, business owners, consumers, savers, and investors. I’m curious to hear about the challenges and opportunities for each of these groups. Let’s start with the Latino worker. How are we compensating workers currently?', 'Lucy Pérez: Today in the US, Latinos make up about 17 percent of the workforce. When we look at the numbers, what we see is that, on average, Latinos are paid 73 cents for every dollar that is paid to non-Latino White workers. If we were able to close this wage disparity, we would be talking about an additional $288 billion that would be supporting Latino workers. This could help move more than a million Latino families into middle-class standing.', 'Furthermore, if we were able to close the representation gap that exists in professions like academia, STEM 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\\r               \\r \\r -related careers, and careers requiring a professional degree, we could close half of this $288 billion. But the truth is that today, a large number of Latino workers are concentrated in low-paying jobs. By 2060, 30 percent of the US labor force will be Latino. So it becomes all the more paramount to think about how we make sure these workers have the right conditions to succeed not only for themselves but for their families and the US economy.', 'By 2060, 30 percent of the US labor force will be Latino. So it becomes all the more paramount to think about how we make sure these workers have the right conditions to succeed.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What can companies do, or what are they already doing, to bring in more Latino workers?', 'Lucy Pérez: What we’re seeing with organizations is that they’re looking at how to increase representation in their workforce at different levels. From the very top, we’re seeing an increase in diversity in board composition, though representation at the board level still significantly lags for Latino leaders.', 'We’re seeing this increase in recruiting targets for more diverse hiring in the entry-level positions. What’s also interesting is how companies are choosing to invest in helping to advance and promote workers through their different career levels. We’ve also seen many of our clients establishing partnerships with institutions that, for example, tend to have a higher proportion of Latino students and creating internships and other vehicles to create an easier path into the workforce to expand the talent pool.', 'Another clear area of opportunity, as we think about hiring for jobs, is how to do more skills-based hiring versus degree-based hiring. Increasingly, we see people learning skills in context, outside of academic degrees. That can be extremely valuable.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Generally speaking, how are today’s Latino youth faring compared with their parents?', 'Lucy Pérez: For Latinos, the concept of the American dream is ingrained in who they are, and this idea that the children do better than their parents. And when we were looking to see if the facts support this, what we see is that Latinos in general have rates of intergenerational mobility that are comparable to those of the White population.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The number of Latino-owned companies has grown over the past five years at more than double the rate of White-owned firms. Yet Latinos still don’t have access to the same levels of capital. Why?', 'Lucy Pérez: One of the things that we learned about Latino entrepreneurs is they tend to have narrower networks that are more focused on family and friends. At the same time, when we look at private equity and venture capitalists, they’re investing less than 5 percent of their capital in Latino-owned business firms. So we clearly have an opportunity here to connect the dots between this growing number of entrepreneurs and those investors.', 'One of our clients, a financial institution, made a customer offering specifically for these entrepreneurs to drive greater growth in small businesses owned by Latinos. And that has turned into a significant vector of growth for that banking institution—so much so that the CEO spoke of Latinos as their hidden growth opportunity in several of his communications to employees.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I want to shift our focus now to the Latino consumer, another segment in the report. In the report, we note that although consumption among Latinos in the United States has grown about 6 percent per year for the past eight years, there’s still this $660 billion in unmet demand each year. What accounts for such a huge number?', 'Lucy Pérez: The consumption gap that exists today is quite significant. Those $660 billion are the result of a couple of factors. On one hand, it is about lacking the goods and services that meet the needs of Latinos—not having those accessible, for example, in the neighborhoods that they live in. We know that Latinos are more likely to live in what we call “healthcare deserts” or “banking deserts.” These are areas where the provision and availability of healthcare or banking services, for example, are lower. And Latinos may be spending more on average, for example, to secure housing in these areas.', 'So that’s one part of the equation. The other part of the equation is that the willingness to pay for goods and services is very different for Latinos relative to other groups. What we find is there are certain categories where Latinos would be willing to pay more, should they find the right provisions and services for their needs.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there specific first steps that companies and government organizations can take to help improve the situation or close that gap?', 'Lucy Pérez: There are several steps that can be taken to close that consumption gap. One is focusing on the consumer insights of organizations in order to serve the needs and wants of this Latino population that by 2050 will be one in four Americans. We must answer the question, “Are we designing goods and services to meet those needs and preferences?”', 'The second step is thinking about how these goods and services are provided. Do we have mechanisms to meet these consumers where they’re at? Are we choosing to place our locations in geographies that make them more accessible to these consumers?', 'Roberta Fusaro: In the report, you also talk about the opportunity for Latino wealth creation. Latino wealth is on an upward trajectory, but there is still lots of ground to cover. Tell us about that.', 'Lucy Pérez: The trajectory in Latino wealth creation is positive. But the challenge, again, is that we’re starting from such a small base when we look at this population. The median net worth of a Latino family is only about $36,000. When you compare that with what it is for a non-Latino White family, it’s almost five times that: closer to $200,000. What drives the majority of this gap is inheritance or intergenerational transfers—wealth that’s passed from one generation to the next.', 'We see a much lower rate of that happening for Latinos because Latino household wealth starts from a much smaller base. That is also driven by those lower wages we were talking about for the workers. The other factor that contributes to this lesser ability to have intergenerational wealth transfers is lower participation in the stock market. Less than 5 percent of Latino families have direct holdings of stocks. When you think about how much wealth has been created—even, for example, over the past decade or two—this is a vehicle that Latino families have not been able to tap into as much as other demographic groups.', 'Roberta Fusaro: When it comes to Latino savers and investors, are there good resources emerging that we could point listeners to?', 'Lucy Pérez: On one hand, you have financial institutions that are investing a lot more in building educational content and making resources available, particularly online, around how to access capital, how to save it, and how to invest it. That is one part of the equation. We’re also seeing community groups investing in educating the societies where they operate. They bring people together and facilitate exchanges of best practices and offer courses.', 'Increasingly, you’re seeing an interest from policy makers to shift more resources toward these underrepresented groups, making it easier for them to tap into capital opportunities. However, the resources may not always be accessible to the people who need them—by accessible, meaning not only physically accessible but in a way that is easy to understand and act on at the right time.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What is the broader macroeconomic opportunity that we’re looking at here?', 'Lucy Pérez: To me, the key part of the report is that this is an opportunity for America to build a stronger economy. This is not a Latino issue that we need to solve just for Latinos. I think about the fact that we can be creating six-plus million jobs for Americans by investing in these Latino entrepreneurs. We can create better products and services to benefit the needs of all American consumers, not just US Latino consumers. It is an exciting opportunity to drive that stronger American economy.', 'Roberta Fusaro: This is a first-of-its-kind report for McKinsey. What questions does this report raise that you’d like to tackle next?', 'Lucy Pérez: We chose to focus on the overall framework around wealth creation and how these different roles play off each other, as well as bringing in new data to understand that Latinos are not a monolith. We’d like to explore the differences between different groups of Latinos because of what generation they represent in the US or their country of origin. We want to continue to recognize the ways in which we can better serve the Latino consumer so that we can drive some of the growth we talked about, closing that $660 billion consumer spending gap that we see for this community.', 'We can continue to explore answers around what it will take to unleash Latino entrepreneurship at scale and drive investment dollars toward these Latino entrepreneurs so that they can create additional American jobs and a broader set of goods and services to benefit the community.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Lucy, this has been a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining us today.', 'Lucy Pérez: Thanks so much, Roberta.', 'Nimit Patel: I build machine learning and data science models for clients in different industries. Lately, I have been focusing on GEMs 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             Global energy and materials.\\r               \\r \\r  and heavy industries. I use data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to optimize heavy-industrial processes at power plants and chemical plants. For the past one and a half years, I have been based in McKinsey’s Pittsburgh office. Pittsburgh is a community-type office where everybody knows one another’s names, daughters’ names, nephews’ names, etcetera.', 'I studied mechanical engineering in India for my undergraduate degree. Toward the latter half of my time as an undergraduate, I realized that mechanical engineering is not something that I wanted to do as a career for the rest of my life. My goal became to get my master’s degree and then apply that experience to something much more pragmatic and get some work experience in the United States.', 'In the first few years at McKinsey, I did what we call a random walk, where you work in different domains. Even during my early years at McKinsey, the majority of my focus was on trial and error, through a process of elimination, to make a more informed choice on what I’d be happy doing for a sustained period of my life.', 'Something that strikes me about McKinsey is how they’ve adapted over time. For example, business has become anchored in data, with the most recent wave of analytics, machine learning, and computer science. McKinsey has adapted to this by moving away from just traditional strategic consulting and toward a more technology-driven company.', 'Never be afraid to say yes to something, even if you don’t know how to do it. It’s always possible to know or figure it out on the fly while you’re solving \\r the problem.', 'Recently, I was on a project working to help a power plant company. We were helping them optimize their processes through analytics. And what we helped them do is to build models that helped them understand how fast equipment will degrade and when it would require maintenance and also to understand how the maintenance of that equipment will affect the efficiency of the overall power plant. It was exciting because I could see the real-world implications of it in that time period. We are able to help a company navigate these changing market conditions and use data to make smarter decisions, which was very exciting to me.', 'As I look back over my time at McKinsey—now that I have been here for five years—my biggest takeaway is to never be afraid to say yes to something, even if you don’t know how to do it. It’s always possible to know or figure it out on the fly while you’re solving the problem. And over time, I got more comfortable doing this because nobody expects you to know everything about everything.

11,Digital transformation on the CEO agenda,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-transformation-on-the-ceo-agenda,Successful digital transformations may not be as elusive as you think. The best CEOs know up front what success looks like—and what stands in their way.,"['Successful digital transformations may not be as elusive as you think. The best CEOs know up front what success looks like—and what stands in their way.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Kate Smaje and Rodney Zemmel—global leaders of McKinsey Digital—talk with McKinsey Global Publishing’s Lucia Rahilly about digital transformation: what it really means, how to deliver on it, and why it should remain front and center on the CEO agenda. Plus, stay tuned for Kate’s and Rodney’s quick takes on trends to watch.', 'After, in an Author Talks excerpt, Amy Webb, futurist and author of The Genesis Machine: Our Quest to Rewrite Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology (Hachette Book Group, February 2022), describes how synthetic biology could open the door to “bespoke children,” significantly longer life spans, and subterranean societies.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: The phrase “digital transformation” has been part of our business lexicon for many years now. And at this juncture, most companies have, presumably, invested a relatively substantial volume of resources in digital and tech. Have leaders made any meaningful progress in reinventing themselves digitally? Or is successful digital transformation still elusive?', 'Rodney Zemmel: It’s become fashionable to say that many digital transformations fail, that it’s hard to get value out of them, and so on. I think that’s created an impression that digital transformation is elusive. The reality is, most big companies have undertaken a digital transformation, and most big companies get some value from that digital transformation.', 'The point of digital transformation isn’t to become digital. It’s actually to generate value for the business. And having a clear, integrated, top-down road map of where that value is is one of the biggest gaps between companies that get the full value and companies that get something that is just a shadow approximation of the full value.', 'Kate Smaje: Another important part of a successful digital transformation is how you define what “good” really looks like here. Because there isn’t a point in time when digital transformation is done. It’s much more about, “How am I building a real muscle for the organization to continue getting better and better as I go on?”', 'The point of digital transformation isn’t to become digital. It’s actually to generate value for the business.', 'Lucia Rahilly: The two of you are talking to leaders on this topic every day. In your work helping leaders reinvent themselves digitally, what are some concrete examples of the kinds of challenges you see?', 'Rodney Zemmel: A common failure mode, or an insufficient success mode, is a chief executive saying, “We’re going to go digital,” and then making public statements about digital strategy. Then every person on their leadership team creates their own digital road map. What you end up with, six months or a year later, are many digital pilot projects across the organization.', 'Instead, the chief executive needs to focus on getting the full leadership team to be able to talk from the same page and have the same set of priorities, and then focus on having a talent and capability road map that is as detailed as their technology road map—and getting that team to move as one against a clear set of technology priorities and people priorities.', 'Kate Smaje: The key here is being able to articulate how value is created in a company. And the challenge that lots of companies find is they don’t have a consistent and aligned way of either identifying or measuring that value, and therefore it becomes harder to go after it.', 'What you typically see 12 months, 18 months, or two years into many transformations is this notion of, “I don’t feel I’m getting as much as I should be.” The root cause of that is often a lack of alignment on where and how that value is going to be created.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s go a little deeper into the how—for example, how leaders assess where transformative value is possible within an organization. What do you suggest there?', 'Rodney Zemmel: There are three rules of thumb that seem to be evolving. First is that companies that get the most value from this actually spend a lot of effort thinking about, “What are the new digital businesses to launch? How can we create new value with new products and new customers versus transforming the existing business processes?” There’s sort of a duality—you should spend as much focus on new digital business building as you do on transforming the current business.', 'Rule of thumb number two is, you’ve got to focus on things that are big enough. And maybe that’s obvious, but it sometimes surprises us how many people will call something a digital transformation, and you add up the total economic impact, and it’s less than, say, 15 or 20 percent of the company’s overall EBITDA. If you’re not targeting at least 15 or 20 percent, in our mind it’s hard to call that a transformation and to sustain the level of organizational focus around it.', 'And then the third rule of thumb is, it’s best to start with a concentration in a particular area rather than sprinkle a little bit of digital or a handful of analytics use cases broadly across the organization. Pick one area of the business and really focus on building some momentum there first and then on growing from there on out. We think those three rules of thumb have emerged from the companies that have been more successful relative to others.', 'Lucia Rahilly: What role do metrics play in assessing the value of digital-transformation efforts?', 'Kate Smaje: Metrics are super important. But it’s important to define those metrics. What you want to get a sense of is, “Is my digital transformation really working here?” And, yes, some of this is financial benefits: there should be a set of outcomes across the business that you’re driving to, whether that’s operational or financial metrics.', 'But it’s also: Is this working in terms of really building this muscle that we were talking about? Are my capabilities being enhanced over time? Are there more people within my organization that understand how to use technology or data better in their day-to-day working? Is it starting to transform the culture? Can I start to see the metabolic rate of the organization speeding up? Are we making decisions faster as a result of this? There are lots of different indicators that you’re trying to build up to get a real sense of, “Is this working?”', 'If you just focus on the financial or the operational pieces—they are important, don’t get me wrong, but they’re not the be-all and end-all. And they often miss whether you’re really creating that long-term, sustainable muscle versus just executing against a bunch of very good initiatives for today.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Do successful CEOs share a best-practice governance model for digital transformations?', 'Rodney Zemmel: In terms of how the transformation is led day to day, we’ve seen a model based on a single transformation leader, and we’ve seen a coleader model—a technology executive and a business executive. Both of those models can work. But digital transformation does really need to be a standing item at the top of the company to make sure it stays on the CEO’s agenda and to show that it’s aligned across the full company agenda.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk a bit now about talent. McKinsey has published a lot about ways that “the Great Attrition,” or what others call “the Great Resignation,” is altering dynamics in the talent marketplace, including exacerbating the talent gap. How is that affecting tech talent in particular?', 'Kate Smaje: This, in many ways, is a wonderful opportunity for tech talent, given how many companies out there are trying to upgrade. And I use the word purposefully. Because this isn’t all about hiring; it’s often about upgrading existing talent, as well.', 'Given there is so much demand for that talent, the fact that some people are taking stock and saying, “What’s the best place for me going forward?” or “Am I getting as much out of my career as I really want to?” is not necessarily a bad thing.', 'What I think folks miss on this, however, is that the hiring part is perhaps the easier part. What people miss is, “How do I make that talent that I’m going to bring in wildly successful once they are here?” And they miss the ways in which you need to think this through: What does this mean for how HR works? What does it mean for spans and layers? What does it mean for comp models or procurement thresholds? And so on. It’s those kinds of issues that, in many ways, are harder than the actual hiring. The folks that don’t fix for those issues ahead of time are, unfortunately, probably going to experience more of the effects of the Great Attrition.', 'Rodney Zemmel: What we’re finding is, the top talent for these technology topics is much more dispersed than it was a few years ago. We’ve seen companies attract the right talent in pretty much any geography you can think of.', 'If you’ve got the right mission, the right set of leaders who are going to put effort behind it, and if you are prepared to make the right technology and career path investments to make those people successful, you’re going to attract them in a much more location-independent manner. That’s piece one.', 'Piece two is the range of talent that you need. A while back, it was focused on just a handful of what we call “technical guilds.” It was all about getting the data scientists or the software engineers. Now, it’s a broader groove—it’s not just data scientists, it’s also data engineers and machine learning engineers. If you’re not in-sourcing agile coaches and leadership for a strong product management function and so on, you’re not going to build the capacity that you need. So a broader array of guilds.', 'And then the third piece, as Kate was mentioning, is this huge potential in reskilling your existing talent. The extent to which companies—even companies in some pretty traditional industries, from engineering backgrounds and so on—have been particularly good at this, in their ability to actually reskill and turn many of their existing people into really strong digital and technical talent, is quite remarkable.', 'Lucia Rahilly: What role do ecosystems beyond the organization play in widening or deepening that talent pool?', 'Kate Smaje: Partnerships are becoming a much more significant way of accelerating the talent upgrade that we’re talking about here. That no longer means outsourcing large swaths of folks, but it might mean partnering on specific capability areas or augmenting talent in the near term in order to get that level of acceleration.', 'For some folks, it’s also about being able to show the real step-up in the bar for quality for that talent. And can we see it, live it, and feel it by bringing in some of those folks, even if it’s for a short period of time, as you upskill and upgrade the talent base that you have?', 'In my mind, technology organizations are becoming more porous. But it is less about outsourcing. It’s not a simple line in the sand on this anymore. It’s much more about how to collaborate in an ecosystem of partners in order to really accelerate and upgrade that talent.', 'Rodney Zemmel: More in-sourcing and smaller teams of higher-skilled people, rather than large numbers of technology arms and legs, seems to be the dominant trend.', 'Technology organizations are becoming more porous. But it is less about outsourcing and more about how to collaborate in an ecosystem of partners to accelerate and upgrade that talent.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve seen a lot in the media about the lack of diversity in tech, both in the sector and as a functional capability. Do you see that changing or playing a role in attracting tech talent?', 'Kate Smaje: Yes. It is clearly a perennial issue. We did some research fairly recently around why gender diversity is particularly elusive among tech talent teams. And one of the things we found is, it isn’t so much about a glass ceiling, as we see in many other walks of life, but much more about a broken first or second rung. It’s getting that first promotion, that second promotion, that is affecting the pipeline quite significantly.', 'Rodney Zemmel: Part of the solution on the diversity challenge is how much a company is willing to bet on early-career talent. I’ll give you two facts. Number one is, if you look at how universities have done at getting to gender parity in computer science courses and data science courses and various technical disciplines, that varies by geography, obviously. But there has been a huge success, and many, many top schools have reached parity, or close to parity.', 'And number two is, if you look at the areas where companies are ramping up hiring the most, it’s, of course, in digital and technology areas. So if you combine those two thoughts and say, “Where are we prepared to bet on early-career talent?,” you should be able to use this as an accelerator for diversity in your company, not a decelerator.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How should CEOs think about tech and data as part of a successful digital transformation?', 'Rodney Zemmel: If you’re trying to launch just one or two or three different analytics use cases in your company, you don’t need to worry too much about having a data strategy or data architecture. Because one or two or three use cases is normally pretty manageable.', 'By the time you’re at the inflection point, something really transformational, you need to take the topic of data governance extremely seriously. It’s a federated model, where you have a small, probably central, organization that sets standards, sets rules, sets clear ownership, sets privacy, sets strategy for what needs to be internal, external, and so on.', 'And then you have clear business owners across the business for each data stream within the company, and a view on how you’re actually going to use data to get competitive advantage. So, like many things we’re talking about today, it becomes more of an organization problem than a technology problem. Thinking through that data governance is critical for anyone who has ambition to do something that’s truly transformational, rather than just launch a few use cases.', 'Kate Smaje: And there’s an agenda here around modernization. Often, people get bogged down in the technology road map or the data road map and so on, and miss that this is actually about modernizing the infrastructure of the company.', 'We saw many of these several years ago, where people just wanted to get excited about the shiny new thing: “Build me a new front-end app,” something that we can touch and feel and pat ourselves on the back for. Not understanding how much your technical debt is constraining what you are able to do is becoming a real blocker to execs being successful. So for me, before we go into the tech, the data, and so on, it’s about modernization: modernizing the way in which that infrastructure is going to help you do all the things the business wants to be able to do.', 'Rodney Zemmel: Where I’d be really careful is, there’s often a temptation for companies to say, “Let’s make the technology investment, and then we’ll figure out all the great things we’ll be able to do in the business.” If you’re not working backward from a business case, then you’re unlikely to get the value from it that you’re intending to get.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Particularly during the pandemic, we have talked a lot about speed and the need to maintain an accelerated pace in the digital world. Has the pandemic proved the case on agile ways of working?', 'Kate Smaje: Oh, a wholehearted yes from me on this one. And the reason I say so is because in many ways, it was an overnight experiment in agile. Not just in terms of the speed—many organizations had to work in cross-functional ways that they hadn’t had to do before, because they were asking fundamental questions that required small teams of great people to come together and really solve for them across the siloes of the company.', 'Many employees had to work at a speed, at a metabolic rate, that was very different from their regular day-to-day operations. And we needed to get things done fast—we needed to figure out the resilience of the supply chain, we needed to figure out how we were going to contact customers in new and different ways.', 'Rodney Zemmel: The reality is, although we’ve been talking about agile for a decade or more, very few companies are really doing it at a broad scale across the enterprise. We have a lot of companies that say they’re doing agile, and when you look, they might be doing agile on how they deploy their technology teams. But whether they really have technology and the business working together, in multiple pods across the business—not just in one or two places that has the CEO’s attention on it—that’s rare.', 'What’s even rarer is when you can get the control functions in there as well. And often, if you have technology and business together, but you don’t have legal, regulatory, compliance, finance, whatever the relevant control function is in your context, in the agile pod as well, then you’re not really getting the speed acceleration that you need to get.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk about adoption. We’ve all had the microexperience of rolling out new technology and encountering a sort of wide-ranging, passive resistance. Change is hard—folks may have an innate bias in favor of the status quo. And CEOs are functioning at a very high level within organizations. How do successful leaders ensure that these initiatives actually get traction?', 'Kate Smaje: First is, to get traction this has to be linked to business owners from the start. This can’t be technology pushing out. It also can’t be business throwing requirements over the wall to technology. The integration between business and technology needs to be really, really seamless.', 'The second is, you need to think about adoption from the get-go. This is not something that you do in the linear fashion of creating the product and then figuring out how it will be adopted. It needs to be pulled up front, in terms of designing that product, to make sure that you optimize and maximize adoption from the get-go.', 'The third is, almost as a rule of thumb: for every dollar that is spent on digital, on development, and so on, at least another dollar should be spent on adoption. And then going into this thinking about it as an investment in the success of it as much as an investment in the technology itself.', 'Rodney Zemmel: I want to come back on one word Kate used there: “requirements.” In an IT culture, the business sets the requirements. In a digital culture, you’re not in a requirements world. Instead, there’s a team that is addressing a business problem, or a customer problem. And that team of businesspeople, technologists, and the control function work together to solve that problem. And the word “requirements” is not in there. It’s solving a problem versus working against a sort of order list from the business.', 'To me, there’s one question that matters on adoption, and that is, “Who is responsible for adoption?” That answer should be, “It’s the business leader.” The business leader, the business owners, need to be responsible for the adoption of the initiatives that they are sponsoring to drive profit improvements or growth in their business.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Last question. Any particularly hot or fast-moving digital trends you’re keeping an eye on in 2022?', 'Kate Smaje: Go on, Rodney, you go first. I know what you’re going to say.', 'Rodney Zemmel: I’ll give you two. Fast moving and here right now is MLOps. If you don’t know that word, you should. It’s “machine learning operations.” It’s the operating system—both the technology and the people and processes—that you need to make machine learning work at scale in your organization.', 'As companies or organizations go from doing one or two things in AI or machine learning to really having a powerful enterprise, they need an operating system. They need a way of doing it—an end-to-end operating system for how you’re going to make that work across your company. It’s a pretty complicated topic and it’s moving quickly, but your company, your organization, needs to have one if you are going to get value, at scale, from machine learning or AI.', 'My over-the-horizon trend is quantum computing, or quantum technology, more broadly. If it works—and it is still a science bet—it will change the entire landscape that we’re talking about. So for many companies, it’s worth it just to have an eye on it to understand where it’s up to and what the implications could be.', 'Kate Smaje: Let me offer two more that look slightly different. The first for me is, it’s not about any individual technology as a trend going forward. It’s about the combinatorial power of two or three or four—collide them together and say, “Now, what’s the art of the possible?” Because it’s when you bring them together that the real magic happens.', 'And a second one that I’m seeing enter the conversation more and more, for good and right reasons, is “digital trust”—how we as organizations and as a society are thinking about the interrelated issues of model bias, model explainability, privacy concerns, data residency, and so on.', 'Rodney Zemmel: It’s worth remembering what we said right at the beginning: That the point of a digital transformation isn’t to become digital and to be able to drop technology buzzwords in your investor presentation. It’s to generate value for the business.', 'It sounds really obvious, but just thinking hard about: “What are the key points in your business where you can accelerate value?” And then, “What are the technologies?” or “How do you mobilize the organization against those?” rather than taking a technology-first view is the right way for most organizations.', 'Roberta Fusaro: And now, from digital transformation to DNA transformation: let’s hear from author and futurist Amy Webb about her new book, featured in McKinsey’s Author Talks series, The Genesis Machine: Our Quest to Rewrite Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology [Hachette Book Group, February 2022], coauthored by microbiologist Andrew Hessel.', 'Amy Webb: Some biotech veterans recently raised $3 billion to create a new company on the premise that the fundamental machinery of living cells can be reprogrammed. There’s a flood of capital being directed at synthetic biology right now.', 'This is going to have some important knock-on effects on different industries, including pharmaceuticals and healthcare. But we’re also going to start seeing changes in agriculture, industrial materials, even space, because we’ve now proven that it’s possible to reprogram the fundamental units of life.', 'In the book, we identify nine risks, and they aren’t insignificant. The most worrying data security breaches could actually involve our DNA. This means that this biological era that we’re entering could be an information security problem.', 'There are easy ways to scrape somebody’s genetic code, and that could have widespread implications if that person is a politician or if that person is the CEO of a big company. Bio cybersecurity is another important emerging problem on a much grander level. We think that synthetic biology, because it promises so much, could actually lead to new geopolitical conflicts.', 'The reason that we wrote the book actually has to do with solutions. It’s hard to get people to change.', 'We just saw at COP26, the big climate change conference, that world leaders are just not going to act fast enough to mitigate the climate crisis, especially when what we’re asking countries to do is to stop contributing to their economy by scaling back some of their manufacturing or changing it.', 'We have to develop alternatives. And in this case, synthetic biology gives us optionality. We’re going to have to make personal choices going forward. We should do that when we’re informed, not under duress.', 'In this book, we created five scenarios as a way of helping make all of this research and all of this information much more real to people so that they could envision what the future could look like.', 'The first scenario has to do with a fertility center set in the future. How could synthetic biology influence how we create children in the future? Some of the questions we had included things like, if you could select the genes for your offspring, what would you select?', 'The second scenario has to do with aging. If people are able to live much longer, much healthier lives, how does that change the future of work? How does that change the relationship between a CEO and an executive team, or a CEO and a board of directors? How does that start to shape what a board of directors might be doing? If you’re a family company, how does that shift the decisions that you make? What does succession planning look like in a world in which people can live much longer than they do today?', 'The third scenario of the book is a where-to-eat guide. Synthetic biology will influence how and where we get our food, whether that’s meat produced from cells or plants grown in a bioreactor rather than on a farm. Someday, you might have the freshest sushi that you’ve ever had in your life from a bioreactor in Nebraska versus off the coastal waters of Nagoya in Japan.', 'In the fourth scenario, we explore groups of people who, in an effort to figure out what it would be like to live off-planet, wind up moving underground. It’s a really interesting alternative viewpoint into ways that we might mitigate climate change and live differently.', 'The fifth scenario we found in a paper written by a couple of academics who were curious to know what could happen with having genetic code in one academic lab somewhere and sending it off to China, which is where the sequences are oftentimes put together and sent back. If you send computer code back and forth, there are always vulnerabilities and possibilities for somebody to inject malware. What if somebody injected malware into genetic code but it was undetected?', 'What if something like that actually happened? What would be the response? I’m not going to give it away, but the answer is not a good one.', 'I recognize that some of what’s here is going to be too radical for a general audience, and potentially too radical for CEOs, and too radical even for an audience of scientists. Because what we’re really asking is: What happens when we remove our current evolutionary constraints? What happens when we explicitly view biology as a technology platform?', 'I think the biggest and the most durable inventions of the 21st century are going to be at the nexus of biology and technology. For that reason, I cannot think of an industry that synthetic biology will not have some impact on over the next decade.', 'What gives me hope is that between human ingenuity and the science and technology that we have access to, we can right some of our wrongs and can create better futures. But we can’t approach that with outright fear or a complete utopian ideal. We have to take a pragmatic approach.', 'If we can do that, I think we can live longer, better, healthier, happier lives. I really do. It’s going to be hard work, though.', 'Senior Partner, London', 'Senior Partner, New York', 'Roberta Fusaro is an executive editor in the Waltham, Massachusetts, office.

Here’s what’s at stake—and what might be done to help.,"['The war in Ukraine poses a looming threat to the worldwide food supply. Here’s what’s at stake—and what might be done to help.', 'The pandemic. Supply chain strains. Climatic events. Converging disruptions have sent food prices soaring—and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the world’s six breadbasket regions, risks tilting the food system into global crisis. In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Daniel Aminetzah, leader of McKinsey’s Chemicals and Agriculture Practices, and partner Nicolas Denis talk with global editorial director Lucia Rahilly about the vital roles that Ukraine and Russia play in the global food system, as well as what is at risk as the war continues. This conversation was recorded on April 4, 2022. The following transcript has been edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s start with some context. Access to food is clearly of urgent concern for the millions of Ukrainians in the throes of this tragic invasion, so I first want to acknowledge that vital frontline priority. But the war in Ukraine also threatens to disrupt the food system globally, well beyond the conflict zone. Daniel, help us understand what that means.', 'Daniel Aminetzah: As you rightly recognized, our attention is primarily on the immediate conflict in Ukraine, including the food crisis. As we look at the broader global food supply chain, we clearly see this conflict shaking important pillars of this system in an already disturbed context.', 'In the global food system, previous supply–demand scenarios were mostly encoded around weather and other supply-related events. In the past couple of years, the global pandemic has clearly tested, and in many cases proved, the resilience of the food system. But now, we are in an unimaginable situation: a war of this scale in Europe, in such a critical food supply hub—especially when it comes to wheat and to fertilizers—as the Black Sea.', 'This instability starts to create a whiplash effect in the food supply chain. It’s hard to fully project the implications, but this crisis will have clear secondary effects on other breadbaskets, like Brazil. Russia and Belarus are critical for the export of fertilizer, which is the most important yield driver for farmers globally.', 'This event has also hit us at a point where we’ve seen unresolved challenges from sustained high prices for agricultural commodities and fertilizers since late 2020. We’ve seen corn prices, for example, at well above $5 per bushel since early 2021—well over a year now.', 'Despite efforts to strengthen the global food supply, and the overall resiliency we’ve seen in the past couple of years, we are quite concerned. The world, to some extent, seems unprepared for the crisis unfolding now. One exception is China, which has significantly increased its strategic reserve by over 70 percent since 2008. But many other markets in the world are not at the same level of readiness.', 'The instability from the Ukraine–Russia conflict starts to create a whiplash effect in the food supply chain. It’s hard to fully project the implications, but this crisis will have clear secondary effects on other breadbaskets.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk more about this whiplash effect and the scale of the potential disruption. Nicolas, how much of the global food supply is at risk?', 'Nicolas Denis: Globally, there are six breadbaskets that together supply roughly 60 to 70 percent of global agricultural commodities. The Ukraine–Russia region is responsible for roughly 30 percent of global exports of wheat and 65 percent of sunflower, in a context where those markets are increasingly tight and interconnected—so a slight disruption in supply creates some impact on price.', 'Of course, we don’t know what the length and scale of this conflict will be. We ran some scenarios, and from our perspective, between 19 million and 34 million tons of export production could disappear this year. If we fast-forward to 2023, the figure could be between ten million and 43 million tons. To translate, that represents caloric intake for 60 million to 150 million people.', 'And the price of those commodities will affect an even broader range of the population, beyond the 60 million to 150 million people. For example, countries like Egypt and Turkey significantly rely on exports from this region for the caloric intake of their citizens. In fact, Egypt relies on Ukraine and Russia for 60 percent of its imports. And while the imports are important for its domestic consumption, Egypt also processes these commodities to export to Eastern Africa. So the impact of what’s happening in Ukraine and Russia will be felt across many countries.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And to be clear, how much of the supply shock is due to the physical effects of the war on agricultural production? Are Ukrainian farmers able to proceed with planting their spring crops?', 'Nicolas Denis: The agricultural value chain is a bit more complex than other supply chains because there are some specific windows for preparing the field, for planting, and for harvesting. When we’re running our scenarios to understand the implications of this conflict on agriculture, we take those specific windows into account.', 'For instance, for barley, sunflower, and maize, the planting season is happening right now. It’s unclear if all the farmers in the region are able to plant those crops at the moment. There are some other crops, like wheat, whose planting season is around July–August. A prolonged conflict would also have an impact on the later production of winter wheat. And if this conflict continues toward summer, you could expect a problem harvesting crops, even if they are planted.', 'But the impact doesn’t stop just at planting and harvesting. These commodities are bulky. The Ukraine–Russia region represents roughly 105 million tons of commodities. And we typically transport them via the Black Sea, via ships. Some of those ports have been damaged or are unable to operate. So you could also expect a logistics disruption that will not be fully absorbed by alternatives like rails and road.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Grains are global commodities, and in the US, we’ve already seen grocery prices surge during the pandemic. I would imagine the same is true in Europe. Should consumers expect to pay more for, say, a loaf of bread if these harvests are disrupted? Say more about wheat and why it’s so critical in the context of the global food supply.', 'Daniel Aminetzah: Wheat is a critical component of food security. Over 80 percent of wheat is primarily used for flour. And when you talk about a wheat price increase of more than 100 percent, which we’ve already observed in the last couple of years, you can translate this into [an increase in] basic bread prices, since wheat represents roughly 60 percent of bread’s raw-material costs.', 'Such a direct hit to the most important global supply hub of wheat has a clear link to food security. And bread is an important factor in social unrest in many emerging markets. Over a decade ago, for example, wheat prices were considered one of the main sources for the Arab Spring.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And vulnerable populations obviously suffer most when prices rise. We’ve already begun to see some unrest in a few countries—for example, in Greece, where farmers were protesting higher fuel and higher fertilizer prices a couple of weeks back. Speaking of which, Daniel, you mentioned a secondary effect involving access to fertilizer. Say more about fertilizer and how it matters within this global food ecosystem.', 'Daniel Aminetzah: Fertilizer is not just any input; it’s probably the most important input for farmers. NPK—the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the core components of fertilizers—played an integral part in the Green Revolution of the ’60s. That transformation spurred double-yield productivity over a couple of decades. It was one of the main drivers of population growth in the previous century.', 'And in today’s farmers’ lives, fertilizers are an essential part of ongoing operations—depending on the crop, roughly 30 percent of the overall cost of operations. It’s really hard to imagine a season for a farmer without fertilizers.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How important is the Black Sea region to fertilizer production? And what might a supply hit look like?', 'Daniel Aminetzah: Let’s focus on potash 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             A salt with high levels of potassium that is often added to fertilizers to improve the quality of crop growth.\\r               \\r \\r  and nitrogen, two out of the three main fertilizers. When it comes to potash, there are two major global supply hubs: one in Canada, and the other in Russia and Belarus. Russia and Belarus are very well organized and supply to key markets, like Latin America.', 'The situation has clearly led to a massive increase in the price of potash, which has more than doubled in the last couple of months. This will take time to address, given the relatively tight supply–demand balance in the world of potash. And the continuation of sanctions and logistics challenges could cause significant supply shortages and price increases in potash. Nitrogen is directly linked to energy. The energy crisis and current energy prices also have a direct effect on nitrogen prices and supply availability.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Nicolas, you mentioned earlier that all this is happening on top of an already tight food supply chain. Please say more.', 'Nicolas Denis: Between Q2 2020 and December 2021, the price of wheat went up 18 percent. We already had a food security issue well before the Ukraine–Russia crisis started. Now, the causes are multiple. There’s increased demand overall. A majority of those commodities go into producing protein, for instance. The increase in protein demand is driven by various parts of the world. We still haven’t solved issues like food waste: we waste 30 percent of our food.', 'On top of that, we’re starting to see some first impact of climatic events. Last summer, we had hard wheat. The [production of] durum used to make pasta, which is the basis of many people’s diets, was disrupted by a combination of a Canadian summer drought and a very wet summer in France. Our research has shown that those disruptions are supposed to multiply by four until 2050.', 'In combination with more expensive raw materials, such as fertilizer, a very tight food security situation has been created, starting well before this crisis began. The Ukraine–Russia conflict is hitting another level in the complexity of this food system.', 'In combination with more expensive raw materials, a very tight food security situation has been created, starting well before this crisis began. The Ukraine–Russia conflict is hitting another level in the complexity of this food system.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We seem to be talking about a convergence of relatively substantive disruptions. The media has been reporting on the potential for a global food emergency and an increase in global hunger. How concerned should we be?', 'Nicolas Denis: We should definitely be concerned. But the extent of that concern should be assessed in the coming weeks and months. What really matters is which of these milestones in the different breadbaskets—from preparing the fields to planting to harvesting—will be hit and which ones will be missed. We should also turn our attention not just to what is under the spotlight of the media today but to some of the secondary impact we could see.', 'Daniel mentioned the fertilizer situation in countries like Brazil. Suppose the conflict is prolonged and we see some potential disruption in the supply of fertilizer. Planting season in Brazil is around July–August, which means some of the inputs need to arrive a bit before. A prolonged conflict will have an impact on the next planting season for Brazil—and therefore will have a compounding impact on what’s ahead of us in terms of a food crisis.', 'We need to study and understand various scenarios and the reaction of some of the stakeholders, including governments, to determine the extent of our concern about the food crisis.', 'Lucia Rahilly: What’s our view on how the risks of this disruption might compare with previous food emergencies? For example, the global food crises of 2007–08?', 'Daniel Aminetzah: From a price inflation and cost inflation point of view, we see some similar patterns compared to both agricultural commodities and fertilizer prices from about a decade ago. The question at the top of all our minds is the longevity of this crisis and the ongoing effect it could have. Having such a hit in the middle of an inflationary environment, which further boosts inflation and shakes the supply chain, makes it difficult to predict where it’s going to lead, especially if you throw into the mix the geopolitical effects of these crises and related events that could follow.', 'Nicolas Denis: And we combine in this case not just a commodity shock like we had back in 2008 but also an input shock. We talked earlier about a shortage of potash, of other micronutrients we need. This combines two crises in one.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Acknowledging that the war is highly dynamic and that the outcome and longevity, as you said, remain unknown, would you give us a sense of what a limited-disruption scenario might look like?', 'Nicolas Denis: A limited-disruption scenario would have an impact until 2024. What it might mean in practice is that we potentially miss some of the planting season, but we manage to resume the season after. We would see limited sanctions, at least related to agricultural commodities and fertilizer, and relatively open use of commodities—countries not closing their borders and continuing to export to other countries.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And what about severe and extended disruption? We hope that doesn’t materialize, but what might it look like?', 'Nicolas Denis: In that case, we would miss several important milestones—several planting and harvesting seasons. We might also see the refugee situation worsen, which would mean less labor available in places where we need hands for agriculture. We could see an escalation of sanctions that at some point could also include some agricultural commodities. There might be several governments that stop exporting some of these commodities to countries that need them. That is a situation that could result in a significant decrease in global food trade. Certain countries would then need to rely much more on their own reserve amid a tight global supply.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Nicolas, you referred to trade protectionism. What about the converse? How might countries across the globe come together to compensate, at least for shorter-term supply shortfalls?', 'Nicolas Denis: Very short term, we have a few levers. Indeed, as you said, we could try to avoid some of the mistakes we saw ten years ago in the previous food crisis. Back then, we started to see some countries banning exports and therefore worsening the internal situation—farmers not having access to global revenues, countries not able to import. Limiting those trade restrictions is a way to come together.', 'Another is to reflect on the balance we have between food and fuel. Today, 18 percent of corn globally goes to fuel or biochemicals, so we could rethink that balance, at least for a brief time. And then we could also think about how we use some of the strategic reserve.', 'If we expand the horizon of what we can do, we might think about using fallow land, especially in Europe. We have set aside 10 percent, 15 percent, of fallow land for biodiversity purposes. We might temporarily get access to that.', 'Tracking and eliminating some of the waste, and rethinking our sources of protein, are also important parts of this. We know that red meat, white meat, and alternative protein are all options with different profiles in terms of the consumption of agricultural commodities. All those would be levers you could also use if you were to take a broader lens on time.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Daniel, how do you see the war in Ukraine changing the food and agriculture industry in the longer term?', 'Daniel Aminetzah: As we think about the food security situation, and if we link it to climate change, we expect this combination to further incentivize investments and behavioral changes across the board. On the innovation front, we’re likely to see much more focus by investors and other players on ag tech and food tech across biosolutions, alternative proteins, vertical farming, and many other segments.', 'We also expect to see a noticeable behavioral shift across all the key players in the system. Farmers will likely employ more efficient use of fertilizers and crop inputs, reducing waste and the like. Consumers might explore diet changes and alternative meats for consumption.', 'At a national level, we’ll see, hopefully, more attention to and acceleration of some transformations in key countries, especially emerging markets. One would hope that such a food crisis, linked to climate change, could result in a big acceleration in the global food system’s transition toward a much more sustainable model in the coming years.', 'While we encourage this acceleration, we have to continue to pay special attention to immediate needs and to food security, which we already see clearly emerging across Ukraine and Russia and which we’ve started seeing initial indications of across other emerging markets.', 'Nicolas Denis: Yes, there is a need to keep our attention on the most vulnerable people, for whom this crisis has significant impact on their access to food.', 'Senior Partner, New York', 'Partner, Brussels', 'Lucia Rahilly is global editorial director and deputy publisher of McKinsey Global Publishing and is based in the New York office.', 'Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is having deep human, social, and economic impact across countries and sectors.

Soaring food and energy prices. Supply chains at risk. Much is at stake as the war continues.,"['Lives lost and upended. Soaring food and energy prices. Supply chains at risk. Much is at stake as the war continues.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Sven Smit, senior partner and chair of the McKinsey Global Institute, talks with Lucia Rahilly, global editorial director, about some of the potential effects of ongoing war and uncertainty in Ukraine. This conversation was recorded on March 21, 2022. An edited transcript follows.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: I recognize this is a chaotic time for you, given the brutal effects of the war in Ukraine and ongoing shock and uncertainty, both in the European region and worldwide. We’re very grateful you were able to make the time to talk with us today.', 'Sven Smit: It’s indeed a complex time. I live in Europe, and this is so close that you can’t get it out of your heart. My mother is 80. She lived in Eastern Germany and fled from government oppression in the ’60s. She didn’t think she would live to see this again. And now it’s happening on our territory while we’re watching. This is a true atrocity and a humanitarian pain that’s unimaginable.', 'Lucia Rahilly: The war clearly affects all of us, but it must be particularly acutely felt in Europe, even outside the conflict zone. It’s the largest war in Europe in nearly eight decades. So I would imagine you’re hearing similar things from the leaders you talk to day-to-day.', 'Sven Smit: Yes. The pandemic is a virus. We can fight it with masks and vaccines. But in Ukraine, we’re fighting human against human—and that’s just so different.', 'Lucia Rahilly: This war is obviously causing massive disruption on a range of fronts. We can’t talk today about all of them, but let’s touch on at least a few. The foremost disruption, as you alluded to, is the horrific and rising toll on lives. What have we learned so far about the scale of this humanitarian tragedy—and about who is likely to bear the brunt of much of this suffering?', 'Sven Smit: At the moment, north of a few million people are moving out of Ukraine as refugees. That number could grow much bigger if the hostilities protract for the remainder of the year. Some people estimate it might then go north of ten million, 15 million. But there are different segments—the lives lost in the direct war, the displacement of refugees, and the displacement within Ukraine.', 'The energy and food crises are also pinching at the lives and livelihoods of people across the world. Among some less-well-off populations in Western Europe or the United States, energy and food make up 10–30 percent of what they spend. The price doubles, triples—all of a sudden, these people can’t do anything else but pay for food and energy. So you see some people already adjusting their behavior, eating less. And some of them just can’t pay.', 'Then you multiply that in a low-income country—one that maybe had an aspiring population, ready to go up the next step. Now these people get pinched by this increased price of food, increased price of energy, maybe even decreased access to food and energy. And you can easily imagine that more lives and livelihoods will be lost and disrupted outside the immediate conflict. We should not miss that. In the pandemic, there was a little bit of an under-told story: richer countries were really not paying enough attention to the pain of this economic disruption in lower-income countries.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Food prices spiked even prior to the war, given supply chain issues and rising energy prices during the pandemic. In the US, we saw grocery prices shoot up at the highest rate in something like 40 years. Do you see increased food insecurity in Europe—and potentially also an increase in world hunger—as a big risk as a result of this war?', 'Sven Smit: We haven’t yet seen shipments of oil, gas, and food stopping at a massive scale. There hasn’t been a major harvest disrupted in the northern territory, which could happen if this goes through the summer. We also haven’t yet seen some form of sanction or countersanction or hostility saying, “Let’s not ship the oil.” But if that changes, either by physical disruption or by intent, we may see problems with access.', 'At the moment, prices are rising in anticipation of potential shortages. And what will happen is high-income countries will buy—they’ll be able to pay. And lower-income countries will have access problems—or at minimum, even greater affordability problems.', 'Lucia Rahilly: In some lower-income countries, there is also a history of food shortages and rising food costs contributing to social unrest and uprising.', 'Sven Smit: That’s not just a risk in low-income countries. The yellow-vest movement reacted to an increase in diesel prices. Only a small increase in these items—which you need to buy to stay warm, to drive to your job, to earn an income—is very disruptive. It means you have to stop buying other stuff. And that’s where the pain comes. Of course, for some, that means not going on holiday—not the worst thing in life. But for others, it means cutting back on essentials because their spend gets crowded out by these enormous price rises.', 'We’re all experiencing just how sensitive a doubling of the price in oil or doubling in the price of food is to the spending patterns of the lower-income parts of the population. It’s very easy for higher-income people to say, “You know, this is part of the fight,” but it really pinches other segments of the population.', 'Prices are rising in anticipation of potential shortages. And what will happen is high-income countries will buy—they’ll be able to pay. And lower-income countries will have access problems.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Energy is obviously a huge disruption, given the role of Russian oil and gas not just in Europe but worldwide. I saw a quote a couple of days ago from the International Energy Agency warning that we could be headed into what they called the biggest supply crisis in decades. Sven, you’ve been so heavily involved in our energy research, including our recent report on the net-zero transition. Anything more to say about energy access, at least in the near to medium term?', 'Sven Smit: The first point is the energy is still flowing. But it could stop flowing. So we need to do much more radical things.', 'Currently, the energy policy of major countries is rotating: “Let’s build more wind. Let’s build more solar. Let’s build more nuclear.” It’s almost like saying, “Let’s try everything and find out what protects us the fastest.” What that does to net zero, what that does to the net-zero equation, I think we will only learn over time. Because the reality is that some countries might start reoperating coal plants as the fastest way to become somewhat less dependent. And other countries might actually finalize the wind farms that are already there.', 'For now, people are going to go all out. And then, at some point, we will resettle into a new equilibrium, which could go either way. For physical supply chains of energy that are now at stake, oil travels a little bit more on boats and can therefore be flexibly reallocated, while gas needs to be liquefied and then re-gassed. And the capacity for liquefication (SIC) and re-gassing is actually short. As a result, if we were to have a gas shortage, rebuilding might take a lot of time—much more time than we ever want.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Supply chain resiliency had already come to the fore as an urgent priority during COVID-19 lockdowns. And obviously, COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic issue, as we’re seeing right now in China and some parts of Europe. How much worse could this get?', 'Sven Smit: First, we need to reframe a bit what happened last year. The narrative was a broken supply chain—but the reality was an unbelievably strong supply chain. We had unprecedented levels of demand for consumer-goods purchases in the back half of 2021. And the supply chain actually delivered. The shelves were empty because everybody bought so much. A jittery supply chain could not have fulfilled this exceptionally high level of demand.', 'And why was there this demand? People were not buying services. They were not yet going on holiday, not going to the restaurants—which caused an enormous demand shift toward goods. Now, at least in the West, you can see a rotation back to travel and to restaurants and other activities that may ease the demand on products a little and also relieve some pressure on the supply chain.', 'But of course, if basic materials from Russia and Ukraine—food, metals, fertilizer—are not shipped, then that’s a problem. And some industries have important factories or important IT talent in Ukraine. If they can’t access them, their supply chains could be impeded again.', 'Every single company I work with is now asking, “What were we actually producing in Ukraine? Where did we get our nickel? Where did we get our cobalt?” And then trying to figure out what to do.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Acknowledging that the context is incredibly dynamic, let’s turn now to some of the ways this war might play out in the eurozone specifically, which is a very sizable macroeconomy and also very highly exposed. If hostilities were to be resolved diplomatically in the coming weeks, and we were to assume a modest policy response, what might the economic implications of this war be?', 'Sven Smit: We might hope for this to happen. If it did, for example, we at least would be unlikely to see a stop to the supply of energy and certain critical materials, which would help. And if a resolution were to happen quickly, the refugee situation might not be quite as big, and it would be a bit faster to rebuild some of Ukraine. In that case, maybe the first or second quarter of this year might look wobbly, and then we might emerge back to some form of normal trajectory. But of course, it could get worse if the hostilities are more protracted, the sanctions stay longer at much higher levels, and so on. Then we could easily be two, three years under.', 'We don’t, at this moment, expect the dip to be larger than the dip during the pandemic. The simple way to think about this is that COVID-19 created an enormous demand shock. That applied across all countries because we had lockdowns everywhere. Basically, because of this demand shock, aggregate demand fell.', 'Energy and food and the supply chain—these are very important. But even twice the price of energy is not a 10 percent GDP drop. That’s just how this translates. I’m not saying there’s no scenario imaginable where hostilities expand and you actually get a shutdown of the energy supply, in which case it could get much worse. But that’s not the scenario we’re talking about right now.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Say a bit more about what might happen if the war drags on.', 'Sven Smit: In that case, we would be a few years under with a few percent, and the question is, “How do we restore together?” Once a form of normality returns, you get a return to past growth. That depends a little bit on the energy mix. In a severe case, some stimulus to help the weakest get through will be important.', 'Once a form of normality returns, you get a return to past growth. That depends a little bit on the energy mix. In a severe case, some stimulus to help the weakest get through will be important.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Many economists expected 2022 to be the year the global economy bounced back after the shock of COVID-19. At the start of the year, we heard a lot of optimism about returning to prepandemic growth trajectories. All that very quickly changed following the invasion of Ukraine, and the economic outlook began to feel much more precarious. What can leaders expect globally, beyond the eurozone?', 'Sven Smit: The eurozone is far more directly affected. It has the highest dependency on Russian energy and some of the other supply chains. We expect the US to do better and China, probably even better, although China is still dealing with another wave of COVID-19, which could be a factor. But if you just look at the war in Ukraine, Europe will feel it the most, then the US, and then China.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Acknowledging variation among the leaders and organizations you work with, is there anything you think leaders can do right now to navigate the current uncertainty?', 'Sven Smit: I’ve spoken to maybe 100 leaders by now. Basically, they’re going back to the playbook of dealing with COVID-19, by setting up some form of a crisis team. And they all are, first, caring for their people, which they did during the pandemic, too. But in this situation, they’re asking, “Where are my people? Where are they in Russia? What can we do? Where are they in Ukraine? What can we do about that? Who else is affected more indirectly?” And then, in their crisis teams, they’re looking into, “Can we continue our operations given our dependency on Ukraine’s supplies and on Russian supplies?”', 'The next level is, “OK, how is this energy disruption going to hit me? These prices mean my products will be more expensive. What do I do? Does this mean people will have to spend more on energy—and therefore that they’re likely to spend less on my products?”', 'Leaders are translating the information coming in to model supply disruption for their companies. And they’re asking what it will do to demand, as well. As they start adjusting their strategies, I think they are also likely to start scenario planning. They’re asking, “What kind of storm are we weathering here and in what range?”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Sven, I’ve heard you say that the COVID-19 crisis actually helped revitalize the social contract by massively reinforcing the social safety net in places like Europe and the US, at least temporarily. How do you see the social contract evolving in the face of the war in Ukraine?', 'Sven Smit: During COVID-19, the level of support to those affected by the pandemic has been enormous. Of course, you can always debate specific points—for example, “Did it exactly land in the right place?” But we did help restaurant owners. We did help factory workers. We did help people who couldn’t work inside other people’s houses.', 'One way or the other, a significant amount of money landed in many places. This was the largest support action in a long, long time. We have increased debt-to-GDP ratios now, but in hindsight, people thought this was worth it. The alternative would have been much worse—mass unemployment, no support. So I think we have a lesson here.', 'And even at the beginning of this year, when we were cutting the supply of oil and gas for other reasons, prices went up. Italy and Spain talk about billions in energy support—or they decouple VAT [value-added] taxes for energy to slightly compensate for the blow of the energy price—hoping that it won’t sustain that long.', 'I also think we need to be careful not to be too light on how much these price increases can affect people. Some people say, “This is the energy crisis; we anyway wanted people to shift to alternatives. And this is exactly the right thing to help fight the battle.” That might be very easy to say if you have the money. But with the old prices, if food was 30 percent of your costs, that’s now 90 percent. And that means there’s nothing left.', 'That’s the pain that people feel. But as the pinch gets felt more directly, we’re already creating the kind of situation we’ve had during the pandemic. And clearly, we’re taking action because we recognize that this level of energy crisis and of food insecurity—it’s not a good way for people to live.', 'Lucia Rahilly: That’s very helpful, Sven.

To date, what we see is that the Earth has warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times. And with that warming comes everything from increased severity of flooding to increased prevalence of things like heat waves—a whole range of physical changes to the environment around us.', 'The net-zero imperative commitments that we’ve seen across companies and countries is to prevent the buildup of these greenhouse-gas emissions that are resulting in the warming of the Earth.', 'Roberta Fusaro: In your experience, which companies in which sectors are thinking about net zero the most?', 'Mekala Krishnan: We have seen net-zero commitments on the part of companies across many different sectors. There are certainly parts of the economy that contribute directly to greenhouse-gas emissions—things like the power system and the mobility and transportation system. There’s a whole set of energy and land use systems, ranging from power to mobility to industry, that all contribute directly to emissions.', 'Let’s take transportation and mobility as an example. That system is essentially composed of an entire set of sectors, an entire set of companies, and an entire set of countries, as well as individuals and consumers participating in that system.', 'Transforming and reducing emissions of that mobility system will involve the participation of automotive manufacturers, upstream suppliers, and downstream consumers. The reason I give this example is to say that, as we think about the transformation to net zero and the economic shifts that would involve, it is really a whole-of-economy universal transformation.', 'It is really across sectors that we’re starting to see companies engage in this debate. This could mean thinking about their own direct emissions—what is often referred to as Scope 1 emissions—or the emissions in their products, the emissions in their supply chains, or the emissions in the electricity they buy and consume.', 'Roberta Fusaro: The research says, “The transition will have universal, significant, and uneven effects across sectors, geographies, communities.” But at the same time, there’s the opportunity for growth depending on how companies approach it. I’d like to hear about some of those decision points. For instance, what are some of the questions that business leaders face in terms of strategy and growth?', 'Mekala Krishnan: Often, when people think about the net-zero transition, they start thinking about decarbonization actions. And that’s certainly the first and a very crucial part of the net-zero transition agenda.', 'Companies will need to think about how they can reduce their own direct emissions, their own Scope 1 emissions, and how they can reduce emissions in the electricity that they buy and consume, what are often called Scope 2 emissions.', 'And then [companies will need to think about] their own Scope 3 emissions, whether it’s automotive manufacturers thinking about the emissions of their products, or consumer goods companies that have long supply chains thinking about the supply chain’s emissions.', '', 'As you rightly pointed out, it is a much more holistic agenda than just decarbonization alone. Companies will also need to think about how they manage the risks that they may experience as the world transitions. So, for example, certain sectors that have high emissions may see lower demand for their products. They may see cost increases in certain areas. Accessing capital may become more challenging.', 'And we identify a whole set of opportunities in our research: entirely new markets that open up for low-emissions products under a net-zero world. So think markets for things like hydrogen, electric vehicles, solar power, and other forms of renewable-based power.', 'There’s also a whole set of opportunities as we think about the broader ecosystem that needs to be built around low-emissions products. These are things like markets for an entirely new set of raw materials and minerals that may be needed for the transition and entirely new supply chains that may need to be built up.', 'One of the things that we often say to companies is, “As you think about the net-zero transition, it’s certainly an important imperative to think about decarbonization actions, but it’s also about managing your risks and capturing opportunities.”', 'And [we also talk] a little bit about the buildup of physical risks: some amount of warming is almost guaranteed, regardless of what we do on decarbonization actions.', 'So along with thinking about the net-zero economy and the net-zero transition, companies will also need to think about the set of adaptation actions: things they need to do to manage the buildup of physical risks and the impact on their own business and operations as a result of that. It’s a much more holistic and broader agenda than decarbonization alone.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I think that’s a great distinction to make. Because when I hear folks talk about net zero and the transition, they are really focused on decarbonization without thinking about everything that cascades from that. What basic questions should leaders ask themselves as they venture toward net zero?', 'Mekala Krishnan: One of the ways we often talk about it is that the sustainability agenda actually needs to be the CEO’s agenda because of the breadth of business impacts that it has.', 'If I’m an organization that is navigating a net-zero transition, there are fundamental questions that it raises for me. Are there markets that I previously thought were attractive that are no longer attractive? Are there entirely new opportunities that are created as a result of the transition? What should my strategic posture be in a world where the pace of change, the nature of change, is still uncertain while we have a net-zero target, say by 2050 in many parts of the world? The exact pathway that’s going to take is still uncertain.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Earlier you mentioned risks. What should leadership be investigating around risks?', 'Mekala Krishnan: There’s a whole set of questions around risk management that [the transition to net zero] raises. How do I integrate both physical as well as transition risks into my approach and appetite for risk? It also raises a whole set of capital-planning and capital-allocation questions: Where do I raise capital? What is my cost of capital going to be, depending on the nature of my business?', 'Roberta Fusaro: What about operations?', 'Mekala Krishnan: There’s a whole set of questions [the transition to net zero] raises around operations. What should the nature of my operations look like? How do I most effectively decarbonize? Where does decarbonization raise costs? Where does it lower costs? Who are the suppliers that I do business with? One of the things that we highlight in the research is the breadth of business decisions that are changed as a result of a net-zero transition and moving to a net-zero world.', 'One of the things that we highlight in the research is the breadth of business decisions that are changed as a result of a net-zero transition and moving to a net-zero world.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I imagine leaders have to take a closer look at their talent and how to evolve it for a net-zero transition?', 'Mekala Krishnan: There’s an entire upskilling exercise that many organizations will need to undertake to navigate this transition successfully. Above and beyond that, when we then think about the implications for middle management and for upper management, I think these constituencies and companies in particular will need to upskill themselves to understand both the case for change and how their organizations are affected under a net-zero world so that they’re able to successfully navigate the organizations through the transformations that lie ahead.', 'Roberta Fusaro: You mentioned upskilling is necessary to support net-zero transitions. What are some companies doing in that regard?', 'Mekala Krishnan: What we see organizations starting to think about is almost university curriculum: What is the 101, the 201, the 301 set of skills that employees need? 101 skills are every employee having some degree of proficiency around what the imperative to get to net zero looks like and what the net-zero transformation entails.', 'Then we start to also see organizations think about: Do I understand the levers at my disposal in my organization to reduce emissions? Do I understand the relative costs of different types of levers? Do I understand how to interact with my suppliers? There’s both a set of basic knowledge that almost everyone in an organization will need and a set of function-specific know-how that we’re also starting to see companies start to internalize across different functions.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How should business leaders be thinking about risk differently in the wake of the net-zero transition?', 'Mekala Krishnan: With a changing climate and the net-zero imperative, it is important to recognize that there’s a whole set of new risks that companies will need to face, whether they are the physical risks from a changing climate or transition risks, which are risks that ensue as the world undertakes a net-zero transformation—much in the same way as cybersecurity risk, which was not on the radar of companies ten, 15, 20 years ago, but now is on every company’s radar. We’re going to see that happen, and we’re already seeing it happen with both physical risks and with transition risks.', 'Now, hand in hand with that will be the need to build an entirely new set of capabilities, infrastructure, and data to be able to assess these risks on the one hand, and then take steps to manage them on the other.', 'As a result of that, we think it’s important for all companies to develop the ability to conduct these scenario-based modeling exercises that allow them to understand how their organizations will be affected.', 'And as they build these capabilities to do scenario-based modeling, they need to take a probabilistic view of potential outcomes, how they may vary across sectors, across geographies, and how they may differentially affect their own businesses.', 'Now there is also rising momentum as companies measure their risks, to not just measure them but to also disclose them. There are efforts such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, [which are] guidelines for how companies should think about both measuring and managing their risks and which encourage companies to disclose them.', 'This will allow for better capital planning and better investment decisions and will also allow companies to benchmark their performance, their actions relative to their peers. Therefore, the hope is that it will only improve [companies’] ability to manage these risks.', 'Roberta Fusaro: As business leaders are also making the transition to net zero, how should they be thinking about capital allocation?', 'Mekala Krishnan: We use an external scenario from what is called the Network for Greening the Financial System. It’s a consortium of central banks that has created scenarios for the transition. We use that as an input to then quantify how much would be spent on physical assets going forward to 2050 to reach this net-zero [target].', 'What we’ve found today is that we’re spending about $5.7 trillion on these systems. But fast-forward to the transition, and we need to increase that spending from $5.7 trillion today to $9.2 trillion every year for the next 30 years.', 'There’s a substantial increase in spending, about $3.5 trillion, that would be needed to get us to net zero. Now, if we take another counterfactual, where we factor in things like the policies that have been already committed to today by governments; if we factor in things like income growth and population growth, which would contribute to increased spending, that $3.5 trillion reduces to $1 trillion.', 'There’s another aspect to it, which is what we call in the research “a reallocation of capital.” By that I mean today we’re spending about 70 percent of that $5.7 trillion on what I would call high-emissions assets.', 'For example, it’s the internal combustion engine–based car that you and I buy; it’s investments in fossil-based-power assets. If we are to get to net zero by 2050, 70 percent actually needs to go to low-emissions assets.', 'There’s not just a fundamental increase in capital that we need to undertake but also a reallocation of capital from high-emissions to low-emissions spending: things like electric vehicles [EVs] instead of internal combustion engine–based cars; or solar-based power instead of fossil-based power.', 'What our research also finds is that much of the spending that we need to undertake for the transition actually needs to happen not over 30 years but in the next ten years.', 'All of this has implications for when we think about how to deploy this capital effectively. It will mean that financial institutions have a crucial role to play in raising and deploying the capital that we need for the transition. But we also have to think about the role that entirely new financial products might play.', 'We’ve heard a lot of discussion about things such as voluntary carbon markets to raise some of the capital that is needed for the transition, new finance products that include instruments for negative emissions, special-purpose vehicles to allow us to ramp down high-emissions assets effectively, and things like green bonds. So there’s a whole range of innovations needed in financial products to allow us to send capital to the sectors and geographies where it’s most needed.', 'And we will certainly have a role for public finance. When we think about some of the types of investments we need, many of them are what would typically be considered “public infrastructure” investments: things like EV-charging infrastructure. Many of the technologies that we’ve talked about for the transition are still in relatively early stages and may need forms of guarantees to reduce their risks. And then, almost most important is the role for collaborative action between providers of capital and users of capital to allow for capital to flow effectively. So companies will need to work hand in hand with their investors to effectively communicate the decarbonization agenda that they are about to embark on and allow for investors to feel comfortable with the risk profile of their investments.', 'We’re starting to see some interesting models, where financial institutions are partnering with companies in the real economy to build an effective business case around certain types of decarbonization investments, and do that at a pilot scale before then scaling up across organizations.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there recommendations in the report about being part of a broader initiative? If you’re a single company, what do you need to do to collaborate in order for everyone to meet their net-zero goals?', 'Mekala Krishnan: Companies can think about collaborating with their suppliers. For example, if they need to transform their own operations through reduced emissions, this may involve changing the kinds of inputs they receive.', 'We’re also seeing really interesting efforts on the part of entire industry associations—companies across sectors coming together to identify net-zero initiatives.', 'It will involve establishing a set of best practices, for example around decarbonization. It will involve, in many instances, setting entirely new standards: What does “green steel” even mean? What does it mean, in a certain sector, to be “at net zero”? How do you effectively measure emissions? There are a lot of unanswered questions when it comes to how we actually measure and how we set standards. So industry groups coming together to do standard-setting is an important step.', 'The third kind of cross-industry—or cross-company collaboration within an industry—that is important is making investments in some of the technologies that we need for the transition. Especially in industries where some of the technological pathways are still uncertain, collaborations across industry to finance and fund R&D, as well as deploy capital, could become very interesting.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there key industry associations in this regard? Or does it run the gamut?', 'Mekala Krishnan: It varies across industries. Some industries tend to be more global in nature, others more local in nature. There are some examples in finance, for instance, where we’re starting to see collective commitments on the part of banks or investors to get to net zero.', 'We’re seeing commitments when it comes to the steel industry and collective platforms. We’re seeing this when it comes to hydrogen, where a group of companies have come together to think about a road map for hydrogen deployment. This is certainly an important direction to travel in.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How should business leaders talk about net zero with investors, employees, suppliers—any key stakeholders?', 'Mekala Krishnan: It’s important for companies to recognize that unlike other business decisions, the net-zero transition is one that will oftentimes require engagement with external stakeholders of a kind that is not typical. If we think about a company looking to reduce its emissions, they will need to collaborate with suppliers to reduce potentially upstream emissions, to change the nature of the inputs that they use. If they are looking to adjust their downstream emissions, they will need to make a clear case to their consumers for why a green product is a better product than a more traditional product. If they are to make the kinds of investments that we’ve been talking about in physical assets, they will need to engage with their investors.', 'Now, having said that, it’s very important for companies to recognize that this needs to be part of the CEO agenda, given the breadth of transformation that is needed and the range of functions that are affected as a result of the transition.', 'Second, as companies build this case for change, it’s important to recognize there are certain, what I call, “no regret actions,” and [it’s important] for companies to understand what those no-regret actions look like for themselves and communicate them effectively.', 'As an example, decarbonization actions that increase energy efficiency are no-regret actions. If there are actions everyone across the industry has committed to, a momentum in the industry, that may be a no-regret action for a certain company.', 'In other instances, companies will need to make decisions about what their strategic posture looks like. Do they seek to lead? Do they seek to follow? Do they seek to collaborate? These are very real strategic questions that companies are going to have to grapple with. And as they engage with the external world, they need to build a case for the type of strategic posture that they are taking.', 'Roberta Fusaro: You mentioned the need for the CEO to own the agenda. What is the easy first step that any executive could take?', 'Mekala Krishnan: The first step really needs to be building that understanding of how a net-zero world will affect the organization. Armed with that knowledge, CEOs and boards need to plan for the future. That will involve building some of the capabilities to do scenario-based risk assessments and opportunity analyses that we talked about earlier.', 'But that first step is really building the understanding of how an organization is affected by the transition and by physical risks, as well as an understanding of the role that the organization can play in contributing to a net-zero world: What is the scale of its own emissions footprint? And how can reduction of that emissions footprint best contribute to this net-zero world?', 'Roberta Fusaro: You speak to the need for companies to understand this larger role that they play. That’s why we’re glad that you could join us on the podcast today, to help us figure this all out. Thank you for joining.', 'Mekala Krishnan: Great. Thanks for having me, Roberta.', 'Lareina Yee: I was up really late one night in the office, and I had tons of PowerPoints around me, tons of Excel spreadsheets around me. The fluorescence of the computer was blaring in my face, and it was clear I wasn’t able to solve the problem. I just thought if I try harder, if I work harder, if I work a little later, I’ll figure this out.', 'I sat there way into the evening, almost torturing myself. It was as if I was back in grad school, trying to cram for exams or figure something out late at night. And I thought, “Gosh, this just can’t be so difficult. Why is it so hard?” At the end of the evening, I couldn’t figure it out. I went home feeling terrible about it and thought, “What am I going to do the next morning?”', 'I woke up the next morning. Obviously little fairies didn’t come and solve the problem for me. I walked to the office thinking, “I’m just going to have to go into the partner’s office and say I couldn’t figure it out.” A little of a tail-between-your-legs moment. So, I did, and I wasn’t feeling great.', 'I said, “I’m sorry, I haven’t been able to crack this.” And he sat down, pulled his chair over and said, “Let’s take a look at what you have.” And we walked page by page through it. And in that moment he did something so important, which is he realized that I was asking for help. And what I didn’t realize is that I needed help, and that the act of being vulnerable and saying you need help is actually when you start to crack the problem, so to speak, when you actually start to figure things out.', 'What I didnâ€™t realize is that I needed help, and that the act of being vulnerable and saying you need help is actually when you start to crack the problem.', 'I had forgotten the cardinal rule of how we work, which is we work in teams, we work together. I really just needed to drop that student mindset that I had to pass the test. So, he sat down, we walked through the materials, and of course, through working together, we figured it out. Then the other thing he did was later that week, he brought me to the client and said, “Hey, we’re having a little trouble with figuring this out. What do you think?” He was vulnerable in front of the client.', 'And I thought, “Oh my gosh, aren’t we always supposed to be super buttoned up and have four-levels-deep answers?” And what he showed me was, no you don’t. In fact, that actually is a stronger way to go in many cases. So we talked to the client about it.', 'And of course, by the end of the week, we had cracked the problem, or at least the thing that we were trying to figure out, which I can hardly even remember because what I remember now is the emotion of being there by myself, trying to do something. And then the much better experience of saying, “Look, I need some help.” And then getting that help and working together with the clients and the team members at McKinsey to figure it out.', 'Mekala Krishnan is a partner in McKinsey’s Boston office.

Here’s how to get it right.,"['McKinsey research shows that adoption of IoT technologies has increased exponentially the past five years—but successful implementation still eludes some. Here’s how to get it right.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partners Michael Chui and Mark Collins share their thoughts with Roberta Fusaro on the findings of McKinsey’s latest Internet of Things report, including how to successfully integrate IoT, the situations in which the most value is being created, and what companies continue to get wrong.', 'After, it’s expected a piece of space debris hit the moon on March 4, 2022. Hear about the implications of all the other pieces of space junk in orbit from McKinsey associate partner Chris Daehnick and podcast managing producer Laurel Moglen. The following transcript has been edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How do you define the Internet of Things?', 'Michael Chui: The Internet of Things, or IoT, is when you embed digital technologies into the physical world. For example, we’re seeing digital technologies embedded in cars and in buildings. You connect those physical objects through digital network connections back to computers, and that simply is it. That’s the Internet of Things.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Mark, compared with McKinsey’s previous research on the technology, what were some of the most surprising findings from the new IoT research? What were the areas where you found great uptake or where the use cases were more prevalent than in others?', 'Mark Collins: Looking at the settings or physical locations where IoT is deployed, of 99 individual cases, we found five represented 52 percent of the value in 2020. So a really big concentration in terms of where value is created.', 'The second thing that I found surprising is the massive growth of the connected home. Rewind the clock back five years ago, and the average American house had one connected device in it. We fast forward five years, and homes have over five connected devices on average.', 'This shift has been born in part out of real innovation in technology with smart speakers, as well as us being caught in our homes for the last two years because of COVID-19. We’re investing in the area around us, both to improve and make our lives easier.', 'Roberta Fusaro: You talked about how five areas accounted for more than half of the value that’s being generated. What are the other four areas where you’re seeing value created?', 'Mark Collins: Consumer applications is one of the fastest-growing areas, but it’s not the largest as we think about it overall. And so when we look at the largest overall, what stood out to us were use cases related to human health in hospital, acute-care, and residential-care settings.', 'Also, we saw growth in operations and optimizations. So, how can we really drive greater efficiency, greater efficacy? And that was across the settings of factories, cities, and work sites. We also saw a real excitement around human productivity in the retail setting to really enhance what the experience can be for shoppers while also enabling companies to optimize both their revenue growth and their cost price.', 'Michael Chui: One of the remarkable things we’ve seen is that companies are deriving value from using these technologies. Whether it’s in the factory, in healthcare, or in the automotive industry, we’re seeing more and more cases where real value is growing and being created.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there examples of companies that are truly getting the integration of IoT right?', 'Michael Chui: The World Economic Forum has identified a set of factories around the world that they describe as lighthouses. They are lighthouses in the sense that they are truly being forward-thinking in terms of the application of IoT within their factories.', 'For instance, they’ve deployed condition-based or predictive maintenance: rather than waiting for a tool in a factory to go down and bring down an entire assembly line, they’re continuously monitoring the performance of that tool so as to avoid unplanned downtime.', 'So that lowers cost in terms of the maintenance itself, but more importantly, you don’t lose the output of that entire line, which can be millions of dollars per day. And this is true in the chemicals industry as well.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I’m curious about one aspect of the consumer applications: It feels to me like one of the larger impediments to greater adoption is this privacy issue. How did that factor into the results of the research? And how can companies help resolve that tension?', 'Michael Chui: Privacy is absolutely a factor as we think about consumer preferences. And it’s one which has increasingly become top of mind as we’ve seen very public incidents over the last few years. Some companies make their value proposition based on privacy as they go forward. But what we also see is a tension for users because they want the convenience that many of these IoT devices can bring. They’re seeking to balance these trade-offs between privacy, ease of use, reliability, ease of installation, et cetera.', 'Some companies make their value proposition based on privacy as they go forward. But what we also see is a tension for users because they want the convenience that many of these IoT devices can bring.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What impact have you seen IoT have on cities?', 'Michael Chui: Cities are near and dear to my heart as a former municipal CIO [chief information officer]. One of the challenges that we’ve seen in a number of large cities around the world is the amount of traffic congestion in the center of cities.', 'A number of different cities have applied congestion pricing. They are tracking when vehicles are in the center of the city and charging for the times when congestion is highest. That doesn’t necessarily make the driver happy, but we have seen material changes in traffic patterns within those cities that have invested in congestion pricing. You can think about a city being like a dynamic, living organism, and IoT can help it adjust.', 'Mark Collins: Taking the example of the living organism, we’re seeing a real trend toward environmental, social, and governance [ESG] and sustainability right now. As someone who lived through the days of orange skies in San Francisco as a result of the fires a few years ago, I think we’re seeing real focus now on things like air quality monitoring and water quality monitoring.', 'We’re seeing cities intervene by deploying sensors to detect these things. We’re also seeing democratization of that with private individuals paying for sensors that tell them the levels of air pollution in their region. These sensors allow governments to think about their response to pollution. And that can feed into decisions, such as what factories are going to be opened, where they’re going to be opened, and what their hours are.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So those are areas that show high promise and high activity. What are companies still getting wrong about IoT?', 'Mark Collins: I think one of the big findings when we looked back, relative to the research of five years ago, was that now largely we can say the technology is actually good enough. We’ve had huge maturation in things like network connectivity, battery power, computer advanced analytics, et cetera. What we saw happen all too often was IoT being treated as a technology project, often run by the CIO or by a small business unit or factory plant all by themselves.', 'And so the technology has changed, but the actual way of work has not. When we look at some of the lighthouse factories that Michael referenced earlier from the World Economic Forum, we see that they treat the integration of IoT as a holistic operating model transformation.', 'When they look at how systems and processes are going to change on the factory floor, for example, they think about how they may need to motivate individuals working within that system differently. And then to support that, they think about what are the KPIs and reporting that you need to be looking at on a forward basis. And we find when you bring these operating-model factors together with some of the fantastic technology that you have today, you really can produce some pretty magical results.', 'Michael Chui: As a former CIO, I feel the technology leadership is still important, though. We just need to make sure we have business leadership, too.', 'Roberta Fusaro: That’s a good point, Michael. How should technology and business leadership be working differently to enable IoT initiatives?', 'Michael Chui: This is an old story. In any business application of technology, you need business leaders to partner closely with the technology leaders. To ensure smooth integration of IoT—because the technology has advanced a lot, you really need that coleadership.', 'At the end of the day, you need the business leader also to be able to say what’s being targeted, for example, “We’re going to target unplanned downtime. We’re going to target inventory management cost. We’re going to target our employees’ safety.” Whatever it is. That’s the business result you’re going for. Hopefully, the technology people are learning about that at the same time that the business people are learning about technology.', 'Mark Collins: To build off that, one of the themes that we heard in our client service is that the integration of IoT is often easier in greenfield settings. It’s easy to build in the technology and the business icons from the start, or if you’re a new IoT company being set up from scratch. Where we see this being a challenge is when you’re trying to integrate it into legacy or brand field environments.', 'And that’s not just the case of where you have a factory that’s 50 years old that suddenly needs to be connected to the internet for the first time, but it’s also in terms of companies that have traditionally sold unconnected products. How do they now move to a world which is much more software-driven, where they want to sell connected products going forward? In these situations, the connection between business leaders and technology leaders can have stunning results.', 'Roberta Fusaro:  What role does talent play in the way that IoT is being adopted? Or is it holding the technology back?', 'Mark Collins: We see talent playing an absolutely critical role. And it’s not just in terms of core academic disciplines, where there’s a huge need for talent such as data engineers, data scientists, computer scientists, et cetera, who underpin all of the operations of analytics and IoT.', 'We also see it in terms of ways of working. We see companies doing really well when they’re taking a design thinking methodology and working backward from their customers’ needs all the way through to how they deliver it.', 'As we thought about the implications for governments or regulators, one of the key reflections that we had is how do governments and regulators think about turbocharging the talent that is needed to unlock this potential going forward. And that’s going to require a whole raft of interventions all the way from primary and secondary and tertiary education through to thinking about skill development.', 'Michael Chui: Folks who know how to implement IoT and capture value from it in a business are in high demand. It is one of the bases of competition. And because IoT is not exclusive to the technology industry, you see automotive companies vying for the same talent as the tech industry.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What’s a typical example of some things that companies get wrong when they try to use IoT or implement IoT into their corporate strategies?', 'Mark Collins: What we sometimes see with large multinational companies that have global footprints is that there isn’t a clear owner of IoT within the organization. And that leads to fragmented and decentralized decision making when it comes to IoT.', 'I remember an example: I was speaking with a colleague about a company that had multiple factories across the globe. And almost every factory had a bespoke application, a bespoke vendor for providing one single discrete use case.', 'Each of them worked well in terms of their individual silos, but when it came to looking across the company as a whole, it was next to impossible to get an aggregate view across the entirety of the company. It meant as you thought about scaling those solutions, you were structurally limited and almost had to go back to the start and reengineer.', 'I see a real theme around who owns the IoT agenda, particularly from multinational companies, and how being thoughtful about the short term and the long term, at a global and a local level, will allow you to capture value.', 'We’ve seen lots of examples where people buy a new piece of technology and it’s used for the first week and then sits idle. And it’s through uniting the business side and the technology side and changing the day-to-day ways of working that you get to real change for companies.', 'The classic example that Michael and I often talk about are the repairers, who, until recently, were the heroes of the hour when they fixed the repair. In the future, the hero of the hour will be the person who makes sure the repair is never needed in the first place. And so, you need to think totally differently about the KPIs, the incentives, and the performance management of people on a very practical level.', 'Michael Chui: Another thing that companies get wrong is they don’t ensure that the machines they buy are connected to each other. A lot of companies that sell connected equipment to factories say that they’ll do predictive maintenance, but unless all of the machines talk to each other, you’re often going to underoptimize the performance of the whole factory.', 'When we did the analysis, well over 50 percent of the value that IoT can unlock requires interoperability. Unless the factory manager or the procurement manager specifies that connectivity and interoperability occurs, you’ll have IoT devices that don’t talk to each other.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What role do business ecosystems play in the changes you’ve seen? Is there more collaboration? Are these ecosystems bigger or better?', 'Mark Collins: I think ecosystems are absolutely critical as we think about the landscape going forward. And to give a very tangible example of this: One company I work with wants to deploy sensors within their production environment, and they want to make sure that those sensors are secure. Making sure those sensors are secure requires having security designed in from the start. How is the network on which those chipsets communicate information secured? In the servers where that data is stored, how do we ensure that they are secure as well? And so, no single vendor can secure an entire IoT value chain. Rather, we need people who work together to integrate almost each layer of the stack to bring this together.', 'We have seen the emergence of platforms that are at scale that everyone can integrate with. We have not seen that emerge in IoT as of yet. And the emergence of that through an ecosystem play or through some other play is an unlock that we would be excited about.', 'Roberta Fusaro: If we do this research again in another two to five years, what are some trends that you could imagine developing?', 'Michael Chui: We need our factories to be better performing. Look at all the supply chain issues that we’ve had. It has been, in some cases, a setting that ended up being slower growing than we thought back in 2015. At the same time, it actually is the largest potential source of value.', 'I’m not saying IoT can solve all of the problems, but if you have better visibility in your supply chain, if you have the ability to ramp up and down in volumes in your manufacturing, we can have a much more resilient and productive economy.', 'Hopefully, we will be able to manage the next pandemic, which I hope is a long way away, by better understanding how public health is doing and how we are all individually doing. Hopefully, our homes will become more energy efficient.', 'Mark Collins: We wrote this report in the middle of a pandemic. In many cases, the world is different now than when we started writing this report 18 months ago.', 'One CEO referred to there being a decade of progress in digital transformation in under ten months. And so, I think about how many of my clients are now achieving things at a speed that they would never have thought possible in equivalent time frames before. I also see the ambition levels increasing as they think about what they want to do, how they want to link the physical and digital worlds together and make concerted investments in things like digital twins and other technologies that not only would enable them to be better prepared for the future but also enable them to capture value and serve their customers better.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What is one key takeaway you would offer business leaders to accelerate their adoption of IoT?', 'Michael Chui: I’d say, bring all of the innovation that you have in digital to the physical world using IoT. It turns out that to transform your business, you actually have to do a lot of things. It doesn’t come down to one thing. That’s what we’ve discovered. And so you really have to bring the whole playbook if you’re actually going to transform using IoT.', 'Mark Collins:  For me, it would be about thinking about how to start to sell and deliver outcomes versus technology.', 'Roberta Fusaro: In the research, you say, “Don’t dip your toe in the water.” What does that look like if you’re an executive and you’re maybe a little bit hesitant?', 'Mark Collins: Doing more things together means that you force change. And so, in the research that we’ve done every year, we’ve seen that those companies that deploy more use cases together in parallel consistently capture more value per individual use case. And that’s because you force the rethink around your operating model, processes, incentives, and reporting. And it really serves as an unlock for the company.', 'Companies that deploy more use cases together in parallel consistently capture more value per individual use case. That’s because you force the rethink around your operating model, processes, incentives, and reporting. And it really serves as an unlock for the company.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What does it look like to deploy multiple use cases?', 'Mark Collins: Multiple use cases may be occurring, but they may be occurring from different perspectives on different systems in different areas. And that’s why I think it’s so important to think about who is the IoT champion within your company. Who is the person that’s going to take on this mantle and lead forward? Because just by the act of appointing someone as the lead, you automatically enable greater coordination and greater visibility, which, as we’ve seen in our research, gives you a multiplier in terms of the outcomes you get.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What role could IoT play in fostering the metaverse or challenging the metaverse?', 'Michael Chui: First, I want to recognize that there are a number of different opinions on what the metaverse is. So it’s hard to come up with a definitive answer that matches everyone’s definition. We tend to exclude user interface devices as part of the IoT, but nevertheless, those things are, from a very practical standpoint, metaverse related.', 'Mark Collins: Think about how you can create almost near-perfect replicas of things like telecom networks or electricity networks or factory floors, where you can trial and test and get real-time feedback.', 'Sensors and IoT devices within these environments will provide the information to enable those digital twins to run in real time and give you the ability to think about how you can optimize. And these deliver benefits not just in terms of cost opportunity savings optimization but also in terms of situations such as telecom networks in the face of mass weather events when cell towers are falling over.', 'Michael Chui: If you have a digital twin of a factory and you can go into the factory and simulate what the operators might be able to do, you can start to train and you can start to optimize all those sorts of things.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Before we sign off, is there anything that you wanted to touch on that we’ve missed?', 'Michael Chui: One of the other settings that I’m excited about in which these technologies could be deployed is worksites. Productivity in construction has actually declined slightly over several years.', 'We badly need to do things such as building more housing. The hope is that IoT and other practices can improve the productivity of things like construction. That would be incredibly beneficial, not only to our economy but also for people.', 'Mark Collins: Michael, with you taking the efficiency angle, let me take the efficacy angle for a second. We spoke earlier about the impact of COVID-19 on the deployment of IoT. One area that has foundationally changed forever is the provision of healthcare.', 'The pandemic has reset how we interact with our healthcare providers. We’re now in a world where the default is, “I’ll engage with my primary care over unified communications (UC) or over my phone through videoconferencing. No longer am I going into a clinic or waiting room.”', 'If you think about what IoT is enabling off the back of that, it’s the ability to do diagnostic tests that were previously only possible in acute-care settings. Now, suddenly, I can do these with a wearable on my wrist and be done in 30 seconds. If I think about the potential for that not just to improve wellness but also for patients with acute and chronic diseases, it can make a real difference in terms of both quality of life and also detecting potential disease or deterioration earlier—helping to prolong life as well as expanding its quality.', 'Laurel Moglen: At the time of this recording, a piece of space debris is expected to hit Earth’s moon—if it hasn’t already.

Chris says those pieces are—', 'Chris Daehnick: Roughly the size of a softball.', 'Laurel Moglen: What about the number of pieces that are not traceable?', 'Chris Daehnick: Several hundred thousand pieces, or at least a large multiple of the 27,000, are untraceable.', 'Laurel Moglen: What exactly are those thousands of pieces of junk?', 'Chris Daehnick: Space junk starts with pieces of rockets or old satellites that have outlived their usefulness. Everything from things that have fallen off the International Space Station, or the Space Shuttle in the past, or other spacecraft. In a few cases where someone has intentionally destroyed a satellite with an antisatellite weapon, that creates a huge amount of additional junk. You have things like paint flecks. There’s even an astronaut’s glove floating around out there.', 'Laurel Moglen: A paint fleck here on Earth is pretty innocent, but in space, it’s a projectile that packs a punch.', 'Chris Daehnick: Somewhat notoriously, one of the space shuttles got a chip in one of its windows. It was a noticeable defect in the window when it came back to Earth. But didn’t cause any greater damage.', 'Laurel Moglen: But greater damage is a possibility if space pollution increases?', 'Chris Daehnick: There is the potential over the long run that if you have enough pieces of junk in orbit and they begin to collide with each other, you could have almost a chain reaction.

NASA has proposed some standards. I think it’s safe to say there’s interest from any space-faring nation. This is a common problem.

Paying attention to customer reviews will give organizations a necessary edge.,"['COVID-19 has made e-commerce more competitive than ever. Paying attention to customer reviews will give organizations a necessary edge.', 'McKinsey research has shown that peer purchasing insights seem to have more influence on consumers than any marketing strategy. In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Roberta Fusaro speaks with McKinsey partner Dave Fedewa and McKinsey senior expert Chauncey Holder to understand how and why businesses must prioritize customer reviews—or risk falling behind agile competitors. After, meet Princess Daisy Akita, a mathematician, lawyer, and currently an early-tenure consultant at McKinsey. The following transcript is edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is hosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Chauncey, Dave, thanks so much for joining us today. Online ratings have been with us for a long while, but why are they more important now than ever before?', 'Chauncey Holder: COVID-19 is the short answer. COVID-19 essentially forced the trial of a number of new categories, and consumers had no choice in the early part of the pandemic but to trial e-commerce as a channel. And surprisingly—or not—they liked it.', 'When consumers have essentially transparent information about the product that they’re purchasing, it gives them permission to trial as much as they want across the category, right? You don’t have to rely on brand. And so really what you do is you get similar products at roughly the same price point, and now it’s just a matter of ratings and reviews.', 'And some of our proprietary research has suggested as much—that the increases in e-commerce penetration due to COVID-19 are not likely to recede or regress to prepandemic levels, which means that particular behavior has been adopted widely by consumers.', 'Dave Fedewa: I think the total number of global reviews something like doubled in the year after COVID-19 started. And so when you think there have been ten years of reviews before that, that’s a lot of reviews in a very short period.', 'I think that pace may have slowed some, but it hasn’t gone backward. I think everybody’s realized this is an easier, more convenient, and, frankly, more transparent way to shop, and I’m not going back.', 'The second really interesting thing, which is frequently overlooked, is how reviews affect offline shopping at a traditional brick and mortar. And I think that has also increased substantially. It’s a little bit harder to measure. But just think about the last few big purchases you made. You started that process online. You may have ended up in a store to finish it, but you started that process online. And probably, if you’re like me, you’ve been in a store and flipping through your phone recently, right?', 'Roberta Fusaro: Exactly.', 'Dave Fedewa: Like, I’m not buying this thing until I read a few reviews.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I’m curious, then, what would you say affects consumer’s purchasing decisions more, these online reviews or companies’ marketing campaigns?', 'Chauncey Holder: We are in a fundamental paradigm shift. But I’m not sure how much practitioners appreciate the tectonic shifts that we are going through at the moment. So, if you think about it, the pandemic has accelerated a fundamental change in consumer behavior.', 'Going solely into the store and observing what’s on the shelf or any traditional marketing lever—such as the power of the brand, the availability in the store, or some sort of in-store promotion—that’s the old world. If you’re a consumer and your choice is to either put more weight on a signal that the marketer is giving you or more weight on the signals that actual consumers who are using the products are giving you, well, which one do we think most consumers will eventually default to? And we are absolutely seeing that.', 'Going solely into the store and observing what’s on the shelf or any traditional marketing lever—that’s the old world.', 'Dave Fedewa: That’s a great question. I don’t know if that’s one you could ever answer quantitatively, at least at a macro level. But I think that, for sure, as Chauncey said, the product is becoming the marketing.', 'In the world before reviews, you needed the marketing to tell you what the product was like, and you needed the brand to give you confidence that “I know the other things that I bought that had this name on it were good, and so this next one should be good.” And quality was a much longer play, longer game, and longer bet. Brand building was a very long game.', 'And what you’re seeing as a result now is new brands disrupting spaces that had been held by longstanding brands—as this new kind of dynamic plays very well to the disruptor in that sense. The other thing to say, even though it’s a little bit crass [laughs], is you can’t polish a turd. We came across an example recently where a company was paying a reasonable amount for the online promotion of a product. And when you click through the product, it’s rated 3.8 stars.', 'There’s no point marketing a product that isn’t good, or there’s less and less a point in doing so, because you can’t hide it. So, in a way, you’ve got to fix the product regardless. I’m sure there are lots of different ways to get awareness out there. But it’s absolutely table stakes now to have a great product.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there particular product categories where this dynamic is particularly taking hold? For example, I feel really connected to a certain product versus the toilet paper I buy. Is that what’s going on here?', 'Chauncey Holder: Absolutely. The way that I’m currently thinking about what categories are more susceptible to these disruptions is by thinking about the category along a couple of dimensions.', 'The first dimension is what is the fundamental benefit or equity that this product is delivering to the consumer? Is it essentially just a functional attribute? Take, for example, a storage container. You know it does a job, and it needs to do the job well. But that’s really the only benefit that it’s delivering. At the other end of that spectrum, you have product categories that deliver some sort of emotional and tangible equity—for instance, product categories for newborns. And it stands to reason that the amount of research and investment that people would do at the end of those spectrums would differ wildly.', 'The other lens that I think about is in the competitive landscape. Maybe 15 years ago, if you wanted to build a new product and sell it in the US market, one of your biggest challenges would be how do I get inside large brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart and Target or Home Depot and Lowe’s.', 'That type of barrier is nil today. So, any enterprising overseas entrepreneur who has some manufacturing and design capabilities can purchase products, tear them down and reverse engineer them, and essentially knock them off and put them online faster than ever—and with very few barriers.', 'And now you pair that with a post-COVID-19 purchasing population that is more willing than ever to try new things, and then you find yourself with a whole bunch of product categories that are highly susceptible to being disrupted in this new environment.', 'We did a study where we were looking at the landscape online for a particular product. And we came across an insight that we were not looking for and had not expected. Essentially, in the past two or three years, the number of SKUs available for this product on Amazon quintupled. There was a four- or fivefold increase in the competition online. And what was even more breathtaking about that was the client didn’t know.', 'Dave Fedewa: I think the other compounding factor in all this is that the supply chain is really hard right now, and there are a lot of products out of stock. And so one of the biggest drivers for switching is an out-of-stock product.', 'I need product X, the one I usually buy isn’t there, what else is here? I’m going to try something else because I need it today. And so you put all that together with great reviews and everything else, and it’s all up for grabs.', 'To the question, one macrolevel view of which categories this matters the most for obviously depends on price point. If I want to spend a lot of money, I’m going to research it, right?', 'The second factor is emotion, to Chauncey’s point. Take, for example, baby car seats. We conducted some research: baby car seats are one of the most sensitive things when comparing the relationship between growth and star rating. You can just imagine the conversation: “Honey, I think the 3.8-star car seat should be fine, and it’s $50 cheaper. Are you cool with that?” And just imagine the response you’re going to get. Now, it depends on whether it’s your first kid or your third kid probably a little bit, but—', 'Roberta Fusaro: Exactly.', 'Dave Fedewa: The third factor I’d say is that even if it’s not expensive or something I’m emotionally wrapped up in, how much of my life is going to be tied to this? And we looked at this in home improvement, and some of the ties came out surprising. Things such as deck screws or a low-cost toilet valve or something, right? And it’s like, holy cow, it matters a lot. The star rating really matters a lot in these categories. And for a minute there, I thought, “Is this right?”', 'But then what you start to realize is that someone’s going spend an hour or two of their Saturday, or maybe a lot more, and yeah, it’s only $5 or $10 or whatever, but they care that they don’t want to do it again for a long time. And so, even in lower-price-point items, it matters.', 'Roberta Fusaro: You wrote an article recently for McKinsey on how to take online reviews in hand and figure out how to improve the design of your products as a result. What sort of base technical capability do you need to establish to analyze reviews to get the insights that you need to make these differences in your product categories?', 'Chauncey Holder: The good news is that it’s neither very complicated nor very sophisticated. Primarily it’s called natural-language processing, or NLP—and that’s using machine learning and, maybe to a lesser extent, artificial intelligence. We crawl websites so that we harvest the consumer reviews, which are publicly available.', 'And then the natural-language processing takes these reviews—which, in the industry, are called unstructured text—and it does two things. It clusters the reviews into themes, and those themes are usually very product-attribute related because of the nature of the reviews. And then, it can take that large data set of unstructured text and cluster it into product attributes, and it can assign a positive, negative, or neutral valence to a given review.', 'And the output of that is an attribute taxonomy that is essentially from the mouths of the users, and a performance metric, which is your ratio of positive to negative reviews for a given SKU or brand on a given product attribute. So you get a highly actionable diagnostic tool simply by using natural-language processing.', 'Dave Fedewa: The secret to having a successful product business hasn’t changed for hundreds of years. It’s iteration, right? Get a product out there, and you obviously start with prototypes and what’s not working. You fix that. But then once you get it out in the market, you’ve got to continue that, right?', 'And I think you could take every successful company and say that they’re doing a good job with that. You could take a lot of unsuccessful companies and say they lost that somewhere. They didn’t keep improving, and they lost their edge. Elon Musk actually captured this really well recently in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.', 'They were asking him about innovation, and he was in front of a bunch of CEOs. And they asked, “What would you tell this group about innovation?” And his answer was along the lines of, “I would tell them it’s not actually that much about innovation. Instead, I would say it’s about asking yourself is my product as awesome as it could be? And the answer to that’s probably no.”', 'It’s really easy to go out and find out what’s wrong with your product—what people don’t like about your product and how you compare by attribute to your competitors. And most importantly, what are the most important attributes? What do people care the most about? And then conduct an analysis of the things that people are least happy with about the product to help prioritize what you need to fix first.', 'The next problem with that is, OK, I know what I need to fix, but it costs money, right?', 'Now we can be reasonably scientific about that. And so the beauty of that is now I can build a business case for the cost required to fix the top three issues with my product and be pretty confident about the corresponding growth that’s going to come from that fix.', 'Chauncey Holder: I would just say on top of all that, the dynamic in the marketplace is such that the length of time that you have to do those iterations is smaller than it’s ever been and will only continue to decrease because of the ease of entry for competitive products.', 'And that’s the bad news. The good news is that ratings and reviews as a source of consumer insight are nearly real time and—relative to other traditional marketing research techniques—very, very fast and very inexpensive.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Can either or both of you provide examples of companies that have used these online ratings as an asset and took input from consumers and somehow improved their product?', 'Dave Fedewa: One example in home improvement is outdoor lighting. There was a product where part of the value proposition of it is that even when you walk up to it or if it senses any motion, it kicks on, or it gets brighter. And there was an issue with that product where that wasn’t happening on a consistent basis.', 'As you can imagine, if somebody spends a few hours on a Saturday putting one of those up, and then they bring their family and say, “Hey, watch this thing work,” and then they walk up to it and it doesn’t work, they’re not going to be happy. In that particular case, the company went through the effort to make it better and redesign it. And they saw substantial growth in sales as a result.', 'Chauncey Holder: I think we have a case study on this brand that originated as a generic brand selling flashlights and software peripheries—such as cables and mice—primarily on Amazon. And they were really pioneering in how to come in and disrupt the marketplace and how to meet consumers on their own terms and figure out how to leverage these dynamics. They were one of the first companies or brands that would mine reviews extensively on their products, not only to make product improvements, but also to quickly get out in front of dissatisfied customers who were leaving reviews and course correct that.', 'One of the things that we’re seeing is that successful entrants in these online marketplaces are the ones who are the most responsive to the reviews, who are most proactive in soliciting reviews, and who are doing the best job at what I would call online-marketplace hygienics. And we’re seeing that many incumbent brands are not keeping up with the basic hygienics of how to market your products in these marketplaces.', 'But this particular example has done so well online and at Amazon that you can also find them in some brick and mortars now. And it all is because they were taking the feedback that consumers were giving them and improving their products iteratively over time. Simple as that.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about what companies can do to make sure that consumers’ expectations match the actual product that they’re buying. How can companies clean up their language to create that dynamic?', 'Dave Fedewa: So first, be clear about your product and what it is—and in some cases what it isn’t. We were looking at a brand of salsa the other day that proclaimed to be a spicy salsa. When we went through the reviews, it was very clear it was not spicy; it was mild.', 'So that’s easy to fix: just call it the mild salsa, right? Or you can reformulate and make it spicy. But call it what it is so you don’t disappoint. There’s not a lot of science behind that. And now it’s very easy to find those cases and address them. It happens all the time.', 'Second, be aware not only of the product and its performance but also of what the experience is going to be like and what it’s going to take—with home improvement, for example, that could be ease of installation or instructions. The two words, “No tools,” are really powerful. It’s not necessarily the first thing you’d think to call out on, say, a desk, but to be able to say, “No tool assembly” on a desk is a big deal.', 'If someone might think they’re going to get something out of a product that they’re not, you’ve got to be very clear about that. Because it’s going to come back. It’s going to return. We haven’t talked about that, but that’s a huge piece of the economics here. Returns are way higher online. So don’t be shy to say, “It’s this and not that. And if you want that, that’s a different thing.” And by the way, that’s probably another SKU you should have. That’s an upsell.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Dave, you mentioned how it’s easier, or maybe more common, for companies to make the business case for how to move budget around to prioritize product improvements. I wondered if you could talk a little more about how companies should think about doing that.', 'Dave Fedewa: I think there are a couple of different levels to it. You start at a macro level and say, “Across my whole portfolio of products, where do I have the biggest star-rating growth opportunity?”', 'And that’s something again that’s easy to do, right? I can go scrape all of the star ratings for a company’s entire portfolio, and then do the same thing with their competitors, and break it down by major category for the company and say, “OK, in which of these categories are you leading versus lagging behind your competitors?”', 'And which ones, frankly, are you lagging behind in the most? And then let me also stack that up against how much revenue each of these categories drives. And then use a little bit of the science and research that we’ve done and say, “OK, so what is the percentage growth opportunity by category based on my star-rating gap?” It’s not decimal point accurate, but it’s a really nice way to ask, “What are the first three categories I should probably start using this thinking on where I’m going to get the most growth?”', 'And you can even size it. You can put a dollar number on it. And we’ve seen dollar numbers in the hundreds of millions because fairly frequently we’ll see percentage increase numbers of 30 to 50 percent—going, for example, from a 4.2 to a 4.5, depending on the category, is worth a lot of growth. So that’s first at the macro level: if, say, this is worth $500 million in growth to my company, then I’m ready to probably dedicate some resources and tools to that growth, right?', 'The next thing is to determine on which three categories do you use this thinking? Then, we move to the micro: Inside these categories, which SKUs have the biggest opportunity? And then the question becomes, on those SKUs, what are the three or four or five attributes that I need to fix first?', 'And I can get that too—I take all the negative-sentiment comments and do an analysis. And then maybe issue number one is the instructions. All right, I can fix that. I need better instructions. Let’s get somebody on that. We know that’s worth a lot of money.', 'Issue number two could be that I’m calling it spicy instead of mild. So let’s go fix that, right? Issue number three might be more complicated. Maybe I’ve got a strength problem, and I need a different alloy. But I can make the business case for that and see that if I fix that problem, here’s what I’m going to get in terms of growth and incremental margin. So I’ve got cost and benefit. They’re very straightforward.', 'Roberta Fusaro: That sounds great; it’s a very systematic approach. Is the growth and volume of online reviews and their increased importance here to stay?', 'Chauncey Holder: A hundred percent.', 'Dave Fedewa: No one’s going to trade a more time-consuming, less transparent, in-store-only experience for a less time-consuming, more transparent, online experience.', 'For a long time, it was, like, well, I’ll do it with toothpaste, but I don’t know about a grill, right? And then, well, I’ll do it with a grill but maybe not a refrigerator. And then, well, I don’t know about a car, right? And now, more and more, it works for everything.', 'No one’s going to trade a more time-consuming, less transparent, in-store-only experience for a less time-consuming, more transparent, online experience.', 'Chauncey Holder: It really does. There was an article in the New York Times recently. There’s an online auction marketplace for vintage cars and enthusiast vehicles. Prepandemic, most of their auctions were $20,000 to $50,000 automobiles.', 'Postpandemic, they’re able to auction vehicles anywhere from $400,000 to $1.5 million dollars. And it’s completely virtual. People are willing to do a $1.5 million transaction for a product that they will not physically touch or examine. Now, if that doesn’t bring into sharp relief a fundamental shift in consumer behavior across the board, I’m not sure what else would.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thank you, Chauncey and Dave, for joining us.', 'Dave Fedewa: You’re welcome. Super fun conversation.', 'Chauncey Holder: Been a pleasure.', 'Princess Daisy: I’ve been at the firm for almost a year, and it feels like, “Oh my God, how could I have done so many different things in so many different contexts?”', 'Before McKinsey, I had just finished a JD and taking the bar exam, and I was very much in the space of lawyer thinking: super detail-oriented. Lawyers go into work looking for periods and commas. Coming here, I experienced a slightly different value paradigm, harking to the 80/20 principle, where the first 20 percent of your effort can give you 80 percent of the value.', 'And that has really reinforced the idea that sometimes, it’s good to refine an answer over and over, but oftentimes, there’s also value in going with your gut, seeing what the data tells you at the very beginning, and seeing what story you can build from that.', 'I grew up in Ghana. I lived in Ghana until I was about 17 and then moved to the US for the last two years of high school. I studied applied math during my undergrad, and I really liked the very precise, very quantitative nature of that. Fast-forward, a few years later, I was in law school, which is like the exact opposite of that: very meeting heavy, very qualitative.', 'So I thought it was fantastic that consulting existed—and I could leverage data in a way where storytelling counted—and allowed for the bringing together of those quantitative and qualitative interests. Frankly, I can’t think of many careers where I can build all of that into a single job on a day-to-day basis, and then still get to do tech work, which I think is really interesting. So I think that consulting is great for people who have a ton of interests.', 'Most of my studies have been in the SHaPE Practice, which is the Social, Healthcare, and Public Entities Practice at McKinsey. There’s a lot under that umbrella—we work with clients in the healthcare space, and also federal, state, and local governments.', 'I do feel that there is a sense of possibility, and there’s a sense that if you can envision something, if you can build a compelling case for it, there’s runway for you to bring that to fruition.', 'My first SHaPE experience was related to COVID-19. We were working with a state government to try to roll out vaccination across the state, which, as you can imagine, was incredibly exciting and incredibly impactful and intense because we needed to make sure our state partners were ready and able to get that vaccination machine up and running.', 'There were more than 30 people doing work on aspects of the same topic. And if you think about it, these are 30 people who are thinking and breathing the very same problem and making sure that everybody is on the same page and that we are continuously aligned about what the goal is. And this was a rapidly evolving situation, not to use that term loosely, but it was rapidly evolving, and so you need to be educating and re-educating the team. And that absolutely will remain a hallmark of my McKinsey experience.', 'I do feel that there is a sense of possibility, and there’s a sense that if you can envision something, if you can build a compelling case for it, there’s runway for you to bring that to fruition within the firm. One thing I really appreciate about McKinsey—and this is in contrast to some of the other consulting firms—is how much agency you have over what work you do. You’re able to select which study you’ll end up working on. So for the next three months, you’re thinking about this problem. And if this problem, and this group of people, feels inspiring to you, you get to follow your heart. And you do that over and over again. And, eventually, you build a McKinsey experience, and you build a life that you can appreciate, and you can celebrate in the day-to-day.', 'Princess Daisy Akita is a consultant in McKinsey’s Southern California office; and Dave Fedewa is a partner in the Atlanta office, where Chauncey Holder is a senior expert.

In this podcast, we explore Omicron\'s impact and whether an endemic is in sight."", \'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Shubham Singhal, senior partner and global leader of McKinsey’s Healthcare Practice and Public Sector and Social Sector Practice, shares his expert thoughts with Lucia Rahilly, global editorial director, on the impact of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, telltale signs of an endemic, and how business and society must continue to adapt. After their conversation, we hear from Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and author who says when it comes to the environment, there’s a case for hope. The following transcript has been edited for clarity.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Shubham, welcome to the podcast.', 'Shubham Singhal: Thanks, Lucia. Glad to be here.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s start with a little bit of context on why the Omicron variant seems to move so staggeringly quickly.', 'Shubham Singhal: The Omicron variant has a few important characteristics that makes it spread so fast. First, it actually evades prior immunity. The mutations were enough that even if you have a vaccine or if you’ve had prior infections, it evades that. That means that many more people will get the infection and are not immune to it.', 'The second part of it is it is more transmissible. Even if you have a mild infection, you can spread it to others. That’s why we see this very, very rapid increase in the number of cases.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And is that a typical trajectory for virus variants?', 'Shubham Singhal: In general, for a new variant not to emerge but to take hold, it has to out-compete the dominant strain. The way it out-competes is by spreading faster. So, yes, that is the natural trajectory. That doesn’t mean that every variant that emerges is going to be more transmissible, but the one that takes hold is more transmissible just by definition.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We heard a lot about herd immunity at earlier stages of this pandemic. What do we expect there?', 'Shubham Singhal: I think early on there was hope that, particularly with vaccinations and also by prior infection, we could get to herd immunity in a sense that we would be immune from further infection.', 'There’s general consensus today that we’re unlikely to reach that. Just take Omicron, for example. If it can evade immunity as a new variant, then it’s really hard to say we can get to herd immunity. If a virus will break through, there is no real definition of herd immunity.', 'The consensus is that COVID-19 will become endemic from the pandemic, which means that we will live with it like we do with the flu without as grave consequences as today.', 'Lucia Rahilly: So many of us who were hoping for that hard stop have to recalibrate now toward endemicity. How do we know when we’re in an endemic phase?', 'Shubham Singhal: It is not a light switch event to get to an endemic phase, because it is as much about the behavior and psychology that we all exhibit as it is about the epidemiology of the virus itself. So what do I mean by that? A few things will have to be true. We will have to have a level of disease burden—let’s think about deaths and severe disease, which gets to a level where we’re not overwhelming the healthcare system or having very large numbers of fatalities.', 'This is where, for example, Omicron has given some hope because it is a less severe strain, which has now taken hold. For the most part, particularly for those that are vaccinated or have some prior immunity, the disease is not very severe.', 'The second part of it, which is as important, is do we mentally get to a place in endemic that we are comfortable getting on with life? We’re comfortable going to schools. We’re comfortable going to a mall. We’re comfortable going to restaurants. We’re comfortable getting together in our homes with our friends. That is a bit of a psychological point that people have to get to and say, “You know, this is something we’ll live with.”', 'As we write in our article that we published on pandemic to endemic, we all still get into a car, strap on our seatbelt, and drive. We still have a lot of deaths on the roads, even today. And another part we can explore has less to do with the disease itself but rather its impact on business and on the economy and our lives and livelihoods, and that is when we are just able to be in a sense of normal without quite the level of volatility that we have.', 'Lucia Rahilly: That’s really interesting. Let’s go a little deeper into a few of those examples.', 'Do you see movements toward endemic-style behavior in, for example, the US public-school systems where policy makers seem to be assessing the trade-offs differently than during earlier phases in the pandemic? And here I’ll say that were we recording this conversation last year at this time, I would have been bracing myself for the interruption of one of my school-age kids asking me for a cookie. Both of them are now fully back in the classroom. Is that an example of a shift toward more endemic-style decision making?', 'Shubham Singhal: It is. There are two things on this where consensus has to emerge. One is, what is the risk? So, again, essentially severe disease or death, what is the risk?', 'And for a lot of the population, as vaccinations have happened—including for children, although not all of them are eligible for a vaccine—there’s a greater degree of comfort that people have that at least the worst outcome is largely off the table: death.', 'The other side of it is, we learned through the lockdown, that the learning loss was quite meaningful and substantial. If you just look at math, the learning loss is quite a lot more substantial for younger students. First of all, this happened because the way that they learn is by being in person and interacting and not just sitting on a video call, if you will. The second part of it is that we saw a degree of inequality really emerge as well.', 'So it’s one thing for those who have the resources and have the space in their homes, and good Wi-Fi, and an extra computer, and so on, versus neighborhoods and populations where they don’t have access to that. So we now understood what the risk is on the other side, which is we will have a population fall behind and inequality increase. We then balance that against a reduced risk of severe disease or death, which, as vaccines came in, we looked at it and said, “We have to just have schools go on with [in-person learning], recognizing the risks, recognizing that we’ll need masks and other protocols. But we just have to keep moving forward because the cost is too high.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Media headlines now seem to be teeming with stories of hospitals under strain. We spoke recently on this podcast with Gretchen Berlin, one of your colleagues in the healthcare practice at McKinsey, about the protracted pressure that nurses are laboring under and what might be done to help. What are you hearing from  hospital employers about what they’re grappling with now?', 'Shubham Singhal: I was talking to the CEO of a pretty significant hospital system in the Midwest. This was at the beginning of January, and he said, “For the month of January, I’ve had to postpone all of the other care and elective surgeries because we are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.”', 'What is further interesting within that, in the ICU [intensive-care unit], beds are full, and for 93 percent of the admits, the patients were not vaccinated. Which is why Omicron, while it is less severe, for those that don’t have a vaccination or in some cases a prior immunity, they are ending up in the hospital, and so we have overwhelmed them. We have seen this in other geographies, where there’s higher vaccination rates. Some countries in Europe, you don’t see that same pattern of the system getting overwhelmed.', 'The other side of it is exactly as you said. As Omicron spread and particularly spread to those who are also vaccinated, not only is nursing staff stretched, a lot of the nurses then fall ill or get infected and are not able to work.', 'So the combination of the two is causing a fair amount of overwhelming of the system now. In a world where we are vaccinated, in a world where we have a degree of immunity where infection does not lead to hospitalization as much or as often, then our health system can handle it.', 'And that’s the definition of endemic. Because our health system is designed for and should be able to handle severe conditions. But it is not designed for these kinds of spikes that we’ve seen during COVID-19.', 'One other thing, Lucia, is that there is a real human cost to some of these overwhelming of the healthcare system. Elective surgeries have been postponed. These are not discretionary. This is not like, “Oh, it’ll be fine. A bypass is an elective surgery.” Bad things can happen with your cardiac condition, with a number of conditions that people have. So there’s also a very real cost that has emerged on people’s lives, of not getting their required care, because we’re so overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.', 'Lucia Rahilly: There’s the human cost of that, which is obviously enormous, and the priority. There’s also the way that the interruption to health and well-being contributes to loss of work, as you described with the nurses getting sick. Are we seeing talent shortages and the talent gap, which was looming as we went into this pandemic, getting worse during this Omicron surge, and how are leaders navigating that?', 'Shubham Singhal: It absolutely is. We’re still short by four or five million employees. Some amount of that is due to the accelerated retirement of those who were close to retirement. Are we going to get them back? I don’t know. Some of it is, for example, women with children who deal with the disruption with schools and the like. And, frankly, in many cases fear, where, if you have children under age five who don’t yet have a vaccine, how do you protect your family?', 'So that’s another issue that is kind of straining the system in terms of a talent shortage. On the other hand, when COVID-19 hit, we worried, “Wow, the economy will go into a deep recession.” It was deep, but it was very short-lived and bounced out.', 'We have eclipsed the size of the economy we had prepandemic with the growth that we’ve had. So now just imagine we’ve got the same size or bigger of an economy with five million fewer workers. That is a lot for us to be able to absorb. And that’s why, across the board, we have talent shortages that are playing out.', 'What Omicron did with the airlines, they have a protocol if employees get infected: they have to quarantine for an amount of time and not show up to work. You already have a worker shortage. You add to it when people have to be out of work.', 'Lucia Rahilly: That’s right. Shubham, you also mentioned supply chain and the supply chain issues that have resulted from the pandemic. How do we expect the current spike in COVID-19 infections to affect supply chain resilience?', 'Shubham Singhal: It’s a very good question, Lucia. First of all, over the years or decades, we built up a very efficient global supply chain for most things, which was built to be just in time and highly efficient. What we learned is that while it is designed to do those things, and it’s quite remarkable, it’s not necessarily as resilient as we would like it to be.', 'To be fair, there’s also a demand spike on goods that has happened during the pandemic. People can spend on services to go out and go to restaurants, et cetera. They spent a lot in goods: a 17 percent global increase in demand for goods is a lot to be able to fulfill. That is just on the demand side. On the supply side, you can have manufacturing shut down. You can have ports shut down due to not being able to operate at full strength when there aren’t enough people to come in because they’re infected.', 'The realignment of supply chains to incorporate resiliency takes time. But also, I would be hard pressed to imagine that we’ll continue to have many years where we would have close to 20 percent increase in goods demand that is straining it in either direction.', 'As we hopefully get beyond this, we’ll all stabilize our own purchasing patterns, spending more on services and experiences and a little less toward the goods that we’ve all been buying from our favorite online retail store while we’ve been sitting at home. So that will readjust too, and will help alleviate the pressure.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s turn to talk a little bit about what business leaders can do. When Omicron emerged, many companies were on the brink of implementing plans for at least a partial return to the office. How can business define its new normal? Does Omicron simply mean delaying that return? Or does it materially change the calculus for how returns should be managed?', 'One of the things that we said about the transition from pandemic to endemic is to ask what is it that we need to do as a society? Business is a major part of that, and business leaders have to lead within that.', 'Shubham Singhal: One of the things that we said about the transition from pandemic to endemic is to ask what is it that we need to do as a society? Business is a major part of that, and business leaders have to lead within that.', 'Rather than saying, “Oh, we’ll get beyond Omicron and all will be well,” to really get this comprehensive approach to management for an endemic COVID-19 in place, what is the first pillar of that? Define what the new normal is. And business leaders need to do this with their employee population.', 'So this is a difficult conversation but one that leaders need to build consensus around as to what will we accept if there’s one case in an office. Will we shut down for the next ten days? Or do we know how to kind of be able to deal with it, in an endemic world? They are going to have to do that, because that alignment and expectation setting with employees is very important. It can’t be, “Oh, come back now because cases are low,” and then, “Well, never mind. We’re not going to do it because the next variant showed up.”', 'The second part is, they have to be able to track and be transparent on where we are against those goals. So there will be times where the virus spread may be so wide that we have to resort to a bit of a retrenchment from being in person.', 'What are those thresholds? How do we know, in a way that we can trust, this is actually playing out? Also, there needs to be transparency on what you are going to do. Do you have a vaccine mandate or not? And if you have a vaccine mandate, how is your company stacking up against that mandate? Then we’ll know at this point, we’ll need boosters. Again, how is your company stacking up against booster adoption? Those are all points that will have to be tracked and communicated.', 'The other thing that workplaces will have to do is to answer, “Are we just going back to the workplace?” Many times we had stale air; we had open cubicles. Or have we learned from this and said, “We have installed and reconfigured our workspaces in a way that we limit some of the spread”?', 'Business leaders have done a great job through this time working with public-health authorities and others to make sure we have the right level of investment. You know, it is remarkable how quickly we develop the vaccines. It is great to see treatments coming out, but we’re going to have to make sure that we continue on with those, because for those people where bad outcomes happen, we’ll need to have the right treatments available.', 'Business has a very big stake as leaders to be engaged in making sure that the moment we have a couple of months of low virus spread, that we remember to make the investments needed to ensure that when and if a variant emerges, we’re able to have those protections in place and, frankly, more protections in place than we’ve had in the last year as well.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Are there any sort of specific examples of tools or approaches that you’ve seen leaders adopt successfully, especially those who have already navigated the transition back to in-person working? What’s the role of testing, for example, in return-to-office plans? And do we think testing, to your point about thinking beyond, will cause an immediate slow of the spread?', 'Shubham Singhal: On your first question, about what we have seen people do—there are many. For example, in manufacturing in the food industry, they went back to work early, well before the vaccines even came out, and they did learn a lot.', 'We saw one employer that has been able to achieve very high levels of vaccination, above 90 percent. And they are located in a geography that has been persistently low, in the 40-some percent rate of vaccination.', 'This employer had onsite testing and vaccinations easily available, so no one had to find it, go somewhere, schedule it, et cetera. So they caught infection as early as they could. So they could then kind of contain it from spreading very significantly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How did this employer change their office configuration for safety?', 'Shubham Singhal: They had to figure out and, for example, create pods of employees that came in at different times. They knew, the shift starts at eight, everyone shows up at eight, bunches up around the entrance and so on. We of course don’t want that to happen. So how do you sequence and create different times that different people will come in?', 'So they did that. They made changes in the factory workshop floor to make sure that only that part of the staff interact with each other. So we minimize the kind of not knowing. So if there is an infection, we can quarantine just that group versus having to shut down the whole site.', 'They literally mapped through and looked at how people walked through their facilities and reoriented how that happens so that no two people would cross each other as they walked around. You saw this when stores opened as well, pathways that marked where you stood. It was one-directional.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Do you think testing and masks are kind of durably in our future in the workplace?', 'Shubham Singhal: Many of the countries that dealt with the early-2000 SARS epidemic were actually quite a bit better prepared going into this pandemic—or the epidemic as it began—in parts of Asia, and they have adopted mask wearing. Particularly at different times of the year, you’ll see many people wear masks.', 'Now, whether every country will be willing to do that? That’s a societal choice over time. But we do know they are effective, particularly if the spread is high. I can imagine, even in geographies where people don’t want to adopt mask wearing into in their lives, or workplaces, or other places where people gather, you could see adoption emerging seasonally. For example, maybe the summer is OK to [wear a mask], but next fall or winter, we again have heightened risk and we see [the masks] come back. Testing for infection is an interesting one, because I think for a period we would see it used. The reality is it is also quite expensive today.', 'So how much testing is ubiquitous and not will depend a bit on the ability for us to get some of the cost of testing down. Now, even an antigen test today is somewhere between $15 to $25. If you’re doing that very regularly, that adds up quite quickly, and a PCR test is closer to $200. We are going to have to see if testing becomes and stays a big part of how we manage. We’re going to have to figure out how to innovate, to have the cost come down to about a dollar or $2 a test.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How might the timeline to endemicity play out differently across different geographies?', 'Shubham Singhal: I think the most important driver is, what is the level of immunity in the population? Even if it’s not immunity to infection, it’s immunity to a severe disease and death.', 'The most effective tool that we have for that today is vaccines. So what you will see is countries in which we have high penetration of vaccines and particularly high penetration of high-efficacy vaccines, and added to that are cases of prior infection which does also bring some degree of immunity. The combination of that will determine how quickly they move to endemic.', 'Countries have followed very different paths not only on vaccination rates but also on the level of spread that they have in their population. So we will continue to see a great degree of variability across countries in terms of when they approach endemicity.', 'Lucia Rahilly: You have been at the forefront of McKinsey’s COVID-19 response efforts since the outbreak of the pandemic almost two years ago. How optimistic are you that we have brighter days to come and on what time frame?', 'Shubham Singhal: I should say at the outset that the cost to human life in many ways has been very significant and continues to be. That is something that we all have to live with and it has affected us. But if you look ahead, you would say there are brighter days ahead because we have figured out how to do certain things in the space of less than two years. That to me is the part of optimism, that we have done so much and innovated so much because of necessity.', 'And as we harness that and continue to learn from it, I think it’ll be great. So while we feel great about vaccines and the mRNA platform, the mRNA platform was created to try to treat cancers. Maybe we could get excited about where it goes next with the kinds of treatments we might be able to develop because we have accelerated some of our understanding of how this might work out. I don’t know exactly all the ways in which we will see improvement to people’s lives and livelihoods. I’m certain we will see, and to your point on timing, I think we’ve already seen a lot of it improve. It will only accelerate from here is the way I kind of see it.', 'There’s a lot to be optimistic about. It just is sobered by the fact that we have had so much loss of life.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Shubham, thanks so much for joining us today.', 'Shubham Singhal: Thank you.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Shubham expressed some optimism about the future of mRNA technology. Katharine Hayhoe is optimistic as well, but her focus is on the environment. She’s the chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, and you’re about to hear a clip of her from our Author Talks series about the book she recently wrote: Saving Us: A Climate Scientist’s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World [Simon & Schuster, September 2021].', 'Katharine Hayhoe: As a climate scientist, I don’t find a lot of hope in the science itself, because often it seems like every new scientific study shows us that climate is changing faster or to a greater extent than we thought or affecting us in new ways.', 'The giant boulder of climate action is not sitting at the bottom of an impossibly steep cliff with only a few hands trying to push it up. That giant boulder is already at the top of the hill and itâ€™s already rolling down the hill in the right direction.', 'The giant boulder of climate action is not sitting at the bottom of an impossibly steep cliff with only a few hands trying to push it up. That giant boulder is already at the top of the hill and it’s already rolling down the hill in the right direction.', 'And it already has millions of hands on it. And if we add ours, it will go a tiny bit faster. And if we use our voice to encourage others, where we work, where we live, that all of the organizations we’re part of, our place of worship, our neighborhood, our children’s school, it will go even faster.', 'Climate change is the most politically polarized issue in the whole country. And it’s not just the United States. And part of this polarization is expressed through science-y sounding objections.', 'People say, “Oh, it’s not real. It’s not us. It’s the sun. It’s volcanoes. You climate scientists are just making this all up to line your pockets with government grants.” If we wanted to line our pockets, there are a lot easier ways to do it than inventing a global hoax and maintaining it for 200 years.', 'That’s how long we’ve known that digging up and burning coal and gas and oil produces heat-trapping gases that wrap an extra blanket around the planet, causing it to warm. But today, just 7 percent are dismissive. Seventy percent of us in the US are worried about climate change already. Every single one of us has a role to play in fixing this.', 'The time to act is now, but what’s holding people back are two things I talk about in the book, psychological distance and solution aversion. When you poll people across the United States, 70 percent of people are worried, and more than 70 percent agree that it’s real.', 'About the same numbers agree that climate change will affect future generations. Then you ask will climate change affect you personally, and the numbers plummet. Only about 40 percent of us agree that it will harm us personally. And even those of us who are concerned about it, we still think it’s an issue for the future, for people far away, or for people who care about other things than we do.', 'The two hardest chapters for me to write in the whole book were the chapters on fear and guilt. Fear serves a purpose. Fear wakes us up. Fear shows us that there’s a problem. And if we don’t fix it, it is the fate of civilization itself that hangs in the balance. It’s not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone. It is quite literally about saving us.', 'If we know what to do with the fear, if we know how to act, then that fear energizes us. It motivates us to act. Fifty percent of people in the US feel helpless. That idea that if I do something, can I even make a difference? If we don’t think that we can make a difference, if we have no sense of efficacy, fear paralyzes us.', 'And here’s the thing: if we don’t act, we are doomed.', 'We have something that is more powerful than our footprint, more powerful than our individual actions. And that is the shadow that we cast.', 'I started looking at history. I started looking at our modern industrialized society. I started looking at how things had changed radically and significantly. Civil rights, women getting the vote, the eradication of slavery: the world has changed in really massive ways along the same scale of the changes that we’re talking about that must happen today.', 'And how did it happen? It was because very ordinary people, people of no particular power or wealth or fame, people, many of whom we don’t even know their names today—they used their voices to call for that better world, to advocate for change, to say this is not the way things should be and there is something better.', 'And because of them, the world changed. That’s the way it’s changed before. And that is the way it can and must change again today.', 'We all have responsibility, a differentiated responsibility, but a responsibility, nonetheless. So that’s what the big climate meetings are about.', 'These climate meetings are a chance for all of the countries to show up to the global potluck dinner, so to speak, and to bring their contributions. It becomes painfully obvious who is and who isn’t contributing their fair share to the Paris Agreement.', 'It encourages us to up our ambition together. So if I were prime minister of another country or the president of another country, I would be looking very carefully at all the dishes that people brought to the global potluck. It begins with them, our leaders using their voices too.', 'Here’s the thing: if we give up, if we decide that we’re doomed, we are. But what does make a difference is action.', 'Katharine Hayhoe is a climate scientist and chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy. Shubham Singhal is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Detroit office.

What can be done to inspire them to stay?', 'Many nurses are reevaluating their commitment to direct patient care given the demands of the coronavirus. Now, during a time of unprecedented need, what can health systems and other employers of nurses do to prevent losing this backbone of the healthcare workforce to the Great Attrition? Hear from Gretchen Berlin, a registered nurse (RN) and McKinsey senior partner, on the state of nurses and on specific suggestions to improve their work experience, practically and emotionally. After, McKinsey associate partner David Baboolall joins us to discuss the recent findings of the McKinsey Quarterly article “Being transgender at work.” An edited version of the conversations follow.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is hosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Today, we have Gretchen Berlin on the show, a registered nurse and senior partner in our healthcare practice. Gretchen, welcome to the podcast.', 'Gretchen Berlin: Thank you.', 'Lucia Rahilly: It’s great to have you here. Nurses have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis for nearly two years now. Infection rates are surging. What are you hearing on the ground about how nurses are feeling now?', 'Gretchen Berlin: Nurses are not a monolithic group, and it varies quite significantly across the country. In general, demands on nurses were high even before COVID-19. Across the country and across the world, we have an aging population. We have a population that’s getting sicker and needs more care.', 'Now, fast-forward to today: a lot of those nurses are tired. In any crisis situation, you’re running on adrenaline and trying to get through to the other side. What has become clearer as the months have gone by—with Delta and now Omicron—is that there may not be a magical end of the tunnel, and that is a very different world to be facing.', 'It’s a lot of pressure, a lot of day-to-day, and then month-to-month, demands and potentially not a lot of relief in the near-term future.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And we see resignation generally in the zeitgeist in the wake of the pandemic. Quitting is up across the board in different industries, and McKinsey’s own “Great Attrition” research shows that the intent to quit continues to be heightened. How do nurses stand in that area? Are there factors that are specifically driving nurses out the door?', 'Gretchen Berlin: Nurses are no exception to our research on the likelihood of people leaving their professions. We ran a survey in early 2021 that showed about 20 percent of folks were looking to leave. [Editor’s note: This figure rose to 32 percent in a McKinsey survey conducted in November and December of 2021.]', 'What we’ve seen in the healthcare market in recent months is massive competition through things such as retention bonuses, attraction bonuses for new hires; frankly, in a way, that is largely unsustainable.', 'I think the more troubling piece is that nurses are exiting the profession altogether. It’s not just a challenge that the US is facing; we hear it from health systems around the world.', 'To answer your question as to what drives them to leave: we see a lot around compensation, and, yes, we need to pay nurses adequately for the services and value that they’re delivering. But at the end of the day, a lot of it comes down to the support and recognition that they feel in their workplace, from their leaders, their managers, their team, and through ensuring there’s sufficient staffing, sufficient respite, and gratitude.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Presumably, there’s variability in care settings, but are you seeing extremities of workload, insufficient staffing, or an emotional toll on nurses right now as the pandemic drags on?', 'Gretchen Berlin: Yes, you can almost draw a timeline of the pandemic. It started at this crisis moment where many health systems were flexing staff in a variety of ways. You had nurses who were historically nurses in the OR [operating room] becoming ICU [intensive-care unit] nurses or nurses who were accustomed to running ventilators moving over onto COVID-19 units.', 'You had nurses in the outpatient settings moving into inpatient. We had nurses crossing state lines and operating in health systems they had never operated in before. All of that was happening, with most non-COVID-19 care being delayed.', 'Health systems have been doing everything they can to ensure sufficient staffing, but it has been a challenge to meet the need, to say the least. It’s had to be met by contract labor and additional support, which is extremely expensive and can often be challenging to integrate into the regular care team.', 'Because of those staffing challenges or the variability in the workload, we haven’t yet hit a new normal in the health system. We continue to see reports coming out about the impact of delayed care, and that still hasn’t fully run its course through the system.', 'We have done surveys of health systems every quarter, and they’re still projecting that surgical backlogs and preventative backlogs are not yet through the system.', 'Lucia Rahilly: It feels like nurses have always been required to be incredibly resilient. They are expected to behave heroically, but nurses are also human beings, and we’re seeing a rise in clinician burnout across the board.', 'Is mental health a new issue for nurses, or have they been suffering under the radar for longer than many of us might have suspected?', 'Gretchen Berlin: I don’t think mental health is a new issue in nursing at all. In general, mental health is an underappreciated, underdiscussed issue in the entire population, and nurses are no exception to that.', 'Many parts of care have provided support and respite for clinical teams. For example, pediatric hospitals will allow rotations between cardiac ICU step-down units and outpatient settings, allowing nurses to avoid being in the most critical, upsetting care settings day in, day out, in perpetuity.', 'We haven’t really built in that decompression space for a lot of healthcare. And it’s interesting that you use the word “burnout”—there are a lot of sensitivities around that word in healthcare. And rightly so, as some believe that it implies that the clinicians themselves aren’t resilient enough to deal with what is happening. When, in reality, what is happening is an untenable situation for anyone to individually survive in, let alone thrive in.', 'We, as a society, need to lift up these professions. In the last two years, we’ve had probably ten different parades for different professional sports teams who have won championships. And, yes, these events bring great joy to society. But where is that kind of support and recognition at the community level for what our frontline heroes are doing day in and day out?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Right, it’s a really good point. I live in New York City, and at the beginning of the pandemic, we used to stop what we were doing and clap at seven in the evening for the essential workers. And it was such an amazing outpouring of gratitude.', 'But now, lo these many months later, that appreciation may reside in all of us, but it’s much less visible.', 'Gretchen Berlin: Exactly. The nurses and clinicians have not stopped seeing the patients, the firefighters and police have not stopped answering the calls for patients in respiratory distress that may or may not have COVID-19. The level of stress that individuals are dealing with is going to have massive implications on everyone’s well-being, which then will put more strain back on the healthcare system through mental-health needs, cardiac needs, et cetera.', 'The level of stress that individuals are dealing with is going to have massive implications on everyone’s well-being, which then will put more strain back on the healthcare system.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Seems also that since family members are not allowed to visit bedside in many healthcare settings, this could add to the emotional work of nurses?', 'Gretchen Berlin: I think that’s absolutely right. Nurses are dealing with a lot at the bedside, in terms of helping patients die and helping families. To your point, many patients, especially at the start of this, had only the nurses with them for those final moments, and I’m not sure that we’ve provided the decompression space for what that does to an individual who has to see that and support people through that over and over again.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s talk about what we should be doing to make this better. You’ve written that we should move away from thinking about a rebuild and shift instead toward an entirely new build of our nursing workforce. And specifically, Gretchen, you mentioned several areas: workforce health, workforce flexibility, reimagining care-delivery models, and strengthening talent pipelines.', 'Let’s start with workforce health and well-being, both of which feel exigent right now. How can those areas be improved?', 'Gretchen Berlin: I think the areas of workforce health and well-being can be improved in a couple of ways. Some of it is societal recognition and celebration. When you hear that someone is an astronaut, the reaction often is, “That is so cool; tell me about that.” How do we make that be the narrative for our frontline caregivers?', 'The second form of recognition in our society often comes financially through compensation for the role that nursing plays.', 'There’s other financial recognition that can be provided, too, and has happened over time in terms of loan forgiveness from states, from the federal government, from various nonprofits in support of these roles, which different parts of the community can get involved in.', 'And then I think there’s recognition in the workplace. A lot of health systems do it in spades, but genuinely doing it means doubling down on the basics of leadership recognition, being on the floor with nurses to understand the simple and the complicated fixes to make their lives easier—things such as making sure supplies are there on time, and eliminating unnecessary documentation so that they can spend more time at the bedside.', 'Lucia Rahilly: What about workforce flexibility? Many nurses must already work shifts. What does workforce flexibility look like in the nursing context?', 'Gretchen Berlin: Workforce flexibility takes a few flavors. Some of it is flexibility in the care setting. So, a bit of what we discussed earlier: allowing folks the ability to have the intense experience in the ICU when they want it, but also to have the ability to go elsewhere to get different experiences—obviously all within appropriate licensure and clinical standards—depending on what’s going on with them individually or with the rest of their lives.', 'Health systems are often doing this through regional float pools or other team-based models, but more and more of this can and should happen.', 'Lucia Rahilly: The pandemic obviously accelerated digital adoption in all kinds of areas, including telehealth. How might telehealth affect future care delivery and nurses’ roles in it?', 'Gretchen Berlin: Well, I think telehealth is an example of flexibility, and more nurses now say that they would like to continue to participate in telehealth.', 'The other thing that happened during the pandemic that was interesting was the more digital ways of providing patient monitoring and care. Many facilities moved a lot of the patient monitors out into the hallway to avoid unnecessary donning of PPE [personal protective equipment] and going into the room. And that actually allows for more patient monitoring at any one time.', 'So how do you translate that into a new model? Some parts of patient care you’re never going to get rid of—for example, the human interaction. You need to do physical assessments. You need to administer medications. But how do we take what worked in a moment of crisis and institutionalize it further in our systems and in our technology?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Is there a possibility of hybrid work for nurses? And if so, what would that look like?', 'Gretchen Berlin: I think there is the option of hybrid working for nurses in the future.', 'Often when we think of telemedicine, we think of a parent at home worried about their kid’s fever, and if they should bring them in or not, and getting a telemedicine visit. But telemedicine and teleconsultations are used for a lot more complex things. Especially in rural hospitals—for example, if you have a patient coming in with a stroke, they’ll have more of a virtual consultation, with higher specialty service elsewhere.', 'We’re doing that for tele-ICU, et cetera. And individuals could operate across these care settings. Again, of course, all within license requirements, to provide flexibility. And we are seeing that nurses are more interested in doing telemedicine going forward.', 'Lucia Rahilly: It’s interesting to think of telehealth not just as a convenience but also as potentially a model that improves the cadence and the quality of care through more frequent monitoring or monitoring for folks in rural settings who might not otherwise make it all the way into the doctor on a more routine basis.', 'Gretchen Berlin: I think it can be very effective, especially for more rural settings.', 'Lucia Rahilly: You talked about fungibility in care settings and regional float pools and so forth. Gretchen, you yourself went to nursing school. Are the skills that nurses need to do their jobs successfully changing?', 'Gretchen Berlin: We continue to ride the curve of technology.', 'In the past 20–25 years, there has been a lot of technology adoption in care delivery. A lot of these technologies often don’t fully replace how something is done, which adds to nurses’ workloads. How do you then use technology to declutter what a nurse does and help get the signal through the noise of all of the alarms and all of the vitals and all of the documentation to actually help clinicians practice at the top of their license and focus on what truly matters?', 'I think that is very exciting, and that is the promise of redefining how the clinical workforce can go into the future. There are longer-term systemic things we can and should do in terms of strengthening the talent pipeline: encouraging students to engage in science, engage in medicine.', 'It will also require expanding schools and clinical-training spots. And we see health systems doing that directly because they recognize the need and aren’t willing to wait for others in the ecosystem to do it. And these things are all needed to rebuild our talent pipelines and skills for the workforce of the future.', 'But in the meantime, we need to flip the operating models that we have for our workforce now, so that we’re able to bridge the gap. Otherwise, I worry, we’re going to have more than a decade of pretty turbulent times, where we have a lot of clinical demand and a very turbulent workforce.', 'Lucia Rahilly: My niece is in high school, and she recently surprised me by raising the possibility of getting an RN degree.', 'It occurred to me when she was talking about this that we hear so much now about the importance of purpose, particularly vis-à-vis Gen Z. Do you think the pandemic has in any way created pull into the nursing field because it has surfaced as so vital and so high stakes?', 'Gretchen Berlin: Yeah. It’s a really interesting point.', 'In some ways, I think the pandemic has shone a light on the purpose, as you said. But also, we have seen in our own research that some nurses are more likely to stay in the profession now than they were before.', 'We haven’t surveyed to see if that translates into more folks interested, but we do see an increase in applications to schools going up. And I think some of that is because of the importance of purpose, and some of it is because the profession is changing, and nursing can be much more flexible than your traditional office job.', 'In a lot of ways, the criticality of the role has been elevated for people. A lot of people want nothing more than to support society and individuals on the biggest challenge of the day, which right now is COVID-19 and meeting the pent-up demand that it has caused.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Acknowledging that access to quality nursing care is, in part because of COVID-19, such a high-stakes and collectively vital issue, are you optimistic about the potential for positive change, both for the sake of nurses and for all of us?', 'Gretchen Berlin: I am quite optimistic. I think there are a lot of really bright minds trying to solve this. There are a lot of committed health systems, employers, and societies trying to invest and fix it. I think more than anything, there’s a really committed workforce who’s excited to innovate, who has shown tremendous flexibility and resilience already and will continue to do that going forward.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Any suggestions for keeping this issue on the front burner, assuming COVID-19 starts to recede?', 'Gretchen Berlin: I think that there are ways we can continue to recognize as a society. I think that’s part of the power of conversations like these. We have National Nurses Week in May. There are obviously national companies that run nurses campaigns. There are ways that each of us as individuals, or our small businesses, or our large businesses, can draw attention to our first responders and our clinicians in general but our nurses especially through celebrations, promotions, and accolades.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s close there. Gretchen, that was a fascinating discussion. Thanks so much.', 'Gretchen Berlin: Thank you. I hope we all have a better 2022.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Roberta, so many of us have had the experience of relying elementally on nursing care. My daughter, who is now a happy, coltish, and—knock on wood—healthy six-and-a-half-year-old girl, had respiratory surgery at birth and spent almost two weeks in the surgical NICU [neonatal intensive-care unit]. And those NICU nurses were just invaluable.', 'During that experience, our family will never, never forget them. They were vital not just to her survival but also to our own emotional stability and well-being. At that time, it was incredible.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I feel the same way, Lucia, and I’ve had the complete opposite life cycle experience of dealing with in-home nurses for my mother when she refused to move out of the house that she had been in for, you know, some 70 years.', 'The fact that we felt comfortable enough to have people come into our house to take care of my mother made the final months of her life that much more comfortable, which gave us a lot of comfort too.', 'It’s horrible to see such flux within the nursing workforce. And there’s another cohort of people that are at risk of quitting, in part because they don’t feel valued at work. It’s our transgender colleagues. We’re about to hear from David Baboolall about our recent article: “Being transgender at work.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: David, thanks for joining us today.', 'David Baboolall: Lucia, thank you so much for having me. I’m very excited that we’re having this conversation.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Acknowledging the range and the variety of experience within the trans demographic, what has our research taught us about what it’s like to be trans in today’s workplace?', 'David Baboolall: I’d like to start off with just a few facts around unemployment, if that works with you. Unfortunately, I’ll start quite stark.', 'Only 73 percent of transgender adults are actually in the workforce compared with 82 percent of cisgender adults. Our survey, which we ran across a number of trends over this past year, shows that trans individuals are two times more likely to be unemployed than cisgender people, which is kind of crazy.', 'And in the US alone, almost two times as many trans people report being recently out of work. The scarcity and precarity of transgender employment can lead to loneliness, instability, and alienation from the rest of the workplace. When we look at wages, candidly, the situation is equally as stark. Transgender people make far less money than cisgender people do.', 'The average household income of a transgender adult is about $17,000 less than that of a cisgender one. And our survey showed that transgender individuals are almost 2.5 times more likely to work in places such as retail or food, which, as we know, in large proportion are entry-level-paying jobs, paying the minimum wage in the US.', 'Then, when we take it one step further to intersectionality, when we look at folks who are marginalized in addition to being trans—for example, people of color—the figures are worse. Seventy-five percent of Native American trans people and 43 percent of Hispanic trans people make less than $25,000, with that figure only equating to 17 percent for White cisgender people.', 'Lucia Rahilly: That’s a dire picture, and it sounds like an urgent need to take action. The stakes are high. What are some examples of the specific challenges—the trends employees confront daily in the workplace?', 'David Baboolall: In the corporate push for more diverse workplaces, especially since the racial reckoning last year, the transgender population candidacy is unsupported. And this is more than just a matter of career progression, promotion, or climbing to the top of the ladder.', 'Whereas other populations strive to feel included in the workplace, transgender workers want to feel safe. For members of the trans and gender-nonconforming community, safety is top of mind—safety from physical harm, mental harm, or emotional harm. And what we’re seeing in our data is that less than half of transgender adults are comfortable being fully open about their gender identity at work.', 'For members of the trans and gender-nonconforming community, safety is top of mind—safety from physical harm, mental harm, or emotional harm.', 'And when we take that a step further, two-thirds are uncomfortable being out with their customers and their clients. And being in a client-facing role myself, Lucia, the inability to be out with folks that I’m talking to not only on a monthly but also a weekly—if not hourly—basis is a lot to grapple with, especially if you’re in client service.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Safety is obviously fundamental. I mean, that’s Maslov’s hierarchy of needs, right? That’s basic. Besides ensuring that employees feel safe and are able to bring their full selves to work, what can leaders do to help at the enterprise level?', 'David Baboolall: I think step one is education and awareness. That’s my biggest goal with this report and this research. I’m hoping corporate leaders and leaders of different sectors will take this report and say, “I have a reference to learn.”', 'I have a glossary that we put together to discern different words that are used in the trans community. And then I think you can go across the employee life cycle and be intentional in recruiting. How can you connect with potential trans new hires or participate in specific recruiting events? Signal to those that are coming to your firm that you are excited to be a workplace where trans individuals thrive.', 'I think the second step is to think about offering trans-affirming benefits. And this doesn’t just mean medical benefits, gender-affirming surgery or hormone therapy. It also involves thinking about whether you have mental-healthcare support for a community that is disproportionately affected by mental-health issues.', 'The third step is about other policies and programs, such as reviewing company dress codes, eliminating gender-specific language, offering diversity trainings that are nuanced to gender identity. And I think the last step is adopting an overall inclusive culture—are the forms and documents that you ask your employees to fill out on a weekly, annual, or half-annual basis asking for personal pronouns? Are they asking for preferred names? Does your office have gender-neutral bathrooms?', 'Lucia Rahilly: You mentioned language and a glossary in the report, which seems vital, particularly because fear and confusion over language can hold colleagues back from talking about some of these issues. What are some small steps that all of us in the workforce might take to signal support for our transgender colleagues and potentially improve their daily experience directly?', 'David Baboolall: My teams actually practice it at McKinsey. When we kick off a new project at McKinsey, we do team introductions. And within those sort of simple five to ten introductory questions—What’s your name? Where are you from? Where did you grow up? How did you join McKinsey?—there’s the question of what are your personal pronouns? What is your preferred name? Those two simple questions signal to any person in the trans community, “Hey, this person seems like an ally.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Are there any examples from your own career of allyship?', 'David Baboolall: I think personally there have been a number of instances over the last year where folks have noticed my pronoun change—clients have come to me, I’ve had senior individuals at McKinsey come to me, I’ve had people in my building when I would wear work name tags back home. They see my pronouns, and they’re inquisitive, asking, “Hey, is everything OK? How can I be supportive? Is there anything that you’d like to talk through? How can I become educated?” And that’s been great. I think that that has been an opportunity for folks to engage because I’m very open about my personal pronouns, and I use those for every introduction that I actually have.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Any thoughts for leaders on the best way to know that they’re making progress?', 'David Baboolall: I think the more it comes up in conversation, the more you’re likely doing things right. We tend to avoid conversations when it comes to topics of diversity that we’re not used to, that make us uncomfortable, that we’re nervous about getting wrong.', 'So the more that these topics are being brought up, the more ideas that are being brought to senior leaders—such as “Hey, maybe we should do this for our trans colleagues? Maybe we should do this in terms of gender identity? Have we thought about offering this healthcare benefit? Have we thought about changing this policy? Have we really thought through placing a gender-neutral bathroom at our factory site?”—the better it is. As those ideas are flourishing, as folks are being more vocal about it, you’re doing something right. And they’re open to having the conversation to advance change.', 'Lucia Rahilly: David, fascinating.

Here’s how leaders can help.,"['Women are doing more to support employee well-being but face higher stress levels as a result. Here’s how leaders can help.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, senior partners and leaders Alexis Krivkovich and Lareina Yee join Lucia Rahilly, global editorial director, to discuss some of the startling and hopeful results recently released in the Women in the Workplace 2021 report. An edited version of their conversation follows. After, we hear from senior partner Sven Smit and what happened when, about 20 years ago, while at McKinsey, he asked for time off to spend with his young daughter. The McKinsey Podcast is hosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Today, we welcome back to the podcast Alexis Krivkovich and Lareina Yee, both senior partners and leaders here at McKinsey. Alexis and Lareina, thanks so much for speaking with us today.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: It’s great to be here.', 'Lareina Yee: Thank you for having us.', 'Lucia Rahilly: As always, this year’s Women in the Workplace research covers wide-ranging ground, but today we’ll home in on three areas, and I’d like to start with a topic that many of us have felt personally and painfully during this pandemic. And that topic is burnout.', 'Alexis and Lareina, as part of your research, you and the team interviewed a variety of women across corporate America. I’d like to read a redacted version of one of their stories on the topic of burnout. And then I’ll ask you to react. And, for context, the woman sharing this particular story self-identified as being at the director level in her organization, a Latina immigrant to the US, and a mother of kids under four. Here’s what she told us:', '“I’m feeling long-term burnout. I’m someone who always prided myself on being in control and having strong, emotional resiliency. And I am not doing great. My manager checked in on me, and I know he’s trying to empathize, but he said something like, ‘Oh, so-and-so keeps calling me to make sure you’re OK. We know you’re a flight risk.’', '“We’re all aware of the social context we’re operating in, especially women working in corporate America. For me, I think, am I going to be another one that falls from all this? I’m fighting so hard, but it feels like the odds are against me, and it hurts.”', 'I find that incredibly powerful as an encapsulation of the battle that many women have waged internally over the course of the pandemic. And the numbers seem to bear that out.', 'The research shows that the burnout gap between women and men has almost doubled since last year’s report. Lareina, help us understand the dynamics here. Why are so many women so tired?', 'Lareina Yee: Well, frankly, women are hanging on. And that is probably the most blunt and simple way to put it. Forty-two percent of women report being burned out.', 'And, Lucia, as you mentioned, that is higher than last year and higher than men. So a little under half of your population of women are burned out. And that’s where we stand today. What’s fascinating about your story, the vignette, is the raw honesty with which that woman is sharing her experience from many different perspectives.', 'Also, a frankly cold response from her manager—in this case a man, but it could be a woman—of, I know you are someone we’re trying to retain. I mean, that makes you feel like a number, not a human who’s going through an incredibly tough time.', 'And, by the way, I don’t know how this woman’s performance is, but what we see across corporate America is that productivity is at an all-time high. And so what we often see is that women are delivering the performance and business results but at a great personal toll.', 'Lucia Rahilly: The report also says that despite their own increasing burnout, women take action more consistently to fight burnout—and generally to extend their support to colleagues and reports—than men in similar positions do.', 'I will confess that I love and simultaneously loath the phrase “office housekeeping” that is used in the report. Alexis, what exactly is this extra work that women are doing?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: One of the most fascinating findings this year was how women leaders are really stepping in, in this moment, to be the type of leaders that companies say they most need and most value.', 'That role that they’re playing is really instrumental, frankly, to keeping a lot of companies going. Women senior leaders do more to help their employees navigate work–life challenges, relative to their male peers. Similarly, they spend that additional time helping manage workloads, and they’re 60 percent more likely to be focusing on emotional support.', 'To employees, these things matter not only because they feel good, but employees say when they’re receiving that type of additional support, they’re happier in their job. And they’re less likely to be thinking about a move.', 'In a moment where we’re facing the great reflection, where so many employees are thinking about making a big move, having women leaders stepping in—this is really critical. But it explains a lot of this sensation that we hear regarding burnout and fatigue because they’re disproportionately doing this additional work in the office context, and we already know, because we’ve measured it in the past, that they’re disproportionately doing it at home too.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Alexis, I love that you mentioned the great reflection, or some are calling it the Great Resignation.', 'Lareina, you recently wrote a piece on the “third shift” for Fast Company, and there’s a great line in that piece toward the end: “Leaders can lurch from a health crisis to a talent crisis. Or they can take preventive measures that show they value their people.”', 'What are these preventive measures that leaders can take? What should leaders be doing differently at this time?', 'Lareina Yee: First? Let’s not just wait for this to play out. And, quite frankly, I think a lot of companies, unconsciously or consciously, are just letting it wait out: “Let’s just see what it’s like when we return to office. Let’s see what it’s like in a couple of months.” You know, “Let’s see what it’s like when we have another vaccine rollout.”', 'That’s not the right mindset here. As you said, you face a potential talent crisis, because as women—and as your workforce overall—have been reflecting, you don’t know if they’re going to make a move, and if they were to make a move and you were to lose half of your women senior leaders, that would take you back decades.', 'So, Lucia, to your point, what can leaders do first? They can acknowledge where we are. Second, they can think about what is the professional progression for these talented women. Third, they can start actually forming the work routines for a return to office, not waiting for the physical workspace but actually starting to live into it today.', 'Instead of having completely unchecked boundaries, start to put those in, start to put in the talent-management processes, the manager support, and the actual individual experience. And if you need to start asking different questions of your workforce in your pulse, do so.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Alexis, is there anything that leaders can do to rebalance the workload that women are disproportionately shouldering in this “emotional housekeeping” area?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Well, let’s start with the facts because it’s so astounding to me that, in this day and age, they still hold true. One in three women, and 60 percent of mothers with young children, just like the example you shared at the beginning, spend five or more hours a day on housework and caregiving. Five hours a day is at least another half-time job. And COVID-19 sort of stripped bare for us what was already under the surface and well understood by every working woman I know, which is how imbalanced those responsibilities outside the workplace are. Because these imbalances are not well recognized, and historically companies have not played a role in feeling a responsibility for that.', 'One in three women, and 60 percent of mothers with young children,...spend five or more hours a day on housework and caregiving.', 'So one role for companies is to be thinking about how do we reflect performance reviews and expectations. For the majority of women, the thing they most worry about is how they’re going to be evaluated in their performance. It’s not “how much extra work I’m doing at home.” It’s, “Am I going to be penalized because this will have a hangover effect?”', 'We see the companies that are out in front of this right now. And what I mean by “out in front” is outperforming year over year on diversity goals. The companies that are outpacing their peers are leaning forward on things like childcare, elder-care supplements, thinking about flexibility, reimagining the roles. And, in particular, focusing more on the outputs and less on the inputs. “I don’t need FaceTime with you 24/7 if you get a great job done.”', 'The second thing they’re doing is they’re actually rewarding that extra work that women are doing in the workplace. When [women] show up as leaders who care for employees and their well-being—in the ways they disproportionately are holding the responsibility for DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion]—only 25 percent of companies reward that in their performance reviews. But that 25 percent of companies is disproportionately those companies that are out in front on DEI overall.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Speaking of DEI, the story we heard was shared by a working mom who is also Latina. Lareina, can you speak to burnout for women at the intersection—women of color, for example, or LGBTQ+ women?', 'Lareina Yee: Let’s start with something that Alexis just said, which is that, in this period of time, women have stepped up. Only a quarter of them say that that extra work was reflected in their performance review, a promotion, or a raise. So you’re doing extra and being largely unrewarded for it. That’s the starting point for all women.', 'To your point, as we look at intersectionality, the challenge is that the barriers all around you, from the very moment you start, are so much steeper. You have that extra context as well.', 'So let’s make that specific. Let’s say you are an Asian woman starting out. Perhaps you are someone like me. I am Asian American. You go through the corporate world, doing the extra work, less recognized even before. And still now you are much less likely to be promoted.', 'We see that Asian women account for one in 15 roles in the entry level among women, but they’re only one in 50 in the C-suite. We see that if you’re a Latinx woman, if you’re a Black woman, if you’re a woman with a disability, that at each of those intersections, the likelihood of being promoted, the gaps in terms of getting to the next level, the broken rung, they’re not just at the entry level. They’re there every step of the way.', 'We also know that things like microaggressions or the experience of being an “only” are so much more acute. If you put yourself in her shoes for a moment, you have to say, my goodness, she must really be committed to this organization, with all of those headwinds, with all of those barriers, to still be delivering results and putting in extra.', 'At some point, are we going to have the ability to recognize that informal performance in feedback and in actually thinking about the way in which we support talented people in our organization?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s turn to this question of advancement and mobility for women—specifically, to the phenomenon you just referred to that we call the broken rung.', 'And here, I’ll share a story that was, again, part of your qualitative research. This was shared by a Black woman who is a senior manager in her organization. Here is what she said:', '“At my company, we have these different leadership programs, which no one really knows about nor has the qualifications to get into. It tends to be people who are friendly with each other. And people tend to gravitate toward people who are like them and who look like them.', '“I’ve talked to folks that have been here their entire career, White males, and they started off perhaps in the warehouse. Now, they’re at the VP [vice-president] level. I’ve also talked to a lot of Black and Brown associates that have been here for 18 years and are barely above the level they were initially at, or they were a little bit higher, but nowhere near their White peers, and no one really to talk to them and say, ‘Hey, let me fight for you.’”', 'Alexis, Lareina just mentioned the broken rung. And we’ve talked about that in our publishing before, but, for context, for new listeners, what does the phrase “the broken rung” really mean?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: The broken rung is the phenomenon that, for many people, feels really counterintuitive. The most inequitable, the most uneven, promotion between men and women is not actually at the very top, in those coveted C-suite and highly visible leadership roles. It’s, in fact, at the very first step up to manager. It’s that very first leap into management and early management that unlocks that entire pathway that that woman was describing—a future opportunity. Where men disproportionately, relative to women, get access again and again, year over year.', 'For every 100 men who leap forward, only 86 women do. And while that difference might feel small because it’s happening at the very start of careers, it’s amplified across huge numbers. And what it means is that women’s career progression is slowed down right out of the gate, and they never have that opportunity to catch up.', 'It also means that the future pipeline of diverse leaders we would want to see for those later opportunities never appears in equal numbers. And that’s why so many companies look at their leadership ranks and say, “Even if I now want to accelerate diversity and representation, I haven’t built and cultivated the generation of leaders that I need.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: So you’re speaking to progress over time. What progress have you seen so far? Have we seen improvements in the ways that women are faring relative to men vis-à-vis being promoted over the years that we’ve been doing this research?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Interestingly, the most progress has happened at the very top. In fact, the biggest gain in the past seven years has been in the C-suite, the roles right at the table with the CEO.', 'That’s really encouraging because these are highly visible and high-power positions, but it’s also where we started furthest from equity to begin with. So we have gained ground, yes. But we’re now at one in four, when we start out with men and women at nearly 50/50 at the beginning of the pipeline.', 'So while we’ve seen incremental gains, what we haven’t seen is this tidal wave that I think, frankly, by 2021, so many of us expected, recognizing how much diversity exists at the beginning [of the pipeline]. Some of the bright spots that are out there have been in the past year. Even that increased focus that’s been placed on race and intersectionality in particular has meant that the gap between women of color and White women has closed some.', 'And that’s a really good thing. But overall, we’re still so far from where we need to be to get to equity. To your point, this is a long game, right? It takes a long time to build a next generation.', 'So there’s the thought that companies could be in this perilous moment, where if we double down, we have a real opportunity to win this moment of reflection. But if we don’t, there are so many talented, diverse colleagues in companies that will be thinking about, “Am I getting the return on the investment I’m putting in when I know I’m giving extra, and I know that my company self-describes they don’t reward it, formally.” That’s the perilous moment we face.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s take that point and segue to our last segment, turning specifically to the experience of women of color in the workplace. And here, we’ll hear a bit of a story from an East Asian woman working in an entry-level job. Here is what she said:', '“Because I’m the only woman of color on my team, there’s a visible difference between me and the other people on the screen. That can be intimidating. It makes me cautious and more reserved about what I say or do. I feel, in those spaces, like I’m representing either women or my race or ethnicity. So I don’t want to say or do something that could contribute to a stereotype about women or people of color.”', 'Lareina, you’ve written much about the phenomenon of “onliness.” Anything to say in response to that story?', 'Lareina Yee: That story captures being an only so well. It is the simultaneous experience of feeling isolated and also worried and pressured to represent the most positive stereotypes. You think about that surge of, frankly, negative energy, fear, self-consciousness. And, by the way, all of that is distracting you from the purpose for why you are in that room, which is about the work itself. And that happens to you at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 1:30 p.m., five o’clock—and that’s Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and probably a little bit on Sunday, just for kicks.', 'And you wonder why, over the course of five years, ten years in the workplace, that doesn’t have an impact on you. So on the one hand, you can say, “Sell, I guess, the upside,” she says a bit sarcastically. “You’re driving an enormous amount of resilience and training.” But I think we would all say that that’s not the way to bring out the best in people. Particularly, your quote, your story, was of an Asian woman. What’s really interesting about Asian intersectionality is it’s often less spoken about. That story isn’t one that a lot of people understand.', 'And saying, oh, your experience is the same as a White woman’s experience or the same as a Black woman’s experience is incredibly wrong. Each of these experiences has unique dynamics to it. So then it goes back on you to explain that to somebody.', 'I think after all of that you’re just exhausted, and I go back to 42 percent of women are burned out [and probably thinking] “Well, you know, I’m exhausted just even thinking about that, never mind delivering on my job, delivering on the targets and expectations, going home, and if I have children, in the evening, doing my second shift.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: We talked earlier about new commitments to DEI initiatives, which would presumably help or mitigate some of this exhaustion of having to explain to and educate colleagues and so forth over the past couple of years. Certainly, and particularly since the killing of George Floyd, many leaders have become galvanized and spoken publicly about taking action on racial equity. What did the Women in the Workplace research tell us about how that revitalized focus has played out so far in the workplace?', 'Lareina Yee: The corporate commitment is at an all-time high toward improving racial equality in local communities across all of the states, across all our urban centers, across rural places. I mean, that’s extraordinary.', 'The challenge is that commitment isn’t backed up by the experiences we’ve seen this year. And I’m sad to say that, but the facts tell the story.', 'Let’s just take the very simple concept of allyship. What we see this year is that the number of leaders, both men and women, of any race, of any intersection, are raising their hand. And they’re saying, I absolutely want and believe it’s important to be an ally. But the very same phenomenon we saw last year, we continue to see, which is, when we start to ask questions about the day-to-day actions of an ally, we see a huge drop-off.', 'So while close to 80 percent of managers in the United States will say, “I am an ally,” when we actually look at brass tacks—practical actions of offering an opportunity for a woman of color, bringing someone into a circle they weren’t in before, actually asking them how they’re doing, supporting them—that drops off to the low teens. That disconnect between recognition and action? That still holds us back in the day-to-day workplace.', 'While close to 80 percent of managers in the United States will say, ‘I am an ally,’ when we actually look at brass tacks...that drops off to the low teens.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Lareina, any specific ways you’ve seen leaders support women of color successfully?', 'Lareina Yee: It absolutely starts with advocating for new opportunities for women of color.', 'How often have you opened an opportunity professionally at a meeting—in terms of a promotion, in terms of opening up your network—to women of color? Secondly, have you really stepped up to go beyond mentorship to sponsorship? By the way, that goes back to my first point, which is opening up opportunities professionally, not just being empathetic.', 'Third, do you publicly recognize women of color, give credit to them for their contribution? All too often, what women of color, particularly Black women, experience is that their judgment is questioned. Do you actually stand up for women of color when their judgment is questioned in the moment, in the meeting, at that time?', 'Another one is, do you confront and question and challenge discrimination? When you see it, do you interrupt behavior that is not inclusive to women of color, as it happens? If you think about these actions, they’re incredibly tactical.', 'There are things that happen at any given moment of the day, and that is where we fall. It is not just the big committee decision to promote a woman of color, although that’s important. It’s also all the grains of sand that hold you back on a daily basis, and that’s where real allies shine. They do it when no one’s noticing, and they’re consistent, and they show up minute-to-minute. If you’re a woman of color, you know who those people are, and you know how few there are in the world.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: We see that women do twice the sponsorship of their male peers in the organization, a phenomenal amount of lifting up of women and men who are below them and rising in the organization as talent.', 'Very often I hear from male leaders, “Well, I’m not sure if I’m the right person to support this woman of color, because I don’t have that experience. I won’t know what it’s like to be a mother, to be Hispanic, in some cases to have a disability, or some other form of intersectionality as well.” And my answer is always, “If you are a leader, you are the person, because if you don’t, then you leave all of that to someone else, and, disproportionately, what we see, to women.”', 'We can measure that women who say they have allies in their organizations show much lower levels of microaggressions, much higher levels of overall support. They’re happier, and they’re more likely to stay. So getting this right is actually about unlocking the key to getting all talent to feel like they have a fair and equal shot and are excited to stay to see that through.', 'Lareina Yee: I think Alexis captured it beautifully. It’s a huge talent unlock. Instead of thinking of this as a risk to be managed, think of this as an opportunity.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Sometimes, I feel that we’ve been talking about these issues since I was in college, and that can feel discouraging. What are you most optimistic about going into 2022, coming out of this Women in the Workplace report?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: I’m most optimistic about the fact that we’re having an honest conversation, and now with a real fact base. We’re not talking about these things as perception but as real and measured experiences that companies can’t hide from—and they don’t want to.', 'As a mother of three young daughters, it gives me real hope because I’ve been thinking about this question for 20 years. But in 20 years, when they’re fully in the workplace, maybe we’ll have a totally different paradigm.', 'Lareina Yee: What we see year over year is that sunlight is the greatest disinfectant.', 'As Alexis said, you can’t escape the facts. That allows us to have a really honest conversation. Sometimes, that’s not very comfortable, but through that process, we’re actually going to get to a better place. So every year, and this year is no exception, I end the research feeling incredibly optimistic.', 'And while the stories and vignettes that you shared are incredibly harrowing, there are also some incredible stories. I met somebody who introduced herself to me at a cocktail dinner party, and she said, “I heard you and some of your colleagues talk about the Women in the Workplace report. I read it. And it was just an outpouring of emotion, of being heard, being recognized, seeing myself, my experiences in the data, knowing I wasn’t alone.”', 'And she’s also a sponsor of other women now. She’s helping five other women. That gives me a lot of hope.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Any example from your own career of someone acting on your behalf as an ally in a way that helped you move forward?', 'Lareina Yee: I was just starting out at McKinsey. I was a business analyst. We had been working really hard on a project, and I was working on my work stream heads down. We were getting ready for an executive meeting with, I think it was, the president of the group, someone very senior. I was so nervous. Again, my nose was in the books, and I show up to the meeting and I sit down, and then the other people saunter in, and I am ready to answer any question. And the president looks over at the table at me and says, “Who is that?” Literally says that out loud. I think he thought I was the coffee person.', 'And so his question and his body language is like, “Why is she sitting down at the table?” And the senior male partner didn’t skip a beat. He looked at the senior executive straight in the eyes and said, “She is in charge of the most important analysis that’s going to fix your company. So we’ll be following her direction at this point.”', 'I was the most junior person in that meeting. Let’s be honest—my piece was one of many pieces that contributed to the growth of the company. But him saying that, not hesitating to assert my value in that meeting, made all the difference. And I’m still so grateful for not feeling like an imposter in that meeting but feeling like I belonged at that time.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And that so easily could have gone a different way.', 'Lareina Yee: The typical thing that would happen is no one would say anything. It would just be a bystander, like, “Oh, well, you know, that was kind of uncomfortable, moving on.” And you spend the rest of the meeting thinking about that moment or coming back to that moment—it does something to your confidence. And it does something to your confidence the other way when someone steps up as an ally. That’s the power, the positive power, of someone actually being an ally to you.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Let me share a personal story of my own about sponsorship. A number of years ago, I found myself as a new parent and in a really challenging project situation [at work].', 'It was a new set of leaders I was working with. There were politics involved, a lot of travel, long hours. It was a really tricky project, and it didn’t go particularly well. And at the end of it, I recall one of my biggest supporters set me down for what I thought was going to be a really tough-love conversation about all the things I needed to improve.', 'It was a moment where I felt really low in my own confidence. And instead, he started by saying, let’s just shake it off. You don’t need to take big lessons from this. Not every moment has to be the one where you knock the ball out of the park. I know you and your potential, and I can see everything great you’re going to do from here.', 'And for me, in that moment, having someone who was really focused on the long game of what I was most capable was the thing I most needed.', 'Lucia Rahilly: That’s really inspiring. Let’s close there. Alexis and Lareina, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today.', 'Lareina Yee: Thank you so much.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Thank you.', 'Lucia Rahilly: For more on our Women in the Workplace 2021 report, look for the link in our show notes or visit us at McKinsey.com.', 'Roberta Fusaro: A flexible work schedule is top of mind these days for many. As it was about 20 years ago when Sven Smit, senior partner at McKinsey, asked for the unusual—time off to care for his young daughter. This is from our My Rookie Moment series, which you can find on McKinsey.com.', 'Sven Smit: When I was an associate, which was a long time ago, we actually still were on a schedule at McKinsey that on Saturday morning, we would have our training days, once every two weeks. They were great fun. We learned a lot, but, you know, it was on a Saturday, kind of atypical if you compare it with these days.', 'And I would also say there was an ethos in the firm that if you were to go home at 6:00 p.m., people would jokingly tell you, “Are you taking the afternoon off?” And for many personal reasons, particularly because I wanted to be with my daughter and help her grow up, I had decided that I wanted to go part-time. I was the first male person at McKinsey that would consider [working part time]; there was one woman before me that actually did work part-time.', 'And, you know, I was young. I had no reputation whatsoever. And I had to explain this to my office manager, who was of the entire spectrum of hard workers, the most hardworking person. And I remember that my feeling was that I would go into his office and say, “I’m going to go work part time, at least. You know, be home on time on Wednesday and Thursday and not be traveling on those days, and Friday take off to be able to care for my daughter.”', 'And I thought he would just basically say, “That’s not possible.” So I had sort of resigned myself mentally to the fact that I would be resigning by saying this. And to his credit, he said, “Well, probably you’re going to do this better than I did. Good luck.” I learned a lot from going part-time and doing it for the first time.', 'This might be a dated story for those of you that hear it now. In 1996, this was quite unusual. At the moment, it’s totally usual. At our firm, it’s not even a question when people bring it up—we know how to do it, and we’re well organized. But at that time, I fully thought I would be leaving the firm by asking the question. And I was proud that this person said, “You’ll be able to do it. Good luck.” And, you know, I had some luck.

20,Diagnosing the pain in your supply chain,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/diagnosing-the-pain-in-your-supply-chain,The COVID-19 pandemic has knocked global supply chains off their axes. But CEOs and other leaders can build resilience into their operations and reset supply chains for the next inevitable disruption.,"['The COVID-19 pandemic has knocked global supply chains off their axes. But CEOs and other leaders can build resilience into their operations and reset supply chains for the next inevitable disruption.', 'Product shortages and supply-chain disruptions continue to drive headlines. On this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Knut Alicke and Dan Swan, partners in McKinsey’s Operations Practice, describe the key cost, labor, and transportation issues facing CEOs and supply-chain managers. In their conversation with McKinsey executive editor Roberta Fusaro, they also suggest ways executives can build resilience into their supply-chain strategies—for when the next major shake-up eventually comes. An edited transcript of the conversation follows.', 'After that segment, hear from early-tenure consultant Oscar Viyuela Garcia, who left academia for a career at McKinsey.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is cohosted by Roberta Fusaro and Lucia Rahilly.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Dan and Knut, thanks for being here today.', 'Dan Swan: Thanks for having us.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So how are supply-chain executives feeling these days?', 'Dan Swan: I heard one senior executive say this is basically the scariest environment imaginable from a supply-chain perspective. Inbound material costs are going up exponentially; some categories or some commodities are up 50, 60, 70 percent year over year, which obviously has major implications on the cost structure.', 'Executives are having real challenges finding labor. We’re also seeing major challenges from a transportation perspective—not only with inbound containers from Asia, but also with finding trucks to carry products. The common refrain is, “I can’t get people. And then I can’t get the product out to my customers.” It’s a scary environment for leadership.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So, what’s driving the labor challenges?', 'Dan Swan: It’s most acute in the US right now, although we see it in other forms across the globe. I think there’s a bunch of underlying factors to this. The job-openings rate is about 50 percent above prepandemic levels. These are literally open jobs that people are having a hard time filling. Finding people to work in your manufacturing plant or your distribution center is a real challenge.', 'We’ve had millions of people actually leave the labor force since COVID-19 started. On top of that, the pandemic has accelerated a bunch of trends that were already happening in terms of technology and automation, which just creates a further gap between the capabilities that some people have, and the capabilities they need to be able to work successfully in this new environment.', 'The other layer that I would add to it that’s very interesting is, pay matters; it’s necessary but not sufficient. So what we’ve seen is that there’s a real mismatch between what employers think their people value and what the employees themselves value. This notion of finding the right purpose aligned with the company that they’re working for? It matters.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How’s Europe doing, Knut?', 'Knut Alicke: We have also a labor mismatch. We did a survey among supply-chain executives, and nearly all of them said they like digital talent. They need this digital talent for planning—for demand planning, supply planning, inventory management, production planning.', 'They want to build up significantly in this area. They are basically doing it in two ways. One is that they have their existing labor force, and they want to reskill. That means teaching existing employees advanced analytics, machine learning, all of this new, cool stuff. Then they’re looking for talent outside the organization. This is clearly where we see a big gap. So, there’s just no one available who could fill these roles, especially in the planning functions.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Dan, what role would you say the pandemic has played in this talent mismatch?', 'Dan Swan: It’s been massively exacerbated through the pandemic. Think about things like the demand for e-commerce. That leads to a totally different supply-chain requirement in terms of warehouse labor, in terms of transportation labor.', 'At the same time, people have questioned, “What are we doing? And what’s the purpose in my life?” I would think of this as more of a trend and a trajectory that we were on that just got put on a massive accelerant, and we weren’t necessarily ready with the infrastructure of solutions. The companies that were further along on that dimension, before the pandemic, have weathered the storm much more effectively than those that weren’t, even though everybody has had challenges.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are any companies successfully addressing the talent gap?', 'Dan Swan: There’s been a shift from people thinking about talent and capability building as an enabler to people viewing it as a strategy in and of itself. I think this is a really important mindset shift for leaders to think about as they try and get this piece right. But there are a couple of things we’d call out. One is getting much more scientific and analytical around why are people leaving.', 'At each company, there’s a specific capability required. There’s specific talent that is helpful to be successful over the medium to long run. What we saw, when people weren’t intentional about that, was just massive attrition.', 'One of the things people are doing is getting much more analytical with their HR capabilities and considering the priorities for both attracting and retaining talent—and what really matters to their people. The second thing is that people are getting more aggressive with capability building. How they’re prioritizing supporting the frontline workforce, upskilling them, having clear career pathing as part of their value proposition.', 'One of my clients built a formal digital academy that was focused on capability building. They’ve been driving this organization-wide transformation at every level, whether that’s infrastructure and technology to actually upskilling the frontline workforce. They’ve seen output of 75 percent in terms of labor productivity. So there’s no silver bullet out there, but people need to be thinking about this problem holistically. Everything from who they attract, how they retain, and how they build the capabilities of their team to be more productive going forward.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Knut, what are CEOs doing differently in the face of supply-chain challenges?', 'Knut Alicke: That’s an interesting question, Roberta. What we saw from our client work over the past 18 months is that supply chain got to the CEO agenda. Before, it was always like supply chain was seen as yes, necessary, but not really sexy. It’s only visible if things go wrong. Now that is different.', 'We had one client that was quite interesting. In his investor briefings, he started to mention supply chain. Due to the pandemic, it’s on their agenda. He mentioned that this makes sure that we get the stuff to our customers.', 'They were even able, as they manage the pandemic better than others, to increase their market share, which was just amazing. So CEOs need to think about supply chain as a clear enabler for their success. They need to think end to end; they need to pay attention to supply chain. For all the issues we saw, and for the issues going forward, they need to make sure that they invest in resilience to make sure that the supply chain can deliver as it’s meant to do.', 'Dan Swan: Knut and I have joked that we’ve never been more popular in our lives than we’ve been over the last 12 months. But I think we’ve seen a real CEO mindset shift. Where oftentimes in the past supply chain was what I would call a necessary evil. You needed your supply chain there to get product to your customer. And now, I think we see it more and more as a real differentiator for companies. I think one of my CEO clients said, “You know, availability is this year’s innovation. If you have product on the shelf, that’s better than any new product introduction that’s coming along.”', 'Oftentimes in the past supply chain was what I would call a necessary evil. You needed your supply chain there to get product to your customer. And now, I think we see it more and more as a real differentiator for companies.', 'The second reason why I think supply chain has become more and more important is because it’s the most cross-functional part of your business. It involves sales and marketing. It involves finance to understand some of the trade-offs you make. It involves manufacturing. It involves procurement.', 'To really get the end-to-end supply chain, you need the whole organization working together. When you have that mindset that it’s a potential strategic differentiator, the role of the CEO and helping the entire organization and the entire leadership team to mobilize around that is quite different.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How are you advising CEOs in terms of productivity versus growth? What are the key messages for CEOs there?', 'Dan Swan: It’s an age-old dilemma of how you think about growth versus productivity. However, I think there are a couple of things that are unique about this environment. Before COVID-19, we were talking about currency fluctuations. We were talking about trade and tariff challenges. We were talking about Brexit and the implications that it would have on the global supply.', 'We’ve had a cargo ship stuck in one of the largest canals in the world. All of that to say, some of the challenges we’re seeing with supply chain that make product delivery on productivity more and more complicated are things likely here to stay.', 'What that implies for our leadership is that people need to think about productivity with a slightly different mindset, which isn’t, “How do I build a supply chain that’s the absolute lowest cost, assuming that everything goes right?” and instead, “How do I build a supply chain that has the right productivity levels for the resilience, in the speed that I want my supply chain to deliver on?” We’ve done some research through McKinsey Global Institute that suggests that every ten years there’s 40 percent or so of one year’s profit that gets lost to supply-chain disruption.', 'On average, that’s 4 percent a year. The challenge is that it never happens like clockwork, 4 percent a year. It’s spiky, and it’s very hard to predict. And so what we’re really encouraging people to think about from a productivity perspective is thinking about it holistically, and assume you’re going to have some challenges. Try to understand what are the high-risk places in your supply chain and build the capabilities around that so that you have a better opportunity to actually deliver on the productivity that your organization needs.', 'Knut Alicke: I would agree with Dan. Productivity will be redefined. The productivity we looked into in the past was always, “Hey, we can improve by 5 percent per year?” Now, we take into account that we will see the next disruption around the corner. It will not be a pandemic; it will be something different.', 'So we need to make sure that we have a resilience setup that is meeting our productivity goals. At the same time, we see a lot of industries that have a lot of growth these days. So, basically, you need to manage both. But you need to manage it with the availability in mind. You need to manage it with a resilience in mind.', 'It’s also interesting that we see a lot of companies these days that are maximizing their margin because they can utilize the productivity they have. They don’t need to give discounts because of the availability. They will also change in the future, which will be a very interesting discussion going forward.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are some ways that CEOs can lead that discussion or think about being more resilient, particularly in supply chain?', 'Knut Alicke: First of all, you set up something like a nerve center. You’ll make sure that you fix your supply issues. You have a couple of people in a room, and they all have phones, and they talk to the suppliers and make sure that stuff is available. This is good to bridge a short-term issue.', 'Then we need to also make sure that we have a midterm solution. So here, business continues. Management comes into play. And what you do here is on a weekly basis; you think about, “Hey, what are the scenarios that we need to solve for?”', 'It might be a plan that is not able to work. It might be that we are in a lockdown. It might be that the supplier is not able to deliver, and you’ll come up with, let’s say, scenarios to evaluate: “Should we increase inventory? Should we move production orders? Should we fly over stuff?” So, that might come with a higher cost and then you’ll decide, “What should we do?”', 'There’s also a structural resilience. You look into, “What is our sourcing strategy?” You need to make sure that you also talk to R&D. You need to design components in a way that you can use them in a different setting.', 'You even might want to talk to your customers—do demand shaping. Be more flexible with this on how you execute. As Dan said, this is where you really need to involve the end-to-end supply-chain sales, procurement manufacturing. You need to have everyone together to make sure that you define this resilience.', 'Dan Swan: The one thing I would say is that every supply-chain executive knows that growth is your biggest friend for driving productivity. It is much more complicated to drive productivity in an environment where you’ve got demand declining versus in an environment where you’ve got increasing demand. So I think we would kind of challenge the notion that there’s a trade-off between growth and productivity.', 'When you’re actually set up to drive productivity, you can often reinvest in the things that are required to drive growth and having top-line performance actually helps you to build a more sustainable productivity platform within your supply chain.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How will this pandemic period affect the way people do their scenario planning?', 'Knut Alicke: In terms of scenario planning, you want to look into your supply and then you come up with different scenarios to solve. You want to evaluate those scenarios from a financial perspective to be able to decide. Now you could say, “This scenario planning is something that we in supply chain talk about for years.” The reality is that it was not implemented to the extent necessary. So we also see companies that were early adopters of end-to-end planning processes, thinking in scenarios, also thinking in probabilities, that are doing better because they now have the options to compare different scenarios. Whereas other companies have struggled to even calculate a scenario and then have no alternative.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there examples of companies that are making these shifts or managing supply chains differently as a result of what’s gone on?', 'Knut Alicke: Yeah. We had one company where we started with the weekly process of looking into how to make sure they had the production capacity available. One important element was the test equipment. And this test equipment needed to have a lead time of something like eight to ten weeks to shift it between the different plans. So we calculated a scenario: “What happens if we shifted to another plant? What would happen?” And another scenario would be, “No, we don’t shift it.”', 'So, we leave it where it is and then evaluate the availability, the service, the financial implication of shifting it over and then decide.', 'Dan Swan: And Roberta, I think one of the things we’ve seen is people take a much more aggressive look at their supply base. We talked to a client of mine early in the pandemic, and they were very excited because they had gone around and said, “Look, we’re in really good shape with all of our suppliers in terms of inbound materials.”', 'And they called a week later and said, “Whoops, actually, almost all of our tier-two packaging companies are in the same region of the world, and they’re having a real challenge.” So this visibility into your tier one—but also tier two, and potentially further upstream—and trying to build more resilience where we make sure we’ve got at least a couple qualified suppliers, versus having all of your eggs with a single supplier. The second thing we’re seeing is, I think we had a survey early in the pandemic that said something like 60 percent or 70 percent of companies were thinking about shifting manufacturing capacity around. Only about 10 percent or so of them have gotten around to doing it so far, just because those aren’t things you do in days and weeks.', 'A company I know has shifted a meaningful portion of their manufacturing base from Asia to North America. The idea being that they’re not going to put 100 percent of their capacity in North America, but to have the flexibility, when things go wrong, to have more of their production in the same region as their customer base. And then the third thing we’re clearly seeing—Knut hit on this—was this notion of real transparency. How do we have real-time visibility to what’s actually happening with our supply chain?', 'There were companies that would do monthly or even quarterly reviews of their supply-chain performance. And now our people are moving to daily or even hourly reviews of performance, because a week and months are too long in this environment that we’re living in, given all the variability.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I did want to turn our attention now to this topic of inflation. In what ways is inflation playing a role in supply-chain pain?', 'Dan Swan: This is very simple and very obvious, but when inflation happens, the cost of the input materials goes up meaningfully and creates real pressure on the P&L [profit and loss]. And some companies have a better ability to pass on price than others.', 'So you see, how much of your cost increases can you cover by passing through pricing to your customers? And how much are you left holding the bag on, and then what can you do about it? I think it’s very simple and very obvious, but it has real, meaningful implications on overall company performance.', 'The second thing we see from an inflation perspective is it can lead to really interesting decisions. When the Texas freeze happened, you had a major implication on production of polyurethane in the US. Typically, it’s a product that can regulate the pricing discrepancies across regions.', 'But what we’ve seen is, for that product, massive increases in price in the US and relatively stable pricing in China. In traditional times, we’d fix that by bringing product from China to the US. Companies would shift decisions around how they think about sourcing. Well, the reality is, in an environment where you can’t get containers of anything from China, and it’s really expensive to get stuff over, it’s led to an actual discrepancy in terms of the cost between the different parts of the world, which is a really unusual phenomenon, in terms of a global supply chain.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are we seeing different sorts of impacts in different parts of the world or is this just sort of a common thread across all countries and sectors?', 'Dan Swan: The short answer to your question is yes. What I mean by that is, everybody knows about semiconductor shortages or steel challenges. Basically, transportation costs are up across the board and then there are places where there are pretty meaningful differences across the globe.', 'And then there are places where even in one part of the country, there can be major differences in terms of the inflation of individual products. So for food products and commodities, what’s happening for row products? Row crops are very different than fruits and vegetables. How it actually manifests itself is a pain for everybody, but it’s varying levels of pain depending on what products you make and where you’re based.', 'Roberta Fusaro: When we look back on this time, will this mark the point when people started to manage their supply chain differently?', 'Knut Alicke: I hope that we will look back and say, “There—we finally understood it.” To give you an example, we’ve had crises before. Fukushima was ten years ago. When we prepared to help our clients, we basically took the stuff that we developed ten years ago, and we found that, “Hey, this is still valid.” So why did companies not apply this on an ongoing basis? And it’s very clear, you kind of manage the crisis; the crisis is over and you go back to normal. This is what we also see here. Now we have a boost of digital. We have the boost of resilience.', 'In ten years, hopefully we look back and say, “This was really the start of our accelerated digital journey to significantly improve the performance of our supply chain.”', 'Dan Swan: Ten years later, what I think will be interesting is, will people follow through on some of the bigger structural changes that will set them up more strategically going forward? Things like product design. You can design a product that’s much easier to source and have much more resiliency.', 'Also, more sustainable products from an environmental perspective. There’s a whole bit of, “Are we actually going to redesign our new products to be much more resilient, much more sustainable, much easier to operate from a supply-chain perspective? Are we going to build our networks, whether it’s manufacturing or distribution, to have much more resiliency?”', 'Think about the trade-offs of the absolute lowest costs, conceptually, versus the practical costs that you’ll pay when you have disruptions or you have to expedite things across around the world. Things like strategically, what is the role that supply chain will play in terms of productivity, like what we talked about earlier.', 'I’m quite confident that some of the specific things in the more short-term actions that people have taken will manifest and continue to live on. I’m really hopeful that the rubber will also hit the road on the bigger structural changes that people are talking about.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Thank you both for joining today.', 'Dan Swan: Thanks so much for having us.', 'Knut Alicke: Thanks a lot.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Now it’s time to hear from Oscar Viyuela Garcia, a consultant based in Boston.', 'Oscar Viyuela Garcia: I did a PhD in physics before joining the firm five years ago. I spent almost three years working as a researcher and faculty member, first at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and then at Harvard. My topic was quantum computers. In trying to find practical applications of this technology, there have been many times where I’ve arrived at a client and I’ve said, my background probably doesn’t align perfectly with what these guys are doing.', 'Many times our clients have industry experience of around 20 years. I think the more I’ve done it, what I’ve realized is that what I’m bringing to the table is the ability to solve problems fast and communicate those findings in a way that people can understand and that is meaningful.', 'For instance, I did this project for a big retailer in the US to build a loyalty program from scratch. Part of the work that I did was to understand when a customer purchases something at a very specific time, what are the elements that make that customer come back again? How long does it take? How valuable is that customer? All that information is a lot of data. Now it’s problem solving with the entire team and also with our client. And another piece of it was predicting or forecasting—what was going to be the financial impacts? And that’s something that first of all, coming from a scientific background, is not super hard to learn, and you can actually be good at it.', 'The tricky part is to be able to work with different teams and to be able to communicate well. For instance, I was serving a client in a telecom company where we’re developing a new app for them. There had been a previous version of that app that a business unit had owned. I needed to work with one of the leaders in that business unit and basically to learn the key elements of what they have done and eventually transition the tool to a different business unit.', 'I noticed a lot of pushback and not trying to help from the client. The bottom line was not that the client was not a nice person and didn’t want to help. But probably the clients felt threatened because something they owned was going to leave that business unit and go somewhere else.', 'We seemed to be the bad guys who were going to do that. So, just understanding that, which took me a little bit, allowed me to approach the problem in a different way. Because then it’s more about, where’s the person that I’m talking with coming from? Empathy. Because if you fail to understand the human side, the personal side, then it can be tough for you at times to make progress. At the end of the day, it’s all about people.']","[[-0.44433594 -0.921875    0.7788086  ... -0.77734375 -1.484375

An edited version of their conversation follows. After, hear from John Doerr, venture capitalist and author, about his fresh ideas to combat climate change.', 'The McKinsey Podcast is hosted by Lucia Rahilly and Roberta Fusaro.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Today on The McKinsey Podcast, we’re here with Shelley Stewart III. Shelley is a McKinsey partner, a leader of the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, and an author of a wide range of publications, including a recent McKinsey Quarterly article on the $300 billion opportunity in serving the emerging Black consumer. Hello, Shelley. Thanks so much for joining the show today.', 'Shelley Stewart III: Hello, Lucia. Thank you very much for having me.', 'Lucia Rahilly: I’d like to start by reading out loud the first sentence of your Quarterly article on the Black consumer, which lays out a fundamental premise underlying the research: “For decades and decades, Black consumers have been regularly overlooked by companies that don’t see them as a priority demographic.” I find that super powerful. But consistently and over time, companies have simply not made this community a priority. What do you think is going on here?', 'Shelley Stewart III: I certainly won’t say that the generalization is true for all companies. But what I will say is the Black population is around, call it, 13 to 14 percent of the US population, so it is a minority. And so, in some sense, it makes sense that on initial pass, they might not be the priority group.', 'That said, if you actually look at the spend, today Black consumers spend around $835 billion a year, but that number is about 10 percent of overall consumption, so it doesn’t quite reach their population shares.', 'But $835 billion is a huge opportunity spread across all the different consumption buckets, and we fundamentally believe that, and our research supports it, there’s a huge opportunity to get more focused on this consumer segment.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Yes. And presumably, White people spend proportionately more. Do we have stats on how spending breaks down by other racial and ethnic groups?', 'Shelley Stewart III: If you look at the data, the consumer buying power tracks much more closely to population share, and for White Americans, even above population share. Some of this is just the mirror effect of having lower wages than the population share and just being underpaid and not in the occupations that tend to provide more income and, therefore, more consumer “spendability.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Theoretically, then, the logic for companies, financially, has been smaller population, smaller paychecks, maybe smaller discretionary income, and all that presumably adds up to smaller profits. Is that right?', 'Shelley Stewart III: I think certainly the starting logic is that it’s a smaller pool than maybe some other segments of the population. That said, there is a huge opportunity to identify these pockets of opportunity where you can disproportionately focus. And, actually, our analysis and our conversations with the Black consumer suggest that there is an opportunity to build greater loyalty and disrupt some of the existing incumbent players in some of these markets.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Yes. It seems that what the research actually shows is what seems like a fairly massive number—$300 billion untapped opportunity. That seems big on its face, but maybe you can help us put that figure into context. Is it actually a lot for B2C companies?', 'Shelley Stewart III: The first thought is we talk about the $300 billion opportunity for the Black consumer in the context of the $835 billion of spend that’s growing. So certainly $300 billion is easily on the table based on our research.', 'The majority of that $300 billion opportunity that we identified is already being spent today by Black consumers. The issue is that they are significantly dissatisfied with their spend across almost all categories when you compare them with other populations.', 'So we view that portion of the $300 billion to be at risk if you are currently serving those customers. About $50 billion of the $300 billion is an expressed willingness to pay more than what they’re paying today if they could have products that were better tailored to suit their needs and expectations. That represents a real commercial opportunity to, again, disrupt existing providers, and even provides opportunity to earn more and increase profitability in some categories, if you better serve the needs of the Black consumer.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s set some more context by talking through the five areas where Black communities are underserved. The research homes in on five categories.', 'I’m assuming this is also where the biggest upside lies, and those five areas are food, housing, healthcare, broadband, and banking. Would you walk us through two or three of those in more detail, and help us understand where companies might have the fastest and most beneficial impact?', 'Shelley Stewart III: Absolutely. The three that I’ll take are what I’d consider things that are really essential goods and services to living a life that’s of any type of decent quality: food, housing, and healthcare. Our analysis found that one in five Black Americans, or around 8.3 million, lack easy access to fresh food.', 'So 40 percent of individuals in that 8.3 million are concentrated in five states where they’re living in food deserts. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity to help address this access issue. And part of what we did in our analysis was to look in certain census tracts that are food deserts and used one of McKinsey’s proprietary retail models to ask, “If you put a store in this location, should it be profitable based on a set of attributes?” And we found that there were clear opportunities to locate profitable grocery stores in these locations.', 'On the housing side, this is something that came up time and time again in our surveys and discussions with the Black consumer. There’s huge opportunity to develop higher-quality housing product in areas where Black Americans live. In fact, that was one of the areas where Black Americans would be willing to pay a fairly substantial premium to what they’re paying today, if they could have higher quality housing in the areas where they live.', 'And lastly, healthcare. There’s a three-and-a-half-year life expectancy gap between Black Americans and White Americans. That gap actually extended to five years, unfortunately, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of this comes down to access to healthcare providers. There’s certainly an affordability question, but 16 million Black Americans live in areas where there are few healthcare providers, which is two and a half times the rate of White Americans.', 'This has all sorts of downstream implications for being able to be educated. It’s difficult to learn when you’re sick and you don’t have adequate healthcare and coverage. It certainly has implications for employment. So across these areas—food, housing, and healthcare, we think there’s real opportunity for the private sector, and some opportunity also for the public sector, to come together and better serve the Black consumer.', 'Lucia Rahilly: As an aside, you mentioned the pandemic and the devastating effect it has had on Black Americans. Acknowledging that first and foremost, COVID-19 has obviously also accelerated digital uptake. Has the spike in, for example, digital grocery delivery had any kind of meaningful effect on ameliorating lack of access to groceries? And the same could potentially apply to telehealth, but I don’t know if that’s getting traction or taking effect or not.', 'Shelley Stewart III: I am optimistic at the opportunity that is created by a wider embrace of digital in things like fresh food, and things like telehealth, and things like remote education as a way of augmenting these physical services that are also necessary in these communities.', 'That said, one of the core issues that we identified is that more than half of Black Americans live in broadband deserts. So if we are going to collectively capitalize on this opportunity, we’ve got to address the broadband-access affordability and the device challenge that is largely impeding this kind of progress in the Black community.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Right, and you see housing and broadband, two of those categories, converging in a really sobering way during this pandemic in the area of kids’ education, where we saw the education gap just widen considerably. So sometimes it must be important to think about these categories as they overlap with each other.', 'Shelley Stewart III: There’s tremendous overlap. Unfortunately, we found in the data that there’s also tremendous overlap in the deserts. So, places that are banking deserts, as you said, are also often healthcare deserts and fresh-food deserts.', 'There is an economic case to be made to get rid of these deserts, but we have to reimagine the way we think about situating our footprint. We need to expand the aperture and the attributes that we use to determine what is an attractive market. If you’re not in these markets today, and your decision framework only incorporates attributes that look like markets you’re in, then it’s very hard to get out of that cycle. That’s what we’re trying to get folks thinking about on this topic.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Gentrification also becomes a factor, right? We were talking before we started this recording about my in-laws who live in the Detroit area. One of the examples that you used in your article was a Whole Foods in midtown Detroit.', 'Afterward you started to see shops opening up on Woodward Avenue and so forth, and some of them became high-end, luxury shops. That raises a question about displacement, and gentrification, and rising prices. Do those factors have to be taken into account here?', 'As neighborhood conditions improve, we need to find creative solutions to allow incumbent residents to benefit from and stay in place should they feel inclined.', 'Shelley Stewart III: Absolutely. As neighborhood conditions improve, we need to also find creative solutions to allow incumbent residents to benefit from and stay in place should they feel inclined. And I don’t think those two things always have to be in such vicious conflict.', 'I think we can be creative about how we think about the housing stock and how we think about real estate and residential development and what the allocation is between affordable versus market rate. And we have to be deliberate about this, because the problem doesn’t get solved if the neighborhood improves but the old residents who were suffering from these deserts don’t get to participate in it.', 'We’ve talked about this idea of inclusive growth, and it is a fundamental paradigm shift that I do think will benefit society broadly. And I don’t mean just through greater harmony and people feeling more included. I think economically, inclusive growth will be better for everyone as measured in GDP terms.', 'Lucia Rahilly: I’m interested in your own experience. Both of us live in Brooklyn, one of the five boroughs of New York City, and I believe you live in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is historically a Black neighborhood with some of the most beautiful, heartbreakingly gorgeous housing stock I’ve seen. It’s been gentrifying for a long time. How do you experience consumer deserts, food deserts, banking deserts in Bed-Stuy?', 'Shelley Stewart III: What I would say is, I’ve lived all over New York City, everywhere from the Upper East to the Upper West to Midtown West to the Lower East Side to Carroll Gardens. And in purchasing a home in Bed-Stuy—which I was very excited to do because I love the diversity of the area both in terms of the way people look and the income diversity—I didn’t spend a lot of time up front thinking too much about this idea of deserts.', 'I knew that things would be a little bit different from other places I’ve lived, but I was surprised by just how different it is. My walk to the nearest branch bank is two times as far than in any other place I’ve lived. I can say the same thing about the nearest pharmacy, and as for grocery stores, there are actually a few. So it’s significantly harder both in terms of access and quality.', 'I will also say that the consumer experience in some of the stores in the neighborhood is also different in a way that I think we need to continue to think through, in terms of the security protocols and just things that I think make it challenging. There really are some basic human-dignity things that come to light that I hadn’t experienced while living in other parts of New York City.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s turn from where these opportunities sit to how B2C companies can start realizing some of these win–win benefits and this trajectory, as you referred to, of sustainable inclusive growth. I want to mention what I found to be a pretty striking statistic in your research about the percentage of marketing managers and even marketing research analysts who are Black.', 'That statistic was abysmally low in both cases, somewhere in the ballpark of 6 percent. That would suggest that awareness and knowledge of this demographic may be lacking, right? So, let’s talk at a very high level about what Black consumers look like and how they tend to spend. How brand loyal is this community?', 'Shelley Stewart III: If I had to generalize, I would say the loyalty is up for grabs. Because of the level of dissatisfaction, our analysis suggests that Black consumers are 25 percent more likely to switch brands. I don’t believe that is because of any intrinsically lower likelihood of being loyal to a brand. It speaks directly to the level of dissatisfaction relative to other consumer groups. And, again, we talked earlier about the willingness to pay a premium in some instances to have products that are better suited. So if I had to summarize the Black consumer today, I would say, “A bit neglected and a bit underappreciated.”', 'And that shows up in their spending behavior, which means there’s a huge opportunity for incumbent players to realize this but also for new disruptors to come in and say, “We’re not going to take you for granted as a consumer group, and we’re going to create and tailor products and meet you where you are as the Black consumer.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: If you were to paint the most broad-strokes picture of the Black American consumer, what would you highlight? What’s different about this consumer demographic from Whites or from other consumer segments?', 'Shelley Stewart III: If I think about the Black consumer, there are a few things that I note. One, Black consumers are younger. The median age of Black Americans is 34. That’s a decade younger than the median age for White Americans. Two, they’re more digitally plugged in, more engaged with their smartphones.', 'And three, they’re more brand aware. There are a number of implications that come from that. On the skewing younger, that means that if you can get these customers today, you can have a long life of engaging with these customers—the customer-lifetime value. And it’s likely that those incomes and consumption behaviors will grow over time. So there’s vested interest in getting in early. The second point on smartphones is you know how to reach them. You know where they are. So that can inform your marketing and customer acquisition in a very deliberate way.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Now, let’s talk about some examples. Tell us a couple of ways that companies have successfully prioritized the needs of Black communities and what the benefits have been.', 'Shelley Stewart III: We have seen examples of companies, large and small, make inroads by prioritizing the Black consumer. So if I think about access, Whole Foods—the example we just talked about—has done an excellent job in neighborhoods that maybe have traditionally been food deserts, of situating their locations in these places that have helped to transform neighborhoods.', 'Home Depot is another good example. There is a Home Depot in the middle of Bedford-Stuyvesant, and you would never think that a large-format store like that could figure out a way to make that work, but it’s there.', 'I do believe that there are leaders in this space, and there are case examples that should be learned from. The other side of it is meeting Black consumer preferences. You’ve certainly got what I call “native” Black-owned and -run brands such as Bevel that tailor their offerings to Black men, and Fenty Beauty, similarly, which has been valued at billions and billions of dollars. Those examples prove that the economic case really is there.', 'And then there are entertainment companies. One example that comes to mind is Starz, which has really leaned into Black content, and they’ve had a number of major hits. You’ve seen it on the entertainment side, but there’s substantially more opportunity across all categories.', 'Lucia Rahilly: On the one hand you just talked about some issues with product-to-market fit, right? And Black consumers being dissatisfied with products, and new companies or new brands meeting satisfaction in terms of product development. What kind of opportunities are there for big brands in simply marketing current products differently?', 'Shelley Stewart III: Consumers, no matter who they are, want to be seen in the branding, in the marketing. So there is no doubt in my mind that you can move someone from the very front end of being aware of a brand, to feeling seen in that branding and in that marketing.', 'Consumers, no matter who they are, want to be seen in the branding, in the marketing. So there is no doubt that you can move someone from the very front end of being aware of a brand, to feeling seen in that branding and in that marketing.', 'The good news is that that is not zero sum. You can have lots of different groups show up in that marketing and show up in the overall branding and accrue those benefits. And some companies and some sectors do this better, but across the board, there continues to be opportunity.', 'One financial institution that I’ve seen do this on the retail-banking side has been very deliberate in engaging with influential people in the Black community, and then developing marketing collateral and a plan that resonates with Black banking customers.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Are there any risks to navigate as companies consider entering this space? Or common areas where you’ve seen some efforts go wrong?', 'Shelley Stewart III: It has to be authentic. And part of that authenticity, Lucia, gets back to this point around who’s in the room as you develop the content. You’ve got to have folks with lived experience who are helping to develop and to ensure that the obvious pitfalls are avoided.', 'And I think if you do that, and you do that in good faith, there is minimal risk. The only thing I’d add there is ensuring that the products that you’re serving and that you’re bringing awareness to are a good fit for the demographics that you want to serve. The last thing we would want is for the idea to be, “Let’s market things that are not appropriate products or that could somehow extract rather than create value in these communities.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve seen a rise in recent years in big brands collaborating with individuals, right? Do you see a rise in that?', 'Shelley Stewart III: I haven’t looked at it specifically, Lucia, but I do think there is an opportunity. And what I would say is, “That’s fantastic, but how do we build some knock-on ecosystem effect so that when those big brands are benefiting, some of that value is also accruing to the communities that are the new loyal consumer?”', 'All those things come together in what should be a virtuous cycle, bringing in a new loyal customer base, hiring folks who help you better understand that customer base. To do that, you need to situate and locate in areas where those folks live and buy from businesses that are located and hiring in those communities.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Do you think we’ll see that trend in creating new offices in geographies where Black communities are disproportionately concentrated?', 'Shelley Stewart III: I am hopeful, as you said, based on some of the shifts and new dynamics that we now are starting to understand around remote work as a result of what we learned during the pandemic. I think there’s also increasing recognition by the philanthropic community that place-based transformations are probably the next real horizon, where you’re going to places.', 'Rather than pulling one lever in ten places, such as education, you go into one place and you pull a bunch of levers. You focus on job creation, entrepreneurship, education. I do think that broader recognition of the role of place should augment what we learned from COVID-19 and help people who care about this recognize that that lens is a really important lens to take if we’re going to help make transformational change on this topic.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve heard so much over the years, and particularly in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder last year, about moral commitments to Black Americans. And in the research we’ve invoked the term or described these opportunities as “moral opportunities.” It feels like in the past, I’m sorry to say, it’s not clear that morality has proven to be a strong motivator. Why might it motivate behavior change now?', 'Shelley Stewart III: I may be a wild optimist on this one, but I believe that one of the big takeaways from COVID-19 is that in many ways we share one another’s fate. And so if you take that broader collective lens, in the case of COVID-19 it was our health and well-being, and what one person did affected another person.', 'If you take that through the economic lens, you recognize that we want our fellow citizens to do better economically because that is better for all of us. The moral overlay there for me is a recognition that we are all linked, that we are all part of the same system, and that it’s not zero sum. Because I think all of us feel empathy and compassion, and I think what gets in the way of that for us sometimes is the notion, “But it’s zero sum.”', 'I’m hoping that we start to move beyond that. The other trend that emerged long before COVID-19, but I think is starting to accelerate, is this notion of stakeholder capitalism beyond the bottom line of any individual company where the shareholder returns.', 'You are starting to see that show up more and more in the way investors are talking about how they make investment decisions. You’re seeing particularly Gen Z and millennial employees talk more about that. I am hopeful that the broader definition of what success looks like for an individual institution is some sort of collective or corporate morality that acknowledges that, yes, we should be focused on institutions being profitable so they can thrive, and serve customers, and spend money with suppliers, but that that, in and of itself, is not the end of the story.', 'Lucia Rahilly: That was McKinsey partner Shelley Stewart III talking about the $300 billion opportunity serving Black American consumers.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Coming up, we hear from venture capitalist John Doerr. He’s just written the book, Speed & Scale: An Action Plan for Solving our Climate Crisis Now. Find a longer version of his thoughts at McKinsey.com in our Author Talks series.', 'John Doerr: There’s no guarantee we’re going to cut our carbon emissions in time. We’ve got a very, very long way to go and we’re not moving nearly fast enough, but here’s a few things that give me hope.', 'First of all, there’s tens of millions of climate activists who are now getting mobilized. The second reason for hope is the commitments of Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 global companies to reduce or zero out their emissions as early as 2030.', 'Third, there’s the potential for really radical innovation to make clean energy more affordable. Finally, there’s pressure from employees, shareholders, and investors. There is $29 trillion of investor capital now committed to push corporations for sustainability.', 'At the world’s current rate of carbon emissions, we’re going to cross the red line into irreversible climate damage in less than seven years. To reach to carbon net zero, which is the only way to control global warming, we can’t just decarbonize the grid, or electrify transportation, or improve our food systems. We’re also going to literally have to pump, the estimates are, five billion tons of CO2 underground every year.

22,The economic impact of ageism,https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/social-responsibility/the-economic-impact-of-ageism,New research quantifies the struggles that midcareer workers—those 45 and over—worldwide face and suggests possible interventions to level the playing field.,"['New research quantifies the struggles that midcareer workers—those 45 and over—worldwide face and suggests possible interventions to level the playing field.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Mona Mourshed, global CEO of the independent nonprofit organization Generation, joins Roberta Fusaro, McKinsey executive editor, to discuss findings from Generation’s recent report about the state of midcareer workers. The organization surveyed 3,800 employed and unemployed people, as well as 1,404 hiring managers from seven countries including Brazil, India, Italy, Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The responses revealed a consistent pattern of bias against workers aged 45 and older across geographies; they also suggest actions business leaders can take to hire, retain, and retrain this cohort of employees. An edited transcript of the conversation follows.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Mona Mourshed is the global founder and CEO of Generation, a nonprofit organization that provides free job training, placement, and support to help people find life-changing careers. Mona, thanks for joining us today.', 'Mona Mourshed: Thank you.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Just recently, you and your colleagues at Generation released a report that looks at the plight of workers age 45 and older. The findings suggest that people in this cohort are struggling, particularly those looking for entry-level or intermediate positions. What’s the employment situation for older workers in the US and elsewhere? How exactly are they struggling?', 'Mona Mourshed: When you look at the long-term unemployed across Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] countries, what you find is that 40 to 70 percent of them are age 45 to 50-plus. The reality is that once you hit a certain age, it becomes much harder for you to be employed.', 'When we surveyed people who are aged 45-plus across seven countries, 63 percent had been unemployed for more than a year, versus 36 percent for those who are age 18 to 34. So there’s a very stark reality that employers perceive you and your capabilities very differently when you’re age 45-plus, particularly when you’re seeking to switch into a new career.', 'Roberta Fusaro: When this cohort struggles or faces these challenges, how does that affect the global economy? How does that affect society? What are the impacts of this form of ageism, if we want to call it that?', 'Mona Mourshed: We should absolutely call it that. When you look at what will happen from the year 2050, you’ll find that four in ten people are actually age 50-plus.', 'This cohort is the most educated and has the best healthcare outcomes of any other time for this age cohort in history. For the world to not be able to take advantage of the productivity and expertise of this population is tragic—let alone what it means for their own personal lives—if they’re unable to have opportunity and financial independence.', 'Roberta Fusaro: We mentioned the term ageism. One of the more interesting, paradoxical findings from the report is what hiring managers are saying about older workers. They view them as being less valuable as hires, and yet they speak very highly of those currently in their organizations. What’s that all about? How can those two perspectives exist simultaneously?', 'Mona Mourshed: Yes, that was one of the most strident findings in our research. We asked hiring managers, what are their perceptions of job candidates in the different age brackets of 18 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45-plus? What happened is that hiring managers, and this is across sector and across seven countries, consistently said they perceived only about 15 to 18 percent of the 45-plus candidates they saw to be a fit for the roles for which they were hiring.', 'Then we asked, for those age 45-plus who happened to be hired, somehow managed to get through, what’s their performance on the job? It turns out, 87 percent of those individuals are performing as well, if not better than, their younger peers. Ninety percent of them are viewed as having long retention potential, if not more so than their younger peers. That right there is the definition of bias. It’s when you see exceptions to your perceptions, yet the bias prevails. That is tragic.', 'What was also quite stark was that this perception bias was absolutely universal across all seven countries in our sample.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I find that point, again, fascinating. I guess I would have assumed there would be industry-specific factors, cultural factors, geographic factors that come into play, but the findings were consistent?', 'Mona Mourshed: Absolutely consistent, and the same magnitude as well. It wasn’t just that it was higher or lower, but it was the exact same magnitude. This, to me, is one of the great tragedies of what we’re seeing, and this is why we should call it ageism. We are absolutely seeing ageism.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are some interventions leaders can take to bring the 45-plus worker into the fold? Not just bringing new employees in, but also retaining and retraining existing older workers?', 'Mona Mourshed: As is the case with any “ism,” this is something that takes decades to work through. We identified a set of interventions. In particular, it begins with simply understanding, if you’re an employer, what is the actual performance of different demographics in your company.', 'Then second is ensuring that the fact base is also well understood at the hiring-manager level. There are many industry coalitions, CEOs, that call for intergenerational diversity, greater inclusion, in the talent they hire. But the reality is that it doesn’t trickle down, in many cases, to the hiring-manager level.', 'That awareness, first and foremost, is important. We must examine how the interview happens. When an interview is done through a traditional CV screen, many of the age-45-plus people just automatically are getting screened out because they’re not fitting the type or they’re not fitting the algorithm that’s currently being used.', 'Many of the age-45-plus people are automatically getting screened out because they’re not fitting the type or they’re not fitting the algorithm that’s currently being used.', 'In our own programming, we find it’s absolutely critical to use demonstration-based interviews—whether that is sharing the graduates’ portfolios or having them demonstrate the job task in some way. All this, instead of sitting across the table and talking about their relevant job experience—which, in some cases, if they’re shifting to a new profession, they don’t have. Demonstration-based interviews are the second thing we really pinpoint.', 'The third thing is just simply being very clear about language. We would often find words like, is this candidate agile enough? Is this candidate going to fit in with our culture? Is this candidate going to be savvy? These are all trigger words, which are different ways of saying this person is too old to understand technology or to be able to do this or that.', 'Those are biases. Those are perceptions. Find ways to test it instead of assuming it.', 'Roberta Fusaro: There was another point in the Generation research discussing the importance of training and the fact that a large percentage of midcareer workers need training, but many are reluctant to enroll in classes or to move forward with that training. What’s preventing folks from getting the training and new skills they need?', 'Mona Mourshed: First, let me just describe why training is important for midcareer workers. In our sample, we included a group of midcareer workers who had switched careers in the past three years. For example, they were working in logistics, and now they’re working in tech.', 'For that group, about 75 percent said that profession-specific training was absolutely critical for them to be able to make that career shift. Then, in order to support them to make a shift, we asked the unemployed midcareer respondents whether they are keen to engage in training. We found that 58 percent of them said no. You look at that and on the face of it and you say, well, you know, that doesn’t make sense, but, frankly, people make decisions for very rational reasons.', 'When you look at who said no, 70 percent are struggling to make financial ends meet. About 60 percent had a secondary-school education, alone. A significant share had been unemployed for at least a year. You take those things together, and what that says is, for many of them, education was not a great experience.', 'The traditional K–12 education failed them in many ways. They’re not rushing to go back into an experience that, from their perspective, was negative. Second, they need to be able to feed their families. One of the questions we had asked was, “If you had a living stipend during the training, how would that change your perspective of engaging?” And 40 percent said it would.', 'They also have concerns about, is it worth it? Is this worth my time? If I put in the effort, and I’m in a training for X number of months, what’s the ROI of that? We found 60 percent said that if there was a job interview or a job guarantee, then they would partake. It’s really important to understand the reasons why we see this phenomenon for this segment.', 'At Generation, we preconfirm the job vacancies. We recruit our learners. We then have the boot camp in parallel. We have the social-support services. Then, once they complete these steps, they interview with our employer partners. It’s deliberately holistic to be able to bring this population into the program, such that you overcome the hesitation they previously had.', 'Roberta Fusaro: There also seems to be a point here, as you were just describing, the role that Generation can play from end to end, right? I’m thinking about employers: there are benefits, I guess, to targeting the 45-plus worker that would also redound to the rest of your workforce. I’m imagining that’s the case. Is that so?', 'Mona Mourshed: The reality is that we must embrace an intergenerational workplace. The demographics are as such. I will also say, youth have different biases in the workplace that they confront. There’s often a perspective, this person’s too young; they don’t have the right level of maturity. Are they really going to stick with us? In many ways, our youth and our midcareer workers need to be able to work together in a much more integrated way to be able to change the workplace context, because no employer is going to be able to get the best out of their talent unless both youth and midcareer workers are successfully working side by side with each other.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there any findings about the impact of automation on 45-plus workers and more vulnerable populations?', 'Mona Mourshed: When we look at automation and digitization, there are two effects. One is there are new types of jobs being created. Conversely, there are some jobs that are no longer in as much demand. The nature of job tasks in given professions is also changing. What does all of that mean? If you are aged 45-plus, there is a likelihood that you are going to have to shift to either a new role or shift to learning a whole new set of job tasks or confront the reality that the job that you had for the last ten years is no longer going to be with us. All of these things are creating pressures that lead us down the same path, which is: How do we support an age-45-plus person to be able to enter an entirely new career?', 'One of the things that really struck us is, there’s actually very little global programming geared toward supporting the age-45-plus for those shifting into new careers. There’s also not so much research on this. There’s certainly been what I’ll call the demographic, so, the macro research. But, at the actual employer level and at the programmatic level, what are the actual interventions that are necessary to change this? There hasn’t been so much. Again, just given the way the demographics of the world are shifting, we have got to do better to figure out now how to support this population. Otherwise, we’re going to be inundated with—I’m sure, the many articles you’ve seen as well—the silver tsunami. There’s all these apocalyptic articles and reports about what’s going to happen to pensions, rising healthcare costs, et cetera.', 'We have an opportunity to change that, but this is the moment. This is the moment where we say, this matters. We’re not going to neglect any longer supporting the age-45-plus to enter new careers. We do it systematically.', 'Roberta Fusaro: It sounds like this lack of global programming might be an area where we need to dig in some more. But just wondering if anything else struck you as areas for further development or more research?', 'Mona Mourshed: A couple of areas. One, as I mentioned earlier, is the fact that the trends were so universal. We also had expected that there would be some variation by country, but that was not the case. So ageism is real. It is global, whether you are an emerging market or you are an OECD country.', 'The second thing I’d say is, we really felt a strong level of despair among the age-45-plus. So 66 percent of those who had successfully switched careers had to compromise significantly in terms of the pay or the sector or role they wanted or in the work hours, et cetera. You just feel there has been this tremendous pressure on this population. There’s a level of desperation that, frankly, is even higher in some cases than what we see with our youth population. That’s obviously tragic.', 'The last thing I would say is if you are age 45-plus and you identify with an underrepresented community in your particular country, we found that you had to do two to three times as many interviews just to get a job offer as those who were not. That also is a finding that weighed on us, because what’s coming together is almost like a double whammy of what you now have to contend with in terms of bias in the hiring process.', 'That, again, just speaks to the importance of doing demonstration-based interviews and actually really understanding what does someone know how to do as opposed to your perception as an employer of what you think they can do.', 'Only about 50 percent of companies actually consider age to be part of their DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] strategy. Naming that age inclusion is an important part of diversity and inclusion for the strategy of the company is any immediate thing that can be done. Second is really understanding the experience and the performance of different age brackets, particularly when it comes to entry-level and intermediate roles in a company. And then reflecting that in terms of how hiring happens.', 'My final point here would be to say, demonstration-based interviews, be they through a portfolio, be they through demonstrated job tasks, is absolutely critical.', 'Roberta Fusaro: I’m happy to see there’s potentially a trend in that direction. You’ve mentioned this surprising sense of despair. Maybe it’s not so surprising, really, among 45-plus workers. Is there more to say about that? Is there more that either the report reveals or that other research reveals about how to cope with that?', 'Mona Mourshed: We understood it was there. That’s going to be the topic of our follow-up research coming next year. We’ll be doing some testing on the employer interventions as well. On the basis of the research we conducted and published this summer, we’ve now committed to doing follow-up research next year, where we’re going to take several of the phenomena we found and go several levels deeper. Then, we can identify what I’ll call a suite of micro interventions that employers can undertake, that policy makers can undertake, and that workforce program practitioners can undertake. This issue has just been prone to so much neglect, unfortunately. Many of us across the world need to now be focused very heavily on what are the actual changes in programming and policy that can redirect the trajectory for the age-45-plus population.', 'Roberta Fusaro: We’ll be looking forward to that. This has been a fascinating conversation, Mona. Thanks so much again for joining us today.', 'Mona Mourshed: Thank you for the invitation.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And now, we have a story as told by senior partner Eric Kutcher. He experienced an early and painful lesson on how to be a better leader.', 'Eric Kutcher: I was a very young manager, and it was very clear I had no idea whatsoever what that meant. One of the first lessons I realized is, what I thought was a good manager didn’t necessarily mean I would be a good manager for someone else—that the way I learned and the way I wanted to be managed could be totally different.', 'One of the first lessons I realized is, what I thought was a good manager didn’t necessarily mean I would be a good manager for someone else.', 'Because I was young, I was actually first asked to manage a summer associate that was probably five or six years older than I was. What worked for me is, I would go to our managers, almost as if I was a student to a teacher, and I’d present my work for the day. They would sit down and go through it, and they’d hand it back to me with a series of questions. Maybe if there was something that was worthy of a discussion, we’d do it, but there were a bunch of edits, and I loved it. It was a way for me to learn, to see the types of things that I should have asked myself. And I learned from those markups.', 'So I had this summer associate, who was, as I said, about five years older than me, who had no interest in being managed by someone younger, none whatsoever. And all the things that I thought were fantastic, she hated, like, literally hated.', 'So the first two or three interactions with her, I would sit in my corner of the team room. She would sit in hers. She would bring the pages to me. I’d take them, put them right in front of me, and I’d sit down and start to make a bunch of edits. Then I’d hand them back, and she’d kind of look at me, like, what the heck is this? Like, why would you think that this is actually managing?', 'Here I was, thinking this was going to be the most inspiring . . . and then, I got my first upward feedback, and it was abysmal. I mean, just awful, because I had done nothing to get to know her. I had done nothing to understand how she wanted to learn, how she wanted feedback, what would be most inspiring to her, what would give her the confidence to do better, what would make her feel like the work she was doing was appreciated.', 'I had made all these assumptions about what worked for me, that it must work for everyone. Again, because I was young, I just hadn’t had many experiences, and it was a real eye-opener as to how different people, different styles, and how you as a leader, you as a manager, really have to adapt to the people that you are managing as opposed to them adapting to you.', 'I think that was my big aha.', 'Mona Mourshed is a McKinsey alumna and the global CEO of Generation, an independent nonprofit organization founded by McKinsey; Eric Kutcher is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office; Roberta Fusaro is an executive editor in the Waltham, Massachusetts, office; and Lucia Rahilly, global editorial director of McKinsey Global Publishing, is based in the New York office.']","[[-0.1616211   3.2148438  -0.3005371  ...  1.5976562  -0.5517578

An edited version of their conversation follows.', 'Roberta Fusaro: In our recent research, you found that employers think employees are leaving the workforce or are dissatisfied due to a bunch of different reasons—compensation, work–life balance, poor physical and emotional health. What’s interesting is the findings showed that while these issues mattered, there were other issues playing a significant role in driving this employee exodus that we’re seeing. What were some of those issues you found in the survey?', 'Aaron De Smet: “Do I feel valued by my organization? Do I feel valued and acknowledged by my manager? Do I feel a sense of belonging with my organization and my part of a high-performing, trusting, open, caring team, with teammates that I like to work with? Do I have potential for meaningful advancement in my career? Can I have flexibility and autonomy in my workspace?”', 'A lot of employers don’t pay nearly enough attention to those things. They’re paying more attention to things like, “Am I paying people enough?” “Is this the best comp and benefits we can offer relative to competitors?” Employees say those are important, just not as important.', 'Many people are leaving the job they’re in without another job in hand; they are just leaving. They’re burned out, and they’re looking for inspiration, social connection, belonging. When they don’t find this, they’re just quitting.', 'Roberta Fusaro: On the flip side of the survey findings, we also see that about 60 percent of respondents say they aren’t likely to quit. But, you guys say business leaders and managers should not take comfort in this. Why is that?', 'Bill Schaninger: Many of the people in charge can’t conceive of a situation where people would leave without another job in hand, but the workforce is saying, “Oh, no, I’ll leave.” I think we’re just not tuned in to the dynamic going on for current employees. Parent, teacher, partner, caregiver—all those worlds have been smashed together.', 'People have had this intense time at home, and they’re waking up and questioning why they need to resume business as normal, particularly if it comes from the top without asking. That just feels like a violation. So I think the dynamic here is wonderful, in that employers are being forced to reckon with what employees have just experienced.', 'The leadership assumes there’s a return to the office, and I think they’ve been repudiated quite a bit. So now’s the time for a little bit of a “let’s hit pause and restart about how we’re going to reengage the workforce.”', 'Aaron De Smet: If you create the right thing, you can keep the people you have because they’re there. Many of them are running away. They’re, like, “I’m feeling burned out. I’m feeling stressed. I’m feeling anxious.” There’s just more and more change and uncertainty. They want flexibility and autonomy and connection and belonging. And a lot of these people are saying, “I want to connect in person with colleagues. I just don’t want my boss to tell me my schedule is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. That’s not working. I have a life at home that I’m very invested in.” They also have a different lifestyle and they’re looking for something more from their employers. And when they’re not getting it, they just need a break. But when people step out of the workforce and take a break, it adds to a labor shortage more broadly.', 'If you have 40 percent attrition, that is phenomenally high. If even half of those people don’t take another, similar job, you’re going to find massive labor shortages across industries in those types of jobs. Just paying people more, while it might be table stakes, is by itself not sufficient.', 'Bill Schaninger: It’s so much easier to blame the employees than for their employers to take responsibility for their leaving.', 'Aaron De Smet: Another thing employers get wrong: employers think that employees want the ability to work remotely and that there’s some magic number of days per month or days per week that employees are looking for.', 'If you ask employees what they want, they say, “No, actually I’m OK with you saying I need to be in the office however many days a week, as long as there’s some logic. But I want flexibility to decide which days in which hours I come in.” And, again, this goes back to the conditions we’ve created. Understanding what is important to employees means you can turn it around and create a more desirable environment, not only to keep the ones you have, but also to start attracting other employees from other places, who are also leaving their jobs, in many cases, without another job in hand. In fact, some employees are starting up side gigs as a “passion project.”', 'Bill Schaninger: Record number of small-business starts last year.', 'Aaron De Smet: Exactly. And they’re saying, “I can be my own boss. Now, if I could find this at an employer, I would do that.” And this is, again, where there’s this huge opportunity to shift from the great attrition to the greater attraction.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How can business leaders make the environment that much more inviting and help people want to come back?', 'Bill Schaninger: The opening salvo, and the communications for much of the return to work, started with some presumption that the employer could dictate the terms. That was absurd. You just spent 15, 18 months having people work from their kitchen tables, work from their bedrooms, while their kids are trying to do some schoolwork. I mean, talk about a basic violation. When the people feel they’re not being treated like a person, it starts feeling transactional.', 'You know, if the work dictates an intense amount of collaboration up front, it should be OK to be up front about the need to work together, in person, for several days in a row. I think people would accept that. I think you have to figure out the unit of work. Is it individual contributor? Is it small team or is it department? What’s the fighting force, if you will, and solve for that.', 'There’s a give and a get to this, at its core. It’s an exchange. And, you know, it’s a relationship. Employers would have done better to come out with some understanding that it is still a little crazy. You know, so long as you have employees who have kids, who need to go to day care, go to school, or elder care that needs to be sorted out—if there’s even a sniff that those things might close up again? They’ve got to know it’s OK to call “time” and go back to doing what they’re doing. Anything that comes out like a monolith and goes “thou shalt,” they’re gonna walk away from it.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How does geography play a part in job satisfaction or in this whole notion of the great attrition?', 'Aaron De Smet: Even as people are coming into the workforce and saying, “I’m likely to work for more employers over the course of my career,” they’re also saying, “I’m likely to move from one city to the next for an employer less often.”', 'So what does that tell you? That tells you that people are picking where they want to live, the communities they want to live in, where they have friends, where they want to raise a family. And they’re saying, “I’m going to live here. And if my employer doesn’t let me live where I want to live, I will find a new employer.” That was prepandemic.', 'Now, with the pandemic, you have people showing they can work remotely and be reasonably productive. You have teams that have formed that are much more agnostic of geography, without any clear expectation of travel.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Does this moment in time require a new set of leadership competencies to create more empathy or create more of this relational environment for employees?', 'Aaron De Smet: If we try to manage output or activity, is it better to write 20 emails or ten? Well, 20 is twice as much as ten. If you’re creating a presentation, 20 slides is twice as much as ten slides. I think all of us would say, if you can get higher-quality information with fewer words and less output, that’s better.', 'What we care about is what functionality is delivered, what better user experience is delivered, what results are delivered in the code you write. And if you can deliver the same user experience and functionality and features and results with half the amount of code, that’s better. But the only way to do that is to shift your mindset to “I need to manage results.”', 'We need to manage for impact, outcomes, and results—not activities. What if they’re goofing off? Well, if you really manage for outcomes and impacts and results, you don’t care how they spend their time. You want to see the results, and you don’t need to look over their shoulders and see that they’re typing.', 'Bill Schaninger: Just on this thing around the leader behavior. I don’t think it’s particularly new. I mean, don’t be a jerk. Don’t think that you get to impose your will because you’re afraid to actually treat people like equal humans, not as subordinates.', 'Aaron De Smet: Leaders are also humans, and they also are going through anxiety, uncertainty, grief, fatigue, burnout. They are likely to have fared better than most. They will have the agency, the autonomy, and the financial resources to be less burned out than most. So the first thing is to be aware of that.', 'For a lot of people in your organization, it’s harder. It’s likely that if you’re not careful, you will default to using the tactics that have served you in the past, even if they no longer serve you in the world of a pandemic. Are you trying to exert your control and get back into your comfort zone? In fact, that is exactly the wrong thing.', 'Bill Schaninger: We have a generation of leaders in the last gasp of that form of control. They’re largely folks who were raised by boomers, mostly men, with someone to take care of their children. They’ve been allowed to work, and work is a disproportionate amount of their identity. We’ve seen that happen as organized marriage has gone down, as well as participation in civic organizations and organized religion. Their identity is tied up with work.', 'Now, they have this little inconvenient problem of their employees not playing ball. Leaders might want to reconsider the actual nature of their relationship with those employees. They’re not servants. They’re not there to do your whim. They’re there because they have a purpose. They have an identity. We’re not saying it’s not hierarchical for work allocation, but it certainly is egalitarian when it comes to being human. We’ve just had an experiment that said you can relax controls, such as when you show up, so long as the work and the outcomes are getting done.', 'We are all humans in a rather crazy environment, trying to figure out how work fits in. If you don’t accommodate that, the employees are going to make it simple for you because they’re not going to be your employees anymore.', 'We are all humans in a rather crazy environment, trying to figure out how work fits in. If you don’t accommodate that, the employees are going to make it simple for you because they’re not going to be your employees anymore.', 'Aaron De Smet: Let me put the current inflection point into a historical perspective. If you roll the clock back several centuries, work was largely agrarian. It was artisans and farmers, and it was the Industrial Revolution that changed everything about how work gets done. What happened in the 1700s is that people went from the fields to the factories. A lot of this was ushered in by a book published in the 1770s called The Wealth of Nations, by Adam Smith, who talked about standardization of work and division of labor.', 'The Industrial Revolution created enormous wealth and unheard-of productivity improvements. It was determined that to collaborate at that scale, they needed someone to lower the transaction cost of collaboration by essentially taking on leadership and saying, “I will pay you a salary, and you will do what you’re told. That’s the deal. We are going to enter into a contract, a legal employment contract, where I pay you and give you benefits and assure some level of safe work environment. And you as the worker then do as you are told.” By the way, that created an enormous middle class that didn’t exist before.', 'But working conditions at some point had people working seven days a week, 140 hours a week. And people said, “Ah, that’s not productive.” Actually, there’s a production decline. There are safety issues. Labor organized. Even industrialists and big companies said this isn’t helpful. That’s where we get the five-day, 40- to 48-hour work week. It came from the Industrial Revolution—perfecting a model that is now antiquated.', 'Bill Schaninger: It’s also born from an economist’s view of the employee, which was, by and large, the economic exchange. “Do what you’re told because I pay you.” It’s not until you started having people asking for things like loyalty, contribution, you know, the extra above and beyond kind of stuff. But it’s useful to point out that you had two centuries of “Do what you’re told”—not to mention, “Our mental model for you employees is you as a cognitive machine and homogenous. It’s plug and play. You are one of many.” It’s no wonder you had the rise of labor as a disintermediator because it was faceless versus those with power. The essence, the bedrock, of our system is economic exchange.', 'Aaron De Smet: But now we’re in a world where we’ve hit a tipping point. The tipping point is transaction costs are now low enough that you can have a gig economy. We can create technology-enabled platforms that allow us to have collaboration at scale through nonemployees or quasi employees.', 'Now there were some economists who said that when transaction costs fall enough, the large employed workforces will go away. That was the prediction. I never agreed with it, because another reason why people work for a company is the relationships. It’s because of the sense of belonging. It’s because of culture, what the company stands for, and a sense of shared identity.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So as we return to the office, return to work, how do business leaders create that sense of identity? What are some tactical steps that they can take?', 'Aaron De Smet: You still have to have a competitive salary. But it’s not enough. Now, employees are saying, “I want to know what you stand for. I want to know who you are. I want to know what the culture’s like. I want to know what the people are like. I want to like the people I spend time working with. I want to still have a life at home. And I want to know that you support that.”', 'I think it’s time for companies to start questioning why don’t we have more flexible work options? Why can’t somebody work four days a week? If employees are able to deliver the same output and outcomes and results and impact in four days a week, what does it matter if it’s three days a week? Why don’t we have job sharing? Why don’t we have halftime employment options? “Yes, you can work two to three days a week, because you want to spend more time on whatever else you’re doing.” Why isn’t that an option?', 'Roberta Fusaro: So in this world of flexible work schedules, how can companies run productive meetings?', 'Aaron De Smet: Some of my clients have tried out different methods. They’ve said, “We’re going to have a meeting, and it’s important for everyone to be in person.” Or “We’re going to say it’s not important for everyone to be in a room together. In that case, we’re going to have everyone dial in or everyone be by Zoom.” Some people will argue that if half the employees are all in the same office together, why not go to a conference room? But, no, even though many employees are in offices next door to each other, if not everyone is present in person, everyone should go by Zoom.', 'So far, most of the companies I’ve talked to that have tried this have liked it. Some of them have adopted a principle of being thoughtful and intentional about choosing between a videoconference, phone, or in-person meeting. They avoid a situation of a few individuals trying to dial in remotely when everybody else is in person.', 'Roberta Fusaro: How important is it to have a test-and-learn culture?', 'Aaron De Smet: I think it’s very important because there’s too much we don’t know about the future.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Are there specific tactics?', 'Aaron De Smet: I think number one is to encourage people to explore and try things out and not be afraid that it won’t work perfectly. The other is to track and measure what’s working. A lot of companies have really good, interesting data, and some just don’t have any data. You also want to create an environment where it’s OK to share lessons about what’s not working.', 'Roberta Fusaro: So failure is an option.', 'Aaron De Smet: Well, I mean, sometimes we hear this thing about “embrace failure. Failure is good.” Actually, it’s not that failure is good. I, at least, don’t like failure. I like working with people who don’t like failure. But there’s a difference between not liking failure and having failure be taboo and not discussed or shared or learned from. If you never fail, you probably aren’t being bold enough.', 'You know, one of the articles I wrote recently with [Harvard Business School professor] Amy Edmondson was about psychological safety. So I was chatting with her and I’m, like, “How did you ever come up with that?” She had a theory that more effective healthcare teams would have better patient outcomes, but one measure of team effectiveness was the error rates of the team. She found an inverse correlation: the teams that were reporting more errors had better patient outcomes. OK. Now, notice what I said, though. The teams that were reporting more errors were having better patient outcomes. It turns out, the reason for that was the other teams were having just as many errors; they just weren’t reporting them and learning from them. Thus the notion of psychological safety was born.', 'You know, Google had this big, huge project about what’s the strongest predictor of team performance. And the number-one, strongest predictor of team performance was psychological safety. So if you want a test-and-learn environment, you have to make it OK to share failure, so that not only can I learn from failure but others can learn from my failure, and they don’t have to make the same mistakes I made.', 'Roberta Fusaro: What are the more successful companies doing to create a sense of belonging for employees?', 'Aaron De Smet: They’ve moved from emphasizing their mission, which is what do we do in the world, to their purpose, which is why we do it. So engagement is not enough anymore. It used to be. I would argue that now, the companies that do this well look at a much more robust, multifaceted view of the employee experience that goes beyond satisfaction.', 'Bill Schaninger: For sure. Through most of the last three and a half, four decades, we’ve changed our approach to developmental experiences throughout childhood. In large part, it was to reward kids for their participation in order to avoid the disappointment of perceived failure. My point is we’ve raised two generations of folks who believe that participation and the collective is the end result. I think we’re seeing things in the workforce for people who value the collective way more than the people running the place do. People are asking questions like “Should our mission just be about killing the sneaker company that’s bigger than us?” or “Should our mission just be defeating the big, bad software company?” We should not be surprised. They’re saying, “Your ideas and your identity around winning just aren’t enough for me.”', 'We may end up being the better for it. We’ve clearly hit a bump in the road where the people running the place are so materially missing the points. I mean, I thought the data in this article was just remarkable. How far off the mark leadership is, and either how little they thought of their employees or how little they understood their employees by thinking everything was transactional.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Some organizations are sending out surveys. They’re doing pulse checks to see how their employees are feeling. Are these interventions useful in making the work environment feel less transactional?', 'Bill Schaninger: When people claim they have survey fatigue, they’re not tired of you asking them. They’re upset about you not doing anything with it.', 'There’s people tailoring things to us in all parts of our lives. Mass customization is real, and the data’s all there. We used to joke that Facebook knew you were having an affair before you did—you know, whose page you’re going to, who you’re liking, et cetera. Your music-streaming service can see your mood based on the music you’re choosing. We have all of that data about employees. We just have to care enough to do something with it.', 'Aaron De Smet: And then tailor the experience. They want more community. They want more connection. They want more flexibility. What we found is teams with psychological safety and a supportive work environment actually benefit from being edgy and pushing to do better. But you put that same edge, that same kind of push, on a team that doesn’t have psychological safety or an open and supportive work environment, and it has the opposite effect. It actually makes the team go into a sort of anxiety attack.', 'What we found is teams with psychological safety and a supportive work environment actually benefit from being edgy and pushing to do better.', 'Roberta Fusaro: Is there any way that we go back to some prepandemic period, or is this just the way it is?', 'Aaron De Smet: We’re not going back. A lot of these trends were already in place. I heard an executive say, “Why can’t we just go back to 100 percent every day in the office?” And I said, “You mean seven days a week?” “Well, no, obviously not seven days a week, only five days a week.” “Well, which days?” “Monday through Friday, obviously.” “Why Monday through Friday?” “Well, that’s just how it is.” I’m, like, “But that’s a social construct that didn’t get codified until the late 1800s, as a result of the Industrial Revolution. We are living in a completely different economy. Why would we default to a 40- to 48-hour, five-day-a-week work week that was built in the 1700s and 1800s? Why is that the obvious answer other than that’s what you’re comfortable with, because that’s what you grew up with?”', 'And the executives said, “Isn’t that just how it should be?” I’m, like, “I don’t know. But I do know that all those norms have been broken. They probably have persisted a lot beyond their usefulness, just because everybody was used to them, and they kept passing on from generation to generation.”', 'Bill Schaninger: Some companies are going to hear these messages, and they will be determined to do this anyway. They will find their labor costs rising, their attrition increasing, their employer brand plummeting, and they will pay more and more for people who care less and less about them and what they do. They will have a completely mercenary workforce. And that will all be because they’ve had a death grip on what they thought control was. It’s not going to work. It’s done.', 'Aaron De Smet: All these people are looking for something different, and if you offer that, you will attract talent like you won’t believe.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Speaking of talent, our next guest recently left McKinsey to pursue her PhD, but before she did, she stopped by with a great client story to share. Here’s Fernanda Alcala.', 'Fernanda Alcala: The way I manage myself at work comes from something I started doing in my childhood. My mother always found it very curious, but whenever she gave me my plate of food, I would always start with the item I liked the least and then leave whatever I really wanted toward the end. I think that’s a very similar approach to the one I apply to work: whenever I’m trying to plan my day (and I actually appreciate very much the flexibility that McKinsey gives you), there’s no strict schedule. My mornings will always begin with the work that I’m dreading. And then toward the afternoon or the evening, I’ll be in my happy place and doing all the work that fills my soul.', 'I was born, and I grew up, in Mexico City, which is Mexico’s capital. It’s a very noisy, very fast-paced, very crowded city. I grew up with that, so it’s okay. It feels like home.', 'I have been at McKinsey for almost five years.', 'When I arrived at the firm, I was actually in a very different role than the one I’m in right now. The role I had was very much in the shadows—quoting models and sending back results. That changed completely. We became consultants, client facing, to be part of problem solving.', 'There’s this anecdote. It was the first time I really felt that even though I was junior, my experience, my knowledge, and my ideas were extremely valuable.', 'It happened like this: I was staffed to a project. It was a feminine-hygiene-product company—you know, pads, tampons, et cetera. So I arrive to the team room on Monday, and it’s all men, which was interesting, to say the least. All right. I say hi to everybody. The partner was there; everyone was there. Then the partner asks me, “Do you use our client’s products?” And me having absolutely no filter because I was very junior, I said, “No, no way. I would never (laughter).” Then I said, “Okay, please let me leave a little bit early today. I’m going to go to the supermarket. I’m going to buy a bunch of different things so you can actually see the product.”', 'The next day I just put a bunch of different brands on the table. When the team started opening the products, which specifically were pads, they touched them. Then they started saying, “Oh, this feels like little sheep, and this feels like plastic.” Once they were done, I said, “Okay, well, imagine you need to wear that for five days every month. Also, you’re bleeding, and it hurts.” And everyone said, “I want the sheep, right? I don’t want the plastic.” And it was at that moment that I told them, “Well, our client is the plastic.”', 'I must tell you, our client has this spectacular marketing campaign, and they dominate the market. That was a very interesting thing, because the project kind of steered a little bit due to that. Because then it was very marketing centric. And that day I thought, well, you know what, I’m the youngest person in the room. I’m the one that has the least work experience. But I’m also probably the most valuable person right now, because I can offer this perspective.', 'Lucia Rahilly: To hear more of The McKinsey Podcast, subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, or wherever you listen to your podcasts.

24,Centered leadership creates connection in turbulent times,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/centered-leadership-creates-connection-in-turbulent-times,McKinsey’s Joanna Barsh discusses how you can become an effective and engaged leader.,"['McKinsey’s Joanna Barsh discusses how you can become an effective and engaged leader.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Joanna Barsh speaks with Diane Brady about the lessons of centered leadership amid the pandemic. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. You are in for a treat today. I’m excited to speak with our guest, Joanna Barsh, who is director emeritus at McKinsey and someone for whom the label leadership guru is justified.', 'I first met Joanna a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, somewhere in Midtown Manhattan, when she was generating buzz for a book called How Remarkable Women Lead. From there, she led the launch of centered leadership at McKinsey, which spawned a book and programs that have since been adopted worldwide. Joanna continues to help governments and businesses, and we’re very lucky to have her here today to talk about leadership, centered and otherwise. Joanna, welcome.', 'Joanna Barsh: Thank you. If you heard a guffaw, that was me when you said guru. It makes me think of Yoda. As I age, I’m turning greener and smaller.', 'Diane Brady: Ha! Remind us what centered leadership is all about.', 'Joanna Barsh: In a nutshell, centered leadership is mastery of your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions in pursuit of profound change that you’re hoping to enact in the organization or community in which you lead. What that means is to be at your best more of the time, to feel that you’re both grounded but able to get above the fray.', 'It means that you’re operating from strength. You have a positive framing of the situation. You feel connected to the people around you. You’re fully engaged, both your right and left brain. You’re energized, too, and that energy is contagious to others.', 'Diane Brady: You started this program, if I recall correctly, for women. What was it that we needed that we weren’t necessarily displaying or internalizing from a leadership point of view?', 'Joanna Barsh: It goes way back to myself, in the sense that I thought, as a senior partner at McKinsey, that I was missing something very, very big. I couldn’t see what it was. Nobody was pointing it out to me. So I went on a personal journey to interview senior women top leaders from around the world who had what I didn’t have.', 'I started from that place of assuming that I was missing something and if I found it, I could share it with everybody because it would be of value to others as well. By the time that journey was halfway over in 2007 or ’08, with about 100 women interviewed, I realized that I wasn’t missing anything.', 'These women leaders were unbelievable. I was in love with every one of them. There was this river of strength flowing through all of the women and over to me. I learned that we’re not missing anything. We can unlock doors to find more of our own potential hidden away within ourselves, and we can choose to share that or not. It’s our choice. Men have the same opportunity as women. It’s not that we are all that different.', 'Diane Brady: Yes, that’s true. There was a lot of demand, wasn’t there? Weren’t the men sort of lobbying to get in?', 'Joanna Barsh: Yes. I spent the first five years trying to understand how women and men are different, which sounds ludicrous in 2020. Of course we’re different.', 'Diane Brady: I can never decide if I’m surprised at how far women have come or disappointed that they—or should I say we—haven’t done better. Where do you stand on that?', 'Joanna Barsh: I am both hopeful and quite ready to lead the charge to get more, to get it faster, to help more women. I’m hopeful because if you look at the data, we have come very far over the past 20, 30 years, the “we” primarily being white women. The women of color less so, but they’re still making gains.', 'When you look at today, we’re in a perilous position with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting how many women were able to stay in the workplace and still take care of their kids. We’re also at a point in time where we have to recognize that the world of business has not been fair, and the world at large has not been fair to Black women in particular. So we have to do something, and do it big and bold, starting at the top with leaders.', 'We have to recognize that the world of business has not been fair, and the world at large has not been fair to Black women in particular.', 'Diane Brady: There does seem to be this dearth of leadership or an angst over leadership right now. What do you see going on?', 'Joanna Barsh: We are in the midst of social unrest in the US, the likes of which we haven’t seen since the ’60s. We have economic uncertainty like crazy, and we have half the country on one side of politics and the other half on the other.', 'We’re divided in so many fundamental ways that it’s a very difficult and challenging time. Leaders, say, ten years ago, just had to figure out how to get their companies to grow more profits and shareholder returns, pay off the shareholders, and earn a lot of money, and then decide what boat do they want to buy, and on and on.', 'It was pretty simple compared with today, even though it was crazy with globalization and so many other issues that leaders had to cope with. Today, leaders are drowning in the level of complexity that they face. The only way through it is to let go of the transactional nature that we were all taught in business school and to adopt—it sounds hokey—a more humanist set of practices as a leader to deal with the emotions swirling around us. The fear, the grief, the anger, the outrage, the shame, the guilt, the embarrassment, the humiliation. I could go on. I’m bumming myself out.', 'Diane Brady: When you go into the corporations around this country and around the world, are you seeing a lot of changes? Are you seeing a wider swath of leaders?', 'Joanna Barsh: I am, but that could be because the corporations that call me up want something else. They want centered leadership or more of it than perhaps they’ve found on their own. So I am seeing leaders who are much more self-aware than I’d seen in the past, meaning they’re more curious about what they’re feeling, sensing, and observing in the organization.', 'I’m also seeing people who are open to new ways of doing things. The latest research that I’ve been doing on Black and Latinx men and women who work in line jobs has suggested that we need a radical reset in the organization to enable more of the talent to rise. The leaders I talk to are curious about it, but also willing to try things that maybe they wouldn’t have given a second thought to a couple of years ago.', 'Diane Brady: What do you think will actually be different if I’m talking to you this time next year, or maybe in two years?', 'Joanna Barsh: The only thing that will change senior leadership, unless they themselves change, is if they become self-aware of what’s driving them and self-aware of how their behavior affects others. Let’s just take a simple example. You’re trying to hire somebody, and you’re pressured to fill that job very quickly. You also feel pressured to hire the person who meets all of the criteria of the people who used to have that job. You end up with a white guy, and he’s probably fabulous. But the criteria in that job is changing because the world is changing. The future of the job needs a broader set of criteria.', 'If you were to use a broader set of criteria, you wouldn’t be stuck hiring somebody who looks like the person who was just in the job. You might hire somebody who doesn’t look anything like anyone on that team but who has genuine leadership skills, who has strategic ability to look around the corner, who has a set of interpersonal skills that you didn’t think you needed ten years ago—but you need them now. In that case, you have a much broader talent pool to look at, and you’re going to diversify.', 'Diane Brady: You don’t think it’s human instinct? I often wonder about “mini-me syndrome”—that instinct to recognize excellence in a form that vaguely resembles yourself.', 'Joanna Barsh: That’s a real thing. There’s even a term for it: familiarity bias. You hire who you are. It could have worked in a system that’s stable, where you’re not feeling the pressures buffeting the company, the pressures buffeting the social system of the country, and the pressures that your own employees bring.', 'The one thing that’s really changing is you can’t close your eyes to the fact that your employees want to be heard and are going to push harder today than they would have done ten or 15 years ago. As they push, it’s going to make it a lot less pleasant if you have not developed the capability to hear them.', 'Diane Brady: Has your thinking on centered leadership evolved as you’ve seen it in practice?', 'Joanna Barsh: It has. The first five or so years that I was working on centered leadership, I worried about whether it would really help people. Then I saw that it was helping people discover their strengths, learn how to shift from a moment of upset to a moment of opportunity.', 'It was helping people make important connections at work to create sponsors for themselves and others. It was helping people take on new risk, and it was helping people gain clarity around where they get their energy from and where it goes and how to better manage it.', 'So the people who adopted centered leadership were more resilient. They seemed more fulfilled, more energized, and they were getting promoted, which was a cool outcome. But there were a couple of things that just did not sit right as the world evolved. The first that I was stuck on was this notion of passion. Back in 2004, everybody was talking about passion.', 'Diane Brady: Do what you’re passionate about!', 'Joanna Barsh: Right, follow your heart. I even wrote it in the book. I feel ashamed every time I think about it. Follow your heart. So I’ve learned, and it was a young woman, a millennial, who taught me. I remember her well because she dyed her hair purple and had a visible tattoo. I was curious about the question that she posed because she seemed like such a strongly expressive individual.', 'She asked, “What do you do if you don’t have passion? What does that mean for you at work?” I didn’t know what to tell her. The pat answer was, “Keep looking for it. It’ll find you, or you’ll find it.” I heard about passion or the lack of it more and more and more after that. I do think that there are a set of circumstances at work and in the community at large where you can be stripped of whatever passion you have. It’s called low-grade depression. A lot of people in America have it today because of COVID-19.', 'But what do you do if you don’t have passion? I’ve started to grapple with that. A second one, and this one I thanked COVID-19 for, is what do you do when you’re just filled with negative emotions and everybody’s telling you to put a smile on your face, particularly if you’re on Zoom calls all day long: look positive, or else! I’m not feeling positive. I’m feeling upset and ashamed and angry and just powerless, all at the same time. So what do I do?', 'Diane Brady: Should we express all that on our Zoom calls? I don’t know.', 'Joanna Barsh: Actually, you should. There’s one company that said, “Start your Zoom calls with not just, ‘Hey, how are you doing?’ in which case the only right answer is, ‘Fine,’ or ‘Great,’ but to say, ‘How are you really, really doing today?’” Then shut up and listen. If the person says, “You know, not good,” give them the space and stop yourself from a tendency that we all have to say, “Oh, it’ll get better,” or, “You should be happy because the day is sunny.” We do this to each other all the time. We shame each other into positivity.', 'Diane Brady: It still seems like a difficult thing for a leader to admit to anxiety, sadness, or all the other emotions that one feels.', 'Joanna Barsh: That’s right. But I know from everybody, from Brené Brown to Barack Obama, that when leaders show vulnerability, they gain power. People want to follow a leader who opens up a little bit. It’s an element of trust that means if you’re afraid to do it, you’re at least self-aware that you’re afraid.', 'Then you can go into an introspection around what is it that’s making you afraid and how can you work around that, welcoming the fear, allowing it to settle. It will pass through you because you’ll recognize that it limits you. If you want to connect, if you want to get more out of your people, then you’ve got to show some vulnerability. It is one of the most powerful tools that a leader can use.', 'If you want to connect, if you want to get more out of your people, then you’ve got to show some vulnerability.', 'Diane Brady: You mentioned passion and the fact that we may not need it as much as we think. So what keeps us connected? What keeps our companies vibrant and growing, or whatever success looks like in the next iteration, if we don’t have people who are engaged and passionate about what they’re doing.', 'Joanna Barsh: We tend to think in black and white. So if you don’t have passion, that must mean that you’re on automatic or perhaps you’re an automaton, a robotic person. That’s not true at all. Putting that aside, you might have a passion for gardening or for playing volleyball after work. It’s not that you’re a passionless person. It’s that you don’t have a passion for looking at spreadsheets all day or sitting in 12 hours of Zoom calls. And that’s OK.', 'You do have to find a different way to recover your energy because the lack of passion also means lack of energy. Think about passion as, what is it that you value? What is it that just fills you up with positive energy? Can you do a little bit more of that at work? It doesn’t necessarily have to be a task. It could be an interaction with a colleague. I’m having a blast talking to you right now. It’s filling me with energy. I feel passionate about centered leadership, and I like your questions. So I’m having a moment. From here, I might have another Zoom call where something else is happening and I don’t feel it anymore. That is OK.', 'First, recognize that it’s normal, and then think about skill building. Think about contributions that you’re making to others. Think about what you’re grateful for and appreciative of, regarding yourself, not just of other people. Pretty soon, you’re going to find more energy creeping back into your workday.', 'You have to focus on it for it to come. You have to invite it in. It doesn’t typically creep on you from behind. Finding the work that you love may take a lifetime to do, and I think the pressure we put on our children to find it at 18 or at 22 or at 26 is just wrong. It takes a long time for some people. I did not know I wanted to be a consultant when I was five, when I was ten, or when I was 26. I just took that job because it was a job I could get.', 'Diane Brady: Well, it’s not a bad job to get.', 'Joanna Barsh: I loved it in the end.', 'Diane Brady: You wrote a book for millennials that I think was inspired by your daughters, if I’m not mistaken. What is unique about that generation that made you feel you had to reframe the message somewhat for them or even give a different message altogether?', 'Joanna Barsh: I think the world is so much harder today, and we parents and leaders, managers at work, are using the rubric that we grew up with and trying to retrofit it onto these people who are living in a far more global, complex, fast-moving, uncertain world in which they’re unlikely to make it in the way that we made it.', 'If you look back to—I’m a young baby boomer—that time, we all believed we could do anything. You could do it whenever you wanted. Whenever you stopped taking illegal drugs, you would decide to go back to school and become somebody. You could just make up the job. In a lot of ways, people were creating their futures or believed that they could. That’s really hard to do now, even though entrepreneurship is a very, very strong vector for today’s young people. The challenges that they face, while they seem similar to the ones we faced, are so much greater.', 'For example, the lack of passion. A lot of people are in jobs that they really don’t like, and they turn around, they get laid off. They see their parents getting laid off and not being able to find work again. That’s scary. What about working for not just a person you don’t like but a person who’s a genuine bully or jerk? Bob Sutton, a professor at Stanford who I adore, wrote a book called The No Asshole Rule book. It should have been required reading for every corporate executive.', 'Diane Brady: That’s not unique to millennials or Gen Z, where my kids sit, or Gen X, which is my generation.', 'Joanna Barsh: That’s fair, but the number of jerks has multiplied in the world because jobs have multiplied over the last god-knows-how-many years. None of us were trained to become great managers, and people are really not trained to become great leaders, other than in a few companies that are known for their training, McKinsey being one of them.', 'I’m proud to have come through the McKinsey training and to have contributed to it. But just imagine being 28 years old, put in charge of a task force that’s global, with 200 people on it whom you’ve never met and never will meet because, of course, you’re not going to be traveling. Suddenly, you have to figure out how to make this brand-new project work and get all of these people to do what you want them to do. It’s a really hard challenge. I don’t think I ever had to do anything like that at 28.', 'Diane Brady: For many 28-year-olds, that may sound like a dream job. As things have gotten more nasty, brutish, and short outside the walls and windows of our offices and our homes, is it harder or easier to be a centered leader? What do you do?', 'Joanna Barsh: One of the things that I’m finding is very helpful is that it’s bringing me back to take care of myself. I am a little bit sick and tired of overused words like self-care. They come from a place of genuine good intention, but I’m not talking about sinking your feet into a bath of cream or whatever. What I am thinking about is the daily practice of setting intention, of practicing appreciation for the day, for yourself, of practicing gratitude. Which sounds so hokey because we’ve seen it now on greeting cards and all over the internet.', 'Practice three good things every day: What is it about today that struck you, that makes you glad to be alive, that makes you feel love and energy, a presence? That, I think, is very attuned to centered leadership. But there’s another piece of centered leadership that’s quite important.', 'I’ve always been fond of connecting as one of the five capabilities because I struggled with it for many, many years—to make truly meaningful connections with people who report to me, people I report to, my colleagues at work, my clients. What I’ve seen through my recent research with leaders who happen to be Black or Latinx is that the system fails to make connections with many, many people. And without those connections, it’s practically impossible to succeed.', 'Diane Brady: Because they’re the only?', 'Joanna Barsh: Because they’re not helped. We’re all helped, even Benjamin Franklin, who says, “Gee, I’m a self-made man.” His sister helped him, his parents helped him, all his friends helped him. He did not make it on his own.', 'Diane Brady: The words self-made man, yes, never quite accurate. Everybody needs help.', 'Joanna Barsh: And connection. Think about all of the people in your work life and in your personal life who are truly helping you in some way, even small. Today, I’ve broken every piece of electronics that I own. It’s very hard to do business without your PC, without a phone that works, et cetera. There are dozens of people at McKinsey who I don’t know who are helping me. Yes, it’s their job, but they don’t have to help me. They could go help somebody else in the hierarchy of who really matters in this world. But they’re helping me, and I’m grateful for it. And it makes me feel good to know that I’m being this supported. So that’s what I mean by centered leadership practice.', 'Diane Brady: For somebody who travels around the world at almost a breakneck pace, home time might feel good. I’ve seen it with celebrities—not to put you in the same camp as, say, the Kardashians.', 'Joanna Barsh: That’s a very funny thought.', 'Diane Brady: Whereas, for someone like me, who perhaps is emblematic of the broader population, it feels isolating. Joanna Barsh: It’s hard.', 'Diane Brady: For people who do want to take on bigger leadership roles, it seems in some ways more difficult to do it from your living room, certainly when you’ve got kids, dogs, and everything else running about. What advice do you give to that group, myself included?', 'Joanna Barsh: There’s this notion that things don’t need to be at the extremes. When you are this constrained situationally, be 5 percent braver in taking risk. You don’t have to be 150 percent braver. Any movement is good because you’ll be learning and growing.', 'When you are this constrained situationally, be 5 percent braver in taking risk. You don’t have to be 150 percent braver.', 'If you’ve gotten to a point where you know you’ve stopped learning, you’re in protection mode, which means that you’re afraid. The most important thing to do is to shift out of that into feeling safe and feeling that you have room to grow. How do you do that? This is really tough advice. You welcome fear.', 'I lived with fear for most of my life, mostly self-imposed. It’s not that I grew up in circumstances where you would say, “Yes, I totally get it, Joanna.” It was all inside my head. Part of centered leadership is calming yourself to get curious about your own fear. How does it serve you, and how does it limit you? When you can see it in that way—that it was trying to help you, but it’s served its time, and it’s now limiting you—then you have the power to be able to move past it.', 'That’s what you need to do, or anyone needs to do, who says, “I feel isolated, I feel stuck, I feel like I could be doing more, I should be growing, I should be rising, I should be accomplishing.” We are in a very weird time right now. If you’re not accomplishing as much as your life plan on paper says you should, maybe it’s time to put the life plan on the shelf for now and figure out how to have a better time every day.', 'Begin to explore other parts of yourself and grow in other ways as well. For leaders, this is a very important time to learn how to listen.', 'There is always a silver lining in any tragedy. I love this guy, David Kessler, who’s a grief counselor. What he says is, “Recognize that you are in the middle of loss, somebody you love has passed away, the life you loved is no longer, and you’ll probably never get it back.”', 'There are a lot of things to feel grief about. What David writes and says is, “There will be meaning. When you’re ready, you’ll find meaning in the loss. The meaning will take a completely different shape than what you expect it to, but it’s there to be found.” That makes things better. For someone to die senselessly, you can’t find meaning in that. But to carry the spirit of that person on in the actions that you take, well, there’s meaning in that.', 'Diane Brady: You’ve talked a lot about the individual-leader perspective, but is this reshaping business?', 'Joanna Barsh: We’re in a time of extraordinary change, and that changes risk–reward a lot. As companies face new stark realities, creativity and innovation are needed at an all-time high. You see companies doing things that are extraordinary. You see human beings coming together to do extraordinary things.', 'I’m on a public board of a company that got hit because it’s a retailer. When you don’t have stores open, you can’t sell a lot of stuff unless you really invested in e-commerce. Their e-commerce sales went through the roof. It allowed them to see possibilities that they had not seen before. That’s a silver lining. Does it change the brutish reality of store closures? No. But it opens up a new avenue of opportunity. There are lots of other things that will come to a company as a result of suddenly not being able to do business in the old way.', 'I think that another element, which has its pluses and minuses, is that the population has a louder voice and is using it. The population is outside your door; they’re your employees. They’re also your consumers. They are thinking through things themselves and behaving in new ways. It behooves the company to figure out how to adapt. The guys who do it faster are going to reap some reward from that. I see it in the public marketplace, and I see it from the companies that I’ve been talking to. A wonderful example would be, are you really providing the entertainment that your consumers want to watch and digest?', 'A lot of entertainment companies, a lot of news companies that were really not diverse at top levels, suddenly got religion and said, “Hey, we have to serve up what people want. For us to know that, we need to have far greater diversity in our ranks. Let’s get that done now. Why wait?” The worst thing to do is to cling to the old. Those companies that cling to old ways are going to lose out in the end, and they should lose out, if you think about it.', 'Diane Brady: Very true. I think the term I used was nasty, brutish, and short, which I cribbed from Hobbes in philosophy class. All of which, Joanna, you are not.', 'Joanna Barsh: That’s what life is, so that’s that!', 'Joanna Barsh: You know, I think that energizing gets short shrift. I watched that, by the way, from 2004 to 2015. In centered leadership, energizing is one of the five capabilities. People have let it go. It was a badge of courage for you to be an executive who didn’t sleep, who was on planes all the time, who worked to the point of burnout.', 'But, Zoom can burn us out. You’ve got to be careful that what was good and true before may not be good and true now, just like flexibility. We were all looking forward to working from home. Now that we’ve worked from home all the time, we’re all heading to burnout. Get outside, get up, move around every hour, jump up and down, be silly.', 'Do something to get your energy back. There are four great ways to get it back. One is physical, and that’s the one we all know about. But think about emotional energy. When you feel isolated, you have to reach out to some people. Think about mental energy. When you’re stuck doing one kind of thing all day long, you’ve got to learn something else that’s interesting to you. And also think about spiritual energy, which I do think about a lot. I get that from being in nature and from appreciating beauty. I don’t know where you’ll get it from. We’re all different, and we need energy.', 'Diane Brady: Great advice for now and also for later, of course. Thank you very much for joining us, Joanna.', 'Joanna Barsh: Are we out of time already? I have so much I want to tell you!', 'Diane Brady: Well, save it for another show. And for those of you who want to hear more and read more, you can go and buy the book.

Organizations that plan  for the postpandemic world are better able to deliver value—even amid uncertainty.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Chris Gagnon and Elizabeth Mygatt talk about what it takes for companies to be “future ready” in the world after the COVID-19 pandemic. An edited version of the conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. While the future may be looking somewhat brighter as we emerge from the pandemic, it doesn’t look a lot more predictable. So how does an organization prepare for that? How do we plan and organize for that? Joining me to discuss this are Chris Gagnon, a senior partner in Austin who leads McKinsey’s global Organization Practice and Elizabeth Mygatt, an associate partner in Boston who advises companies across multiple sectors on organizational transformation. Welcome, Chris. Hi, Liz.', 'Chris Gagnon: Hi, Diane. It’s great to be here.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: Hi, Diane. Happy to be here today.', 'Diane Brady: Chris, when we talk about organizing for the future, which is a subject you’ve both been looking at quite a bit lately, can you tell me a little more about what we mean by that?', 'Chris Gagnon: Sure, I’d love to. And to do it, we’ll take a little spin back in history. The most important thing McKinsey’s ever written on organization was the 7-S framework. The article that first introduced the 7-S framework to the world was called “Structure is not organization.” It had a wonderful image of the Magritte painting of a pipe that said, “This is not a pipe.”', 'The point that Tom Peters and Bob Waterman [the article’s authors] were making was that an org chart is a very, very incomplete description of how an organization works. An organization is a system. They had, at the time, seven things that each started with an S, and that remains a useful way to describe organizations.', 'But a lot has changed since the 1970s. We’re seeing increasing experimentation and boldness in organizational models across the elements of the system. So we decided to take a new look at what are the elements of a system beyond its structure today.', 'Diane Brady: So Liz, when I think about the future, so much of what we write these days is cast in a prepandemic, postpandemic fashion. How much of your research is related to COVID-19 versus just the way the world’s going?', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: A lot of this research we began well before COVID-19. But what we have seen is that COVID-19 has accelerated changes that were already under way. So for example, people were already seeking greater flexibility in their work. Automation and new technologies were already changing the way we worked and the skills we needed. We were stressed and overwhelmed to start with. And we were already experiencing meaningfully different shifts in millennials and Gen Zers. What we’re seeing is four macrotrends that really inform how organizations have to evolve differently. They’re around increasing connectivity, which is really undermining traditional power structures.', 'Certainly, COVID-19 forced a 100 percent operating-model environment and proved that remote- and hybrid-operating models could increase productivity—and indeed, could work better than anyone had ever anticipated. Meanwhile, you have lower transaction costs enabling people to collaborate better outside large organizations than within them, as well as unprecedented automation. In fact, COVID-19 really demonstrated that every business can now be a technology business, right? And then finally, we saw societal-expectation shifts, where the role of business in society is changing as a new generation rises. In fact, that new generation is also changing it. They’re expecting to be promoted more quickly to find purpose and meaning in their work, are willing to vote with their feet and shift organizations.', 'All of these things were evolving before the pandemic hit and were changing and informing how organizations had to respond. COVID-19 has accelerated and reinforced many of those.', 'Chris Gagnon: We’re fortunate: we get to talk to organizations all over the world. This may be a slight exaggeration, but let me say, nobody really loves their operating model. People use different words. They describe it as too bureaucratic or too slow or too siloed. But it’s hard to change. Inertia’s an enormous force here.', 'While the pandemic accelerated experimentation, the underlying dynamic before COVID-19 is the important one; 30 years ago, if you looked around for bold org experiments, self-organizing teams, or open-book management, or whatever it is, you saw them in small companies. Today, you find them more often in the biggest winners in the world: the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Netflixes, the Bridgewater Associates, the Haiers.', 'And it’s really important to remember that we’re in a winner-take-all world. It used to be that being kind of an average or above-average performer in most industries meant you got to make good money. Today, all the returns accrue to the top 20 percent or so of companies. So if that’s what the top 20 percent of companies are doing—if they’re inventing a better way—and you want to be in that winners’ group, this is the question that’s got to be tackled.', 'It used to be that being kind of an average or above-average performer in most industries meant you got to make good money.', 'Diane Brady: When you talk about that winner-take-all society that we’re in right now, so much of it is anchored in technology and the advantages that they might have on data and with regard to AI. That’s only one of the aspects you look at in terms of organizing for the future. Can you give me some sense as to what’s important? If I’m a company that isn’t Amazon or Google, can I even compete in this environment now?', 'Chris Gagnon: Of course you can. Listen, every company has to include technology. Technology is there to enable people. But I’ll tell you, what’s really important is people. An organization is designed to organize people and their work and their efforts. Almost all the things that we discuss as keys or imperatives can be enabled by technology, but they’re designed to help people perform. At the heart of this thinking is humanism, not just technology.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: As we get into the imperatives, you’ll see most of them are about people: who we are, how we show up, how we see ourselves as part of a larger organization, how we collaborate. How we make decisions, how we show up as talent, and how we use the talent we have.', 'What we’re seeing is that the organizations that get this right are really experimenting and innovating boldly in how they set up people to be successful and to feel successful and empowered in their work and as part of the broader purpose. But then, in parallel, how do you think about technology and automation facilitating that and amplifying it?', 'So it’s very much two sides of the same coin. And we certainly see many technology companies doing very, very well. But part of why they’re doing well is because of the way they are deploying and organizing and delighting and inspiring the people in their organizations.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s get into what we can learn from some of these successful companies, whether they’re next-generation companies or companies that have just pivoted in this environment. The first imperative is one that I have heard a lot about—which seems logical but difficult to do—which is to take a stance on purpose. Who does that well and why?', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: I might actually pull us back one minute before we dive into purpose because we actually thought about the imperatives in three buckets or categories.', 'Diane Brady: Sure. Let’s do that.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: I think about addressing the first three as identity imperatives. Purpose is certainly at the core of that. It guides our decisions from the board room to the front line. We see over 80 percent of employees reporting it as important to have a purpose, but less than half report their company’s purpose actually driving impact. So the essence of why we exist is really, really important. Increasingly, we’re seeing that organizations need to take a resonant stance on purpose.', 'In addition to the why is a bit of the what and the how. When we think about how is value created, how is an organization’s mission advanced? Really get clear on how you set up your organization around the stuff you need to be really good at in a differentiated way so that your focused value agenda mobilizes resources to focus on matters with the capabilities and the talent required to actually be successful and outperform the competition. Value—and getting clear on your value agenda—is also a really key piece of this.', 'And then, finally, culture. How do you run the place? What is the secret sauce? Every organization has a culture. What we are seeing is that many of the leading organizations have a culture that’s distinctly different. It’s not for everyone. But it has distinctive elements that are going to draw the kind of talent and capabilities they need to advance what they’re trying to do.', 'Chris Gagnon: On the subject of purpose, we heard very different things from leaders. There are some leaders who believe that they have a personal, social mission, and it becomes that of the organization. It’s really parallel to shareholder value. That’s actually a pretty small group. There’s another group, though, that says, “Boy, if all we stand for is creating shareholder value, we won’t get our fair share of talent.” We need to be more explicit about what our objective functions are across those.', 'I find value, personally, one of the most fascinating things here. One of the great mysteries of the past 50 years has been the success of private equity. In fact, private equity regularly buys and sells companies to and from the public markets and outperforms with them. You try to figure out why. All the rationales break down. They don’t necessarily invest more. They don’t necessarily get executives with better resumes. The only thing that holds up is they are crystal clear about their value-creation plan.', 'I don’t want to say something as high minded as “strategy.” I want to be mathematical. For example, “We bought a company for $2 billion. We’re going to make it worth $5 billion. And here’s where the $3 billion is going to come from.” And it’s a list of things, ten or 12 long, that human beings can understand. And boy, if you want human beings to perform, one of the best things you can do is be clear with them about what you’re trying to accomplish. And then they can fill in how they do their jobs to make that happen in the best way.', 'Diane Brady: Are the best companies evolving on some front with regard to purpose, value, and culture?', 'Chris Gagnon: This is about conscious aspiration. Look at the Amazon leadership model. It does not look like something that’s posted on the wall of a traditional corporation. Look at the wonderful document that many, many people will have seen online about Netflix’s culture and how they try to treat each other. Read Ray Dalio’s book about principles.', 'Now, you can agree or disagree with any of those. In fact, I would argue they’re not worth much unless you could agree or disagree violently with them. But those are people having real conscious decisions about who they want to be and how they want to act. And just like in our individual lives, I would submit that’s a really good thing to do.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: I would probably go one step further. It’s not enough to make it feel good. But if, in fact, it doesn’t inform decisions—and hard decisions at an organizational level—it’s probably not a strong enough purpose, and people are going to walk away because it’s not going to resonate for them.', 'So as one example, think about predictable dilemmas or hard trade-offs that organizations need to make and moments when that purpose can inform it. So for example, CVS. They exited the tobacco business because they are a health company. The tobacco business is a big business, right? They had to say no to a pretty meaningful stream of revenue and business and consumers there. But it was not con\\xadsistent with their purpose. It wasn’t consistent with their identity. So they made a decision, right? People look at that and they say, “OK. I actually know that CVS is literally putting its money where its mouth is.”', 'So examples like that, not only is it about identity, not only is it about an individual feeling like their own purpose is resonant with that of the organization’s, but we actually see the company walking the walk and making hard decisions informed by and guided by the purpose.', 'Diane Brady: One of the things that’s always fascinated me is culture. Every CEO talks about culture and the importance of it. Yet it is so hard to measure and not really something that can be a top-down initiative. What do you see the top quartile of companies or cultures doing differently?', 'Chris Gagnon: Wow. I’m going to answer that by disagreeing with almost everything you just said in the question. This is going to be fun. Let me tell a story, though, to lead into it. I do something with audiences all the time, which is to put up a slide with some of the best and most well-known business books of the last ten years. So Good to Great’s up there, and The Toyota Way and Execution by Larry Bossidy. And I ask the audience, “Who’s right? What do we think good management is?” Because those seem like interesting questions, right?', 'Diane Brady: What do they say?', 'Chris Gagnon: Interestingly, they say lots of things. Sometimes we say there are no right or wrong answers. Here there are actually right or wrong answers. We’ve been measuring cultures with the Organizational Health Index [OHI] for 15 years now. And we know that the companies that score in the top quartile of OHI have two-and-a-half or three times the performance of those in the median. Furthermore, what we know is that to score in the top quartile, you have to have a culture that stands for something. So what doesn’t work is reading a little bit of every one of those books and putting them together, which is what so many companies do.', 'They have executives pass through. They’ve read books. They’ve started initiatives. They’ve probably been influenced by consultants. You have a management system, which is mush. The best companies have a distinct philosophy. At Toyota, the Toyota way is around continuous improvement. That’s not the way Apple runs themselves, right? They’re in really competing markets. Apple’s a market shaper. They think about innovation and market data. The way those two companies spend their time is completely different.', 'The success of hallmark cultures is that they read one of these groups of books that hung together with a consistent philosophy, and they really, really stuck with it. A little bit of best practice here, a little bit of best practice there will get you killed.', 'Diane Brady: So it is the personality basically set from the top?', 'Chris Gagnon: Yeah. I think this is measurable. And if not set from the top, it certainly can be led from the top. People need to get it in the core of who they are. That’s why we’ll talk about talent assessment being so important. It’s not enough to have good people. It’s not enough to just have many people who fit. But if I were to lay out the requirements for a great leader, having a clear cultural aspiration and a plan to drive it through the organization would be really near the top of my list.', 'Diane Brady: Liz, do you want to add to that?', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: I would love to add to the concept of “mush” because it’s a good one—or maybe a bad one. So you think about what makes a culture compelling: a couple of distinctive, different, noticeable practices.', 'McKinsey’s a great example, right? McKinsey’s culture isn’t for everyone. But for the people who are here and who stay here, there are a bunch of very consistent cultural practices that work and that make it work for teams to come together having never met each other and be jelling within a day.', 'Similarly, if you think about Bridgewater, they’re very known for radical transparency. You put people in the middle of a circle, and you have super transparent performance reviews. This would make many people’s skin crawl, right? But for the people who are there, they learn from it. They thrive on it. It’s a key piece of what allows them to do their business well.', 'Amazon’s got these leadership principles that I see many others sort of adopting from, whether it’s customer obsession, whether it’s having a backbone, whether it’s disagreeing and committing. Disagree and commit, for example, is something that I have a couple of clients who have absorbed for themselves. Because it’s really distinctive. A simple practice like that really changes how the business functions. It changes how decisions get made. It changes how the place gets run.', 'None of these things are mush. They are sharp practices. People notice them. They also allow you to get the talent you need because top talent likely isn’t going to go to a place with a middle-of-the-road culture that doesn’t really stand for anything and isn’t exciting.', 'Diane Brady: It’s fascinating. One of the challenges with culture or values has been the sense that it hasn’t been inclusive, for example, of all stakeholders. Cultural fit can sometimes be shorthand for “people like me.”', 'When we think about the importance of diversity, inclusion, broader stakeholders within a culture, can you accommodate that? The cultures you talk about, for example, are very distinct cultures. How do we kind of move to where the world’s going, which is we basically have to answer to more masters? Chris?', 'Chris Gagnon: Yeah. I would argue that we not only can but that we have to. Let me tell you why. The first argument for diversity and equity and inclusion is just the human argument. It is the right thing to do. Sometimes I feel like that should be enough. If we don’t stand for being fair to human beings, I don’t know what to stand for.', 'But let me proceed to the case, which is, cultures that are cohesive in the way you described—we all look alike, we all think alike, we all have the same accent—do better, actually, in certain circumstances. They do better as long as the world is really stable and the challenge is very stable. That’s not the case for almost any company in the world. So to manage change, you need diversity of perspective and style.', 'Now that diversity of perspective and style has to all fit within a management system. And people will select those. I don’t think the way they select them will sort out on race, creed, color, gender, or sexual preference. Some people will fit at Bridgewater, and some people will fit at Amazon, and some people won’t. But that’s a selection process about human beings, not about surface characteristics.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: Let me share one more thought on the diversity piece. There are lots of good arguments for just how much talent is lost when you don’t take a full-spectrum perspective. But there’s also research around how diversity can actually really enhance decision making—internal decisions, external decisions.', 'There are lots of good arguments for just how much talent is lost when you don’t take a full-spectrum perspective. But there’s also research around how diversity can actually really enhance decision making.', 'Diane Brady: What does it mean to be radically flat? That is also one of the imperatives, which I know gets into more of the kind of operational aspects of being future ready. Talk a bit about that.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: On the structure piece, this is one that we actually struggled with. We saw so many different examples of how organizations were behaving.', 'On the one hand, and we see this quite a bit with COVID-19, you have organizations dissolving into networks of teams or agile teams. As COVID-19 unfolded, instead of people doing their normal day job, they would show up in a morning huddle and figure out what was the job to be done that day or that week. You figured out who needed to be deployed against it. Those people went off and focused on that. When they were done, they came back. You have teams of teams with the right resources. And you have a fair bit of fluidity in the organizational structure and much more focus on the mission and the outcomes.', 'On the other end, we also see organizations radically getting flatter. Instead of having typical spans of five to eight to ten to 12, you see spans as big as 30 and even higher because of how organizations are reconceiving management.', 'Diane Brady: For those who don’t know, can you define what we mean by “spans”?', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: In a typical organization, you might have a manager who has five direct reports or eight direct reports. Or if she’s managing a customer-service center, she might have ten, 15, 20 direct reports on her team. You might see similar spans in nursing units, for example. Rarely, though, did we see spans of larger than 15 or so because there are human limits as to how much time you can actually spend helping teams figure out what they need to be doing. Now we see, in a number of agile organizations, there’s spans of up to 50. People are just very clear on what they need to do, and they go and do it.', 'When you think about how an organization is set up, an executive might reach reflexively for an org chart. But that doesn’t actually describe what people are doing. More and more, as project work becomes more important, there are a whole bunch of other dynamics that actually describe the work people are doing and how they’re spending their time. So what we’re seeing is many other mechanisms, like decision making, like having a clear value agenda, like culture, that are really informing how work is happening. Hierarchy takes a back seat. It doesn’t disappear. Humans like hierarchy. But it does become less of the command-and-control, top-down, simple way we draw the organization.', 'Diane Brady: I’ve heard “helix organization,” “matrix.” Those are terms I’ve certainly heard and seen around McKinsey. Is that best in practice?', 'Chris Gagnon: McKinsey actually helped a lot of clients invent the matrix. It was enormously powerful for a long time because it let you operate on more than one business-unit dimension at once. Today, even two’s not enough. So I’ve got bad news for anybody listening to this podcast. You are stuck with business units, functions, geographies, customer segments, and initiatives. There’s no structural way out of it. There is no magic, right answer. You pick the ones you want to emphasize at any moment in time. You try to do that with some sense. But you’re still stuck managing across all those dimensions. The world dictates it.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: If we take the human lens, it is very hard for anyone to conceive of more than about three dimensions. So if you think about four, five, six dimensions, all of a sudden, you are really stuck in a pickle because it’s very hard to figure out what to do and who to answer to.', 'Diane Brady: We shut down.', 'Chris Gagnon: Yeah. So what do we need? We need ways for people to deploy flexibly in team-based ways to tackle things. We need ways to make decisions. And on the balance of making decisions with super accuracy or speed, I’ll tell you, the balance is moving toward speed and then getting the right people involved.', 'Structurally though, to Liz’s point, we had a huge set of learnings during COVID-19. One of the reasons we had managers was to manage people. We assumed if we didn’t manage them, they wouldn’t work very hard. Then we went to the COVID-19 world. And if anybody knows anyone who hasn’t worked very hard for the past year, please send them to me. Because we’ve been looking for them, and we haven’t found them. We don’t know a single company where they would say, “Boy, we let our people work remotely, and they all goofed off.” So managing people to keep them working hard is a really bad justification. But because of it, we trapped lots of great people in middle management.', 'We brought you into companies. If you did well, we promoted you to management. And management—I’m going to be a little flip here—often turned into preparing reports to go into the recommendations to the steering committee for the spreadsheet before the orderly budget update, right? Nobody really wants to spend their time that way. But COVID-19 happened, and we all moved to a Zoom world.', 'I don’t know about you, but most of the folks I talk to can see either nine or 12 or 16 people on a screen, and that’s all that really need to be in the meeting. If you’re looking at nine people there, who should be there? How about the people who are doing the work and know what’s going on and the people who can make big decisions? So the world really took a lot of people who were stuck in very staff-like positions and moved them into being doers or deciders. And the world got better, and everybody got happier.', 'Diane Brady: What is the role of talent right now? And how do people manage it to be ready for this very unpredictable future, COVID-19 or not?', 'It used to be that you could get  the talent you needed, but financial support was hard to come by. Now it’s largely reversed.’', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: Your word “unpredictable” is really important, and it can actually govern a lot of this. As we thought about talent, the big theme here was recognizing that talent is, in fact, a scarcer capital than financial capital. It used to be that you could get the talent you needed, but financial support was hard to come by. Now it’s largely reversed. For most organizations you talk to, what’s top of their list? What keeps them up at night? It’s the question, “Do we have the talent to deliver on our strategy, to meet our customers’ needs?”', 'So as we think about unpredictability, there are a few pieces. One, as you get clear on your value agenda, how do you get the right talent in the roles that matter and drive disproportionate value? How do you get that right today? Then how do you get it right in two months or six months or a year? So the dynamism of it is really important. This mapping of talent to value, which is something we talk about quite a bit beyond this, is a really key piece. How do you get the right folks in the right roles at the right time that really, really matter? And then how are you able to move it around? That’s one piece.', 'A second piece is, how do you develop signature employee experiences and make sure that the experience itself is building, developing, retaining, delighting your people because this is something that matters over time, right? We recognize that talent is hard to come by. When you find the talent you need, try and keep them as best you can. Recognizing that employee experience is increasingly important. Organizations have become much savvier at doing that.', 'The third piece here is really getting much sharper around the HR function. How do you build an analytical, data-driven powerhouse that’s really there to deploy your talent, your talent engine, in the ways that matter most to your business? Recognizing that HR and the talent capital is one of your most important assets—for some organizations, it’s your only asset—is really key.', 'Chris Gagnon: This is a revolutionary moment in HR, to Liz’s question. If you talk to CEOs, there are a number of surveys out that say they think HR and talent are their number-one priority. If you ask them about their confidence in their own HR department’s ability to tackle it, it’s really, really low.', 'The reason for that is too many companies think about talent for talent’s sake. “Are we a nice place to work?” is the starting question. When I meet a new client, my test for this is always to ask when talent gets discussed in the executive committee or board meeting. If the answer is “at the end of the meeting, if there’s time,” you know you’re stuck in this hole. But when you connect talent to that value agenda, magical things happen.', 'The HR staff becomes the equivalent of the finance staff, except they really do control the most important asset: the human talent to get things done. They get much more demanding about having the right person in the right role, not just at the executive team, but I can’t tell you how often the key roles that are controlling value are n minus two, three, four in the organization. The difference between having the right person and the wrong person can be hundreds of millions of dollars of value.', 'When you get the right people in, there’s where magic really happens because those people won’t put up with whatever’s dysfunctional in your organi\\xadzation. If the processes are too slow, if decision authorities aren’t right, if the culture isn’t aligned, you’re going to hear from those performers trying to drive performance. If you get the value agenda and the talent thing right, it sort of forces you to resolve a bunch of other issues.', 'Diane Brady: It gets into how we grow. I remember a CEO many years ago telling me, “Diane, the future company could be a CEO and, let’s say, a CFO. And everyone else, they don’t need to own, because they’ll be part of an ecosystem.” I’m intrigued by how talent plays into what you also write about with regard to ecosystems as a driver of growth going forward. When we talk about talent, do we need to own them, or is it about having them in our orbit? Liz?', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: Having them in your orbit is often enough, right? You think about the rise of the gig economy. And certainly, this has been impacted by COVID-19. But many, many people were choosing to work gig jobs because of the increased flexibility and freedom it afforded.', 'Organizations like Apple don’t do their own manufacturing: iPhones are huge, I have one right next to me, but they don’t actually own that. They work with partners to do that. Owning the resources in a world where transaction costs are falling is actually no longer as important. Being able to play well with others in the sandbox and really build privileged partnerships, really learn how to navigate and manage the ecosystem, becomes increasingly important.', 'COVID-19 is a great example of showing how companies were coming together in the ecosystem. So beyond just gig economies or privileged partnerships in the supply chain and broader in the ecosystem, you had public–private partnerships coming together around vaccine manufacturing and distribution. You had healthcare organizations and auto plants coming together to increase the produc\\xadtivity or the production of ventilators early on. Just thinking about the lowering boundaries and the importance of being able to blur boundaries really came into focus during COVID-19. But it has massive implications for talent and partner\\xadships as well.', 'Chris Gagnon: I love that, Liz. Some of the most fascinating experiments we’re seeing are in this area for two reasons. One is the bigger an organization you have, the harder it is to organize it and make its culture special, right? The more complexities you’re trying to fit in, the more people, the more variants you’ve got. If you can keep your organization small, focused, and elite, the chance that your secret sauce is going to have some magic goes up. But second, there’s a great organizing principle that some companies are taking advantage of, which is: markets work.', 'A fascinating company to look at is Haier, the white-goods company in China. Zappos has also done something similar around disaggregating their organization into almost small subcompanies that work together contracting but treat each other more like customers, suppliers, and partners who have to find a way to work together because they’re trying to perform, than corporate citizens who have to somehow play according to some rule book. There’s a lot that getting that kind of market tension in between units can really help. So we’re going to see more and more experi\\xadmentation around disintegration of the talent base and leverage of the ecosystem.', 'Diane Brady: Right. We’ve been talking about ecosystems for years. So it is interesting to think it’s more about the evolution of the ecosystem now, isn’t it? What is it that we’ve learned that has not worked?', 'Chris Gagnon: Let me start with one. We talked earlier about the decline in importance of hierarchy in managing work and teams. That is not to say that hierarchy isn’t required. Hierarchy is absolutely a functional part of organizations. It’s how a direction gets set. It’s how the most important decisions get made. So one thing that’s failed is kind of new age self-organization, “We’ll all just figure this out together.” I don’t know of a single company that I consider wildly successful and deeply empowering of its employees that doesn’t have strong leadership.', 'Diane Brady: So let me ask about data. We’ve talked a lot in the org practice—and beyond, about AI, the future of work. That is obviously a big factor in how companies grow. This seems like the winner-take-all category here. She who has the best platform wins. Liz, I’m sure it’s more than that.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: I think it is more than that. There’s an ecosystem element here. Certainly, some of the big tech players have been enormously successful, which is part of why they’re doing well, right? But another thing we see is that organizations are looking beyond the confines of their organization to think through the data they need.', 'Think about healthcare organizations that are thinking about data they have internally and data they have access to in the broader ecosystem. How do you amass the data you need, whether or not you own it, to help inform the decisions you make and the moves you make, the strategy you take? Two, how do you streamline your business processes, as we were talking about earlier: having technology and platforms underpin and help the people in an organization move in sort of an elegant, coordinated way?', 'Many of the challenges we see organizations facing are around processes that don’t work, that don’t talk to each other; data sets that don’t work, don’t talk to each other; people that don’t work, don’t talk to each other. So how do we use platforms and technology and people to get better at having different parts of the organization really talk to each other, inform each other, build insights together?', 'Chris Gagnon: I’ll give you a couple of examples there. The winners are clearly thinking about what information they want to own. And they assign value to it in advance of when they can commercialize it. And they do that by imagining customer value. I teased one client who I was close with. And I said, “If our business was running Amazon, we’d have a committee debating book recommendations,” right?', 'Diane Brady: Try Harry Potter. It sells.', 'Chris Gagnon: Exactly right. But second is bringing a data-centric mind. I’ll give you the first place I would start, which is in human-talent decisions. Why do I say that? There are so many shout-outs we should give during this, but a huge one goes to Daniel Kahneman. If anybody listening to the podcast hasn’t read Thinking Fast and Slow, you should.', 'We’ve known for a long time that interviewing people is a terrible way to make hiring decisions. It’s not very accurate. It’s subject to all the biases we were concerned about earlier. One of our good friends and champions of the world, Sandy Ogg, says, “We spend all this money trying to decide on investment decisions. And then when it comes time to talk about the people who run the asset, we talk to them for 45 minutes and say, ‘You know what? Seemed like a good guy.’”', 'Diane Brady: “You remind me of me at 23.”', 'Chris Gagnon: Exactly. It’s more often a “good guy” than a “good gal” when you do it that way, right? Making hiring decisions with data is a great place to start. We’re so much better off today using forensic, due-diligence, big data, and online-assessment tools. And you see that in the hiring processes of, I would guess, 90 percent of the companies we looked at and admire.', 'Making hiring decisions with data is a great place to start. We’re so much better off today using forensic, due-diligence, big data, and online-assessment tools.', 'Diane Brady: This last one fascinates me: learning. My first reaction is, “I’m from HR, and I’m here to help.” We are rethinking what it means to learn because it has a bit of a bad rep sometimes within companies. Can you talk a bit about that, Liz?', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: When we think about learning, why does it matter, right? It isn’t because people spend a little bit of time each year in classes and coursework and checking boxes. It’s because so many of the jobs that will exist in 2030 literally don’t exist yet. The educational institutions around us aren’t necessarily fully geared up to deliver those skills.', 'So a key piece of this is really understanding: What are the skills, and therefore skill gaps, that we’re going to need to deliver on our strategy? And then, how do we set it up internally, or sometimes externally, to make sure that we have those skills and capabilities in our talent pool when we need them?', 'It’s an ever-moving target. It’s not just about knowing the skills you’re going to need and being able to cultivate them. It’s also actually being able to learn to learn as leaders, as individuals, and as organizations because the world is moving so, so fast that if you are really good at what you do right now but you can’t become good at something new, you’re likely going to get stuck.', 'Diane Brady: Hiring for potential: What advice do you have?', 'Chris Gagnon: I would personally take away a couple of things from our research. The first is that structuring any organization is a design challenge. It is a challenge of imagination, of aspiration, and of coherence. So thinking about the organization as a system—and spending time designing it—is a worthwhile exercise for the leadership team.', 'If I said, “I can’t do everything at once, but I want to start making traction, and I want to move as fast as I can,” I would center on a couple of plays. One is, I would think about the value agenda as though a private-equity firm had just bought my company. What would we be working on if we were trying to triple our value in five years? Answering that question in a really finite way, with dollar values next to ideas and initiatives, is a really good thing to do.', 'The second thing I would do is, I would get the best talent I can possibly put my hands on next to every one of those initiatives. Because if I get great people against the right initiatives, as we said earlier, they’ll force us to sort out a lot of the inelegances that are in any organization system.', 'Last, I’d have a bias for speed. I would wire my company to make decisions faster unless there was a really good way not to. We all err on the side of too much staff work, too slow. It’s very hard to make the error the other way. If you haven’t read Jeff Bezos’s annual letter that talks about this, it is one of the few must-read pieces of the last decade. So that would be my third.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: It’s not just the Amazons of the world that are doing this. When we looked at 30 US companies across the ten industries that own the most economic profit, they were doing many of the things that Chris said. But it wasn’t only those things. The thing we see, and the thing I’d encourage organizations to do, is to pick a couple of areas where you want to go big and go be bold there. Innovate, experiment, see what works, and scale the stuff that does because that is one of the ways you get crisp on what you’re trying to do, who you are, how you show up, how you organize. It also is ultimately what’s going to allow you to build that distinctive culture, that distinctive way of organizing, that’s going to ultimately be helpful in the long run.', 'Chris Gagnon: Liz, I love that one. I want to share two stories from the COVID-19 world that have continued to inspire me. One was a company that had a plan, and this is not a technology company. They had a plan to go to curbside delivery. Their project plan was an 18-month plan to get through the pilot. When COVID-19 hit, they went live in two weeks. The CEO looked at me and said, “I don’t know if 18 months was the right plan. And I don’t know if two weeks is right. But how do I think about all the other projects that are going too slow in our company?”', 'The second was a meeting with a mining company, about as low technology a business as you can get, digging stuff out of the ground. They showed me a chart that showed plant productivity relative to the amount of supervision they could get back to work. And there was a straight trend line. And I said, “That’s not very interesting.” And they said, “That’s because you can’t read very well, Chris. We inverted the scale. The less supervision we had come back, the higher productivity was. What do we do about that?”', 'Now listen, these were special times. There are a lot of heroics that have been going on. But we’ve all got to realize that the dynamics of running companies in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s aren’t the dynamics today. There’s a lot more risk from sitting still, doing things the old way, than there is from doing what Liz says and trying your own experiments to be bold in some new ways.', 'Diane Brady: The words that come to mind for me are “disrupt or be disrupted”; I guess that would be one of the big takeaways here. And a fascinating piece. So Chris Gagnon, Liz Mygatt, thank you very much for joining us.', 'Chris Gagnon: Thank you.', 'Elizabeth Mygatt: Thanks, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: And thanks to you, the listener. I hope that you do check out their piece on the future-ready company on McKinsey.com. In addition to the articles, there are some really terrific graphics that really bring this to life.

26,The search for purpose at work,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-search-for-purpose-at-work,"Purpose is personal, but companies play a critical role in how we express it.","['Purpose is personal, but companies play a critical role in how we express it.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Naina Dhingra and Bill Schaninger talk about their surprising discoveries about the role of work in giving people a sense of purpose. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. In this episode, we’re talking about fascinating new research on individual purpose, the impact that it has on companies, and the impact that your company has on your own sense of purpose. Joining me are two colleagues—first, Naina Dhingra, a partner in the New York office. Hi, Naina.', 'Naina Dhingra: Hi, Diane. Happy to be here.', 'Diane Brady: Great. And Bill Schaninger, a senior partner in McKinsey’s Philadelphia office. Hi, Bill.', 'Bill Schaninger: Hi, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: So let’s start, Naina, with you. Purpose is a term that is tossed around quite a bit. Define it in this context. What’s individual purpose?', 'Naina Dhingra: When we think about this idea of individual purpose, the way we think about it is it’s an overarching sense of what matters in a person’s life. I like to use the term “North Star”—this idea of having a sense of direction, intention, and understanding that the contribution you’re making is going somewhere. Now, that’s a technical definition but I think we all intuitively know what it feels like to be on purpose. It’s when you feel energized and inspired and alive.', 'And it turns out, actually, in some of our research about 85 percent of people feel they have a purpose. But only about 65 percent of them believe they can actually articulate that purpose—which we thought was really interesting.', 'Diane Brady: Bill, it feels almost like an existential problem, our sense of purpose. Can you root it in the context of organizational health?', 'Bill Schaninger: You know, I think one of the things that’s been really challenging during the pandemic was a bifurcation. There were people who were frontline or customer-facing or critical workers, who had to go to work in a time when livelihoods took a back seat to lives. It felt risky.', 'And that really brought front and center the idea of “my primary purpose at this point is I have to work, and I’d like to make it home without getting sick.” But for a significant other portion, people were removed from the workplace while still having to do work.', 'We had this unbelievable smashing together of two worlds: the home world and the work world. I think it’s really brought to the fore “Well, what exactly does work mean to me? What do I have to get out of it? Is it merely a check that facilitates the rest of my life or is it something more purposeful?”—using that word quite explicitly.', 'Can we put a finer point on starting with the person and leaving behind the arrogance that the organization thinks it dictates to people what their purpose is? That is just nonsense. Individuals decide what their purpose is. It’s the organization’s role and opportunity to figure out how to help people bring that purpose to a finer point of what matters to them and to figure out whether or not they can create a role or an experience within the organization that helps meet that. So a big portion of this was, one, starting with the idea that the person was in the prime role and, two, the organization was in a facilitative role, not in front.', 'Diane Brady: Naina, I’d love to unpack purpose a bit more because, to Bill’s point, I often think about it at the corporate level. It is something that usually speaks to higher values or a higher mission. On an individual level, can you give me some examples of how people define their purpose?', 'Naina Dhingra: When we think about employees themselves and how they think about their own sense of purpose, one of the things that we were surprised to find in the research is that about 70 percent of people say they define their purpose through work. And, actually, millennials, even more so, are likely to see their work as their life calling. So what that means is that people are looking for opportunities in the work they do day-to-day to be actually contributing to what they believe their purpose is.', 'One of the things that we were surprised to find in the research is that about 70 percent of people say they define their purpose through work. And, actually, millennials, even more so, are likely to see their work as their life calling.', 'Diane Brady: You know, I hear “life calling” and I can’t help but think that’s a little bit sad. Bill, maybe I’m just biased here. Is work our life calling right now because we don’t have a lot else to do but be on our Zoom calls and work? Is this a good thing?', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, yeah, I’ll tell you, as someone who’s been trapped in a home that was supposed to be a weekend retreat, I’ve basically not left here in 14 months. I can see how we’d land at that idea. Let me take a slightly different take on it. I think what the millennials are saying to us is “Anything I do, I’m going to do with gusto. Time is zero sum. There are only so many hours in the day. If I’m going to do something, it has to work for me. And part of it having to work for me is that it has to work for others.”', 'I think there’s something admirable about that. I’m 51, so I’m a product of the ’80s and, you know, Gordon Gekko, 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             A character in the 1987 film Wall Street, directed by Oliver Stone.\\r               \\r \\r  who was presented to us as a nemesis and ended up becoming a folk hero.', 'Diane Brady: “Greed is good.”', 'Bill Schaninger: Right, exactly—the Michael J. Fox version of Alex P. Keaton, 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             Alex P. Keaton, played by Michael J. Fox, was a character in the TV series Family Ties, which ran from 1982 to 1989.\\r               \\r \\r  right? The archetypal Republican mantra from the ’80s into the ’90s; it just was a different worldview. I think it’s really nice that we have people saying, “Hey, I don’t want to be associated with people who are scumbags or do things that hurt the world. I want to be associated with people who are a force for good.”', 'I love that. And that doesn’t mean it’s naive. It may be uncalibrated. It may be unspecific.', 'I think it’s really nice that we have people saying, “Hey, I don’t want to be associated with people who are scumbags or do things that hurt the world. I want to be associated with people who are a force for good.', 'Certainly, some of the stuff that we found when we were engaging with our newest joiners or our youngest members was, as Naina was saying, the difficulty to put a fine point on what the end state is. So they could say that they know “it” has to be better and “it” has to help others. But they had a difficult time explaining explicitly what “it” is. As people mature—and I don’t mean age but rather just mature in their experiences—as soon as there is another viable claim on their time, attention, and energy, then work can diminish a bit in its importance.', 'But it also gets way clearer the role that work has to play. Work may have an economic contribution, in terms of carrying and providing for the people you love. But you likely also start getting way more specific in terms of where you’d like to put in your time and your effort. That could be education. It could be making people safer. It could be making better roles or jobs for communities. The whole point is, as you get a little further down the line and you start to have other people who need you in terms of your providing care for them, then work goes from diffuse to quite specific pretty quickly.', 'Diane Brady: Naina, one of the things that fascinated me in looking at this study was the fact that parents, for example, place a higher premium on purpose. Can you talk a little bit about the slicing and dicing of the demographics around this?', 'Naina Dhingra: I say this as a millennial with gusto: part of the reason for the research was the debate that Bill and I were having around the role of purpose in one’s life and the role of work in purpose—and whether or not these were two distinct concepts or concepts that were actually quite overlapping, particularly from the perspective of a millennial. The findings about parents we found really interesting, particularly the fact that parents were more than twice as likely to say that they relied on work for purpose. Time is always so scarce. Given the trade-offs that parents are making between work and home, parents are keen to make work time as meaningful as possible. The time that you’re spending away from family really, really needs to matter.', 'In a number of focus groups, parents would say that having a child actually made and helped crystallize their purpose and the impact on the world that they want to have and why it matters. And so, if anything, it’s helped parents actually look at work and what they want out of work—to ask for and seek more meaning in their work. One of the things we are looking at when we look at this choice parents make, often when they consider leaving the firm, is how are we ensuring that people are getting more meaning so that they feel the trade-off is worth it and that they have the ability to fulfill their purpose at work.', 'Diane Brady: You mentioned that you and Bill had been debating prior to doing this study. I’m curious to know where you differed and whether this survey reinforced your beliefs or surprised you in some way. Bill, I’m going to go to you on that one.', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, I think the earliest debate was when I was saying we’re living in something of a gilded cage. It’s really a position of privilege. We work for a preeminent institution. Many of us have extensive academic backgrounds. Basically, these are folks on the far end of a spectrum who work in knowledge roles, so we’re lucky. My push was that there are people who don’t look for purpose through work—that’s not how they view it. It’s a paycheck. And that check is there because they need the transactional exchange, the economic exchange to pay for their obligations, their responsibilities, to take care of other things. There are people who really just want to be skateboarders or really just want to be skiers or sailors. And whatever they do with their gifts, work funds that.', 'Diane Brady: They’re called my children.', 'Bill Schaninger: Yeah, exactly. So I was challenging Naina to say that we should get our heads around the idea that organizational purpose just doesn’t matter that much. For some people, it’s just a check. And we were going back and forth on that. At a minimum, this allowed us to come to the idea that personal purpose, individual purpose, is prime.', 'There’s an amount that people give to work or vocation. Inside that is the space where the organization gets to play, and organizations have to try to maximize that. Through the things they do, they might actually expand the bit given to work or vocation, but they should never assume that bit’s all of it. And then the data, when it came in, gave us a really interesting understanding of how that outside circle—the whole point around individual purpose—just how variable that is.', 'Maybe one of the biggest insights is that you know how a company can help an employee most? Help them figure out what their purpose actually is. Maybe if there was one blinding insight, it was that: how hard a time many—particularly newer—employees have in describing purpose with any kind of specificity.', 'Diane Brady: Well, it is hard. It does feel, Naina, like a personal responsibility. I think of these self-help books about finding your purpose, and it’s all about how you frame your role in the workplace. What’s the responsibility of my employer in giving me purpose?', 'Naina Dhingra: Well, first I think we need the company to actually understand that there is a business case for this. That was actually one of the other things that Bill and I were debating. Bill was like, “I’m a CEO. Why do I care about this stuff? Sounds a bit fluffy—send people into the woods to think about the meaning of life. Why are we going to convince a CEO that they should care about this?”', 'One of the really interesting pieces that we found in the research is that nearly seven out of ten employees are reflecting on their purpose because of COVID-19. Those employees who say that they live their purpose at work are six and a half times more likely to report higher resilience. They’re four times more likely to report better health, six times more likely to want to stay at the company, and one and a half times more likely to go above and beyond to make their company successful.', 'Nearly seven out of ten employees are reflecting on their purpose because of COVID-19. Those employees who say that they live their purpose at work are six and a half times more likely to report higher resilience.', 'So the business case here is that when you help your employees find and live their purpose at work, they’ll do better and are more likely to want to stay, as well as more likely to want to go above and beyond. In fact, we found that as a result of COVID-19, half of American employees are reconsidering the work that they want to do.', 'Diane Brady: Bill, I’m going to ask you about this. Let’s say I am a CEO. I care about my people. So how do I give them a sense of purpose? Is it how I define the job description? I’ve given them all these benefits. I’ve tried to be compassionate. But here’s a survey saying I’m not doing a good job.', 'Bill Schaninger: What they do, though, is they create an opportunity for that person to live their purpose through the portion of their waking hours that’s allocated to work. I’m not trying to play word games or draw a fine line there. I just think agency matters.', 'Individuals have purpose. Organizations don’t give that to a person. The organization as an entity, as a group of people collectively trying to do something, may have a stated, shared purpose. And you’d like to believe that alignment matters there. In fact, a good portion of the research we continue to do is about moving from the attractiveness of individuals seeing the stated purpose of the organization to getting a sense of whether or not that’s real, seeing how they could fit in, and then whether or not they can realize that in their daily activities—and whether or not that firms up a sense of belonging.', 'So organizations can be a conduit. They can make their purpose visible. They can clearly show a link between what they’re asking a person to do and the stated purpose. But the individual alone has agency in deciding what their purpose is and whether or not it aligns with the company’s.', 'Diane Brady: One thing I want to make sure that I’m not mistaking, because I think often we do, is the difference between passion and purpose. Naina, having a passion for what we do seems to be a bit overrated. Is it quite different from feeling a sense of purpose in what we do?', 'Naina Dhingra: That’s an interesting question because this is why, at the start, we were talking about the definition of purpose, since one can have a purpose and have the ability to articulate it. But then there’s also that sense of actually being on purpose. And that sense of truly being on purpose, I would say, often does come when somebody has a real passion for work. When you ask somebody if they feel like they’re doing something in line with their purpose, they might say, “Yeah, it’s because I’m doing something I’m passionate about.”', 'You know, one of the things I’m superpassionate about is working with people who I get to apprentice and help grow. And I have passion for that and I feel alive when I do it. That’s me fulfilling my purpose. And so I think there are a lot of different words that we can use. But, ultimately, what we’re trying to do is say that employers really have a role in helping people reflect on what that purpose is. And part of that reflection is identifying those areas where people feel alive, they feel passionate, they feel energized. And recognizing those areas will help people reflect on what that sense of purpose is and how to find more purpose in their day-to-day work.', 'Diane Brady: So does the organization’s purpose matter, Bill? That is the one thing leaders can control. What difference does it make in aligning that with the individual’s purpose?', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, look, the data here was surprisingly strong. This would be one of those points where Naina could easily say to me, “I told you so.” When someone is looking for the time they spend at work to have purpose and needs alignment between the organization’s purpose and their own, it’s a multiple win in terms of good outcomes, of employees wanting to stay and feeling like it’s a good place to work and for their intention to stay and strive. And it has this huge uplift when you have a great alignment between the organization’s purpose and the individual’s purpose. What was interesting was the context where the person wasn’t looking for the organization to provide it, but the organization was doing a great job of helping people be on purpose.', 'I think the language that Naina was using there really matters. Being on purpose maybe sounds a little bit like being on brand. It’s where you’re not creating credibility problems. You’re not creating discontinuities between what you say and what you do. Where you’re truly living credibly and honestly and authentically. Even when a person didn’t initially say, “Oh, I need this from my employer,” when the employer was doing it, there was still an uplift. So then you had to say, “Well, what about the alternative?”', 'Well, that’s where it gets a little scary. If a person showed up believing the organization stood for one thing and they really needed the organization’s purpose to line up with their own, and then the organization violated this, it was just that, a violation. It had significant downticks in the person’s willingness to stay, their engagement, their involvement. You’d see a direct link to performance. Also, for most people, that creates so much dissonance that they usually leave.', 'Diane Brady: So hypocrisy is worse than having no stated purpose at all?', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, right. You could say, “Hey, this is transactional.” There’s huge portions of the gig economy and other places where some companies have basically tried to marginalize employees and say, “Oh look, they’re their own contractors.” That’s economic exchange, not social exchange. I’m certain for some people that’s OK, but you shouldn’t try to pass it off for what it isn’t.', 'Diane Brady: There’s a lot of focus right now on wellness, Naina, and what we can do for employees, with the recognition that certain groups—working mothers and others—have really suffered during this pandemic and have opted out of work. What are some of the levers that you can use in this situation, since we can’t give people a sense of purpose other than giving them space to reflect? Is there anything else that can be done to heighten the engagement and make it easier for people to feel purpose in what they do?', 'Naina Dhingra: Well, let me build on what Bill was saying—this idea of what companies can control and this idea that there’s actually an incredible unlock that happens when an individual sense of purpose is lined up with the company’s sense of purpose. We’ve found employees are five and a half times more likely to say they’re fulfilling their purpose at work if that purpose is aligned with their company’s.', 'The individual alone has agency in deciding what their purpose is and whether or not it aligns with the company’s.', 'So where companies can start is understanding that you’re not getting anywhere unless you have an authentic organizational purpose. This is a time in which there is tremendous change going on in the world. Having an authentic organizational purpose is about spending real time reflecting on the impact a company has on the world. It’s not just about nice corporate-social-responsibility contributions and making big statements. It’s actually about engaging your employees on what that impact is. And what we found is that employees who say their organiza\\xadtions spend real time reflecting on the impact they make on the world are five times more likely to be excited to work for the company.', 'These reflections and dialogues are one of the things that we’re most excited about really helping our clients with, and helping ourselves at McKinsey as well. There’s an opportunity to really pause and reflect on the individual’s sense of purpose and how that links with the company and what the company is trying to do for the world—especially at this moment, when there are so many things going on in the world that really demand business to make a greater contribution to society.', 'Diane Brady: You know, as we’ve been talking, I’ve been thinking, “What’s my sense of purpose?” I can articulate a couple of different things that drive me, and I certainly feel purpose in what I do. But I’d be curious to know, since you are both on the front lines, how would you articulate your own sense of purpose? Bill, I’m going to go to you first.', 'Bill Schaninger: Yeah, it’s a great question. You know, throughout this conversation I was reflecting on the distance between my mom and me. My mom was a teen parent. She was barely 17 when I was born and had both of her kids by the time she was 20. She was a good student through school—and likely would’ve gone to college and then had kids. At that time, in the late ’60s and early ’70s, she didn’t go to college. In fact, she was actually kicked out of high school. But as soon as I was, I don’t know, six or something, so my sister would’ve been three, my mom had a real desire to go get a job.', 'A good portion of that job was just that there needed to be something more to her life than being a housewife and a mom. It didn’t mean she didn’t love us or didn’t love my dad. But she needed something for her. Some sense of freedom. Some sense of belonging to something outside the home, not being defined by it. And so for her, a lot of it really had to do with freedom and, to some extent, contributing to the family economics. But mostly it was about freedom and autonomy and being able to enjoy something. So she ended up becoming a bookkeeper—you know, accounts payable, accounts receivable—and then, over the course of 20 years, ended up running a plumbing-supply house, being the general manager. A rather phenomenal arc, honestly.', 'Diane Brady: Definitely!', 'Bill Schaninger: But a lot of that was under this basic idea of freedom and then enjoyment. But I think in her case, there was also some gender-norm busting, if you consider the ’70s and early ’80s. Now, in my own case, it’s almost entirely that I get unbelievable enjoyment out of being good at something or being believed to be good at something. Being part of a place that has such a really great institutional reputation like McKinsey.', 'You know, in many conversations, Naina and I anchor on this one phrase: “We’re not going to make stuff up.” Anybody can make stuff up. We’re going to make sure that what we say is right. That is core to my purpose. I would have been an academic had I not come to McKinsey. I’d be a professor somewhere, teaching about behavior and HR and management. The firm has really allowed me to tap into my professional purpose, which is advancing the cause of the human condition at work. Why do people behave the way they do at work? Why do leaders behave the way they do at work?', 'That was the first decade of my McKinsey career. After I got elected partner, I started feeling a greater and greater need. And my own personal situation improved and changed, obviously. A huge portion of it was, “Boy, I’ve got to do something for the kids who are like me.” And then it went from having the freedom, the ability to choose whether I worked or not, to things like caring and equality and security. Taking care of the ones I love, expanding beyond my immediate family to making sure my mom had a house and was set up, taking care of my godchildren. But then I started looking around where we were living, and certainly here in the Lehigh Valley, in Pennsylvania, it was just, “Well, how can I help kids who were like me?”', 'And McKinsey helped facilitate that, either through not-for-profit boards or what I do with—well, frankly, excess income. Do you fund scholarships? Do you fund summer programs? So if I compare and contrast the difference between my mom and me, a lot of this purpose, for her, was that she loved being part of something that was outside the house that she could be good at, have competence at, and get the reward of doing what she felt she could maximize to do more.', 'For me, I was afforded the luxury of always being told I was going to be the first one to go to school and make something of myself, in air quotes, and then I landed at McKinsey. And Naina and I were talking about an organization being able to help a person define their purpose. My purpose, initially, was rather narrow. It was that McKinsey was going to be two or three years. I’d get the stories and hightail it back to academics.', 'Diane Brady: Your initial purpose.', 'Bill Schaninger: Right. Initially, the purpose was just to make me a better academic, a better professor. I didn’t count on loving it so much. I didn’t count on realizing that, wow, we can really help change these organizations—change the quality of the professional and personal lives of the clients we’re working with. And I’m sure when you talk to Naina, even 30 seconds in, there’s stories of some of the clients she’s serving. She’s personal friends with many of them. Many of them have had these pivotal moments in their careers and their lives where she’s helped them.', 'At least for me, I didn’t count on how much I was going to get enjoyment and satisfaction and personal pride out of helping our clients. And then, eventually, it just became doing not-for-profit work, helping large civic institutions try to help make everybody’s life better. And so this arc, I think it can change over time. I think it usually starts with some version of freedom or caring or sustaining the people around you and can migrate. And when an organization plays it right, it helps people through that progression, and it helps them see broader opportunities so that when they excel, everybody can excel.', 'Diane Brady: It’s very interesting to think about the recognition of purpose and where somebody is in their career. Naina, I’m curious. What’s your sense of purpose?', 'Naina Dhingra: You know, I was listening to Bill’s story, and the way I would describe myself is truly as an accidental consultant who, in my heart of hearts, is still the 20-year-old AIDS activist, almost getting arrested at the Republican National Convention. You know, throwing stones in different areas of big protests in Washington, DC. I grew up as a Sikh. Religion was very important in my family. And one of the tenets of Sikhism is equality and social justice and this desire to fight against things that are not right.', 'That was a huge part of my upbringing and really followed me in my 20s, which were about being a social-justice activist. I somehow found myself at McKinsey, in our Nonprofit Practice, and very much described my sense of purpose as about equitable healthcare. I was working a lot on issues of AIDS in Africa, malaria, tuberculosis, and very much felt McKinsey was a place for skills training to help me fulfill that purpose. I would be able to fulfill that sense of purpose outside of McKinsey, but I needed greater skills.', 'And lo and behold, ten years later, somehow I’m here as a partner. And I would say, do I still have that sense of purpose? Very much. Very much. It is a core part of who I am, this idea of equitable healthcare access. But my sense of purpose has evolved and grown through my experiences, particularly my reflecting on what I see as the powerful role of business to help solve humanity’s greatest challenges—as somebody who grew up in non\\xadprofits and grassroots campaigns and working with the UN, to then really seeing the platform that business has. And working with a number of clients, in particular pharmaceutical companies, and seeing their passion and commitment toward solving some of the greatest global health challenges of our time. And so I think purpose is something; there is an innate sense of it that I’ve had.', 'But there is an evolution that happens, based on one’s experiences, the people that one meets—and that’s one of the reasons why, ten years later, I still work at McKinsey, even though many of my same friends working in many of these public-health institutions crack up at the idea that I’m a pharma consultant and management consultant who works on all of these interesting topics. But still, in my heart of hearts I’m really this AIDS activist.', 'Diane Brady: What advice do you have for the two thirds–plus of people out there who don’t feel that sense of purpose, who certainly may be grateful to have a job or may be looking for a job? What can they be doing to ignite a sense of purpose in themselves if their employers are not doing it? Bill?', 'Bill Schaninger: Yeah, I was just reflecting on your question. It’s a really good one. I’ve often thought that when talking about this, I wanted to make sure that I wasn’t forgetting the very real condition for a lot of people, which is that employment is necessary. It’s necessary so they can put food on the table and a roof over the heads of the people they love. I don’t think we should ever look past that or diminish it. I do think there’s an opportunity for organizations when someone arrives at your doorstep because it’s a job. Maybe you have an opportunity by just running the place a little bit better for them to see some meaning in it, to see some purpose in it.', 'I remember I said to my mom, “Why is it so important to be a bookkeeper? Why would you not want to be at home every day when we get home from school?” And my mom said to both my sister and me, “Look, you just see it as a job. But it’s my job. And I need to know that what I do there, I do really well and I’m good at it.” That stuck with me quite a bit. Because if I’m honest, as a teenager, things came naturally to me and I didn’t necessarily work as hard.', 'I think she was trying to impart this idea that there is satisfaction in doing something well that’s yours, that you identify with, that you affiliate with. My hope is that by engaging on this, organizations can see an opportunity to really lay out a clear path for people and say, “This is what we stand for here at this place. If you want to join us, we’re going to help you. We’re going to help you make more meaning of it than its being just a job.” Any job can have meaning. Any job can help fulfill performance. It does require the organization to live into it. It requires the organization to be well run.', 'I think for individuals, it’s important to see through a lens of just how important purpose is for autonomy, how important it is for freedom, for stability, for caring for others, or moving into what Naina was talking about in terms of equality and equity. You may not fulfill all of them but you can certainly fulfill some of them. And I think one of the things we’re seeing is that as people have more time, they have more affinity. They have more belonging. They have more attachment to what the organization is doing and what they’re doing individually. So maybe it becomes a bit of a virtuous cycle and it can be reinforcing.', 'Diane Brady: Great. Naina, any thoughts that you have for listeners out there who may or may not be feeling a sense of purpose?', 'Naina Dhingra: I would offer two simple questions to reflect on over a month, every day. When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most drained? I think reflecting on those two questions over a 30-day period may offer some really interesting insights about how you might feel about what’s going on at work, what’s going on in your life, and help you on a path to reflecting on what that sense of purpose might be.', 'Diane Brady: I think that’s great advice. I can’t think of a better place to leave than that. Naina Dhingra, Bill Schaninger, thank you very much for joining us.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thank you; it was a great conversation.', 'Naina Dhingra: My pleasure. Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: And thank you to the listeners out there. Whether you have found your purpose or not, you’ll certainly find more information on how to nurture it within your company and nurture it within yourself at McKinsey.com. I’m Diane Brady. I look forward to seeing you next time.']","[[-0.5673828   0.65234375  2.3847656  ...  1.6201172  -1.6103516

27,How air travel is evolving postpandemic,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/how-air-travel-is-evolving-postpandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic decimated airlines in 2020, yet there are reasons for optimism as the industry looks to recovery.","['The COVID-19 pandemic decimated airlines in 2020, yet there are reasons for optimism as the industry looks to recovery.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with partners Alex Dichter and Robin Riedel about the outlook for airlines and other industry players. An edited version of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. During the COVID-19 pandemic, few industries have been harder hit than airlines. As we recover, few will have more challenges getting back to normal. Joining me are two McKinsey partners who have been working on these issues for years. Alex Dichter is a senior partner in London who leads McKinsey’s Travel, Logistics & Infrastructure Practice. Robin Riedel is a partner in McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice who leads the advanced-air-mobility group for the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility out of San Francisco.', 'Alex, let’s start with you. Give us some sense of the current state of air travel.', 'Alex Dichter: Most of the world’s travel went to almost nothing in April and May [2020]. At one point, we were running at about minus 95 percent, if we compared traffic in 2020 to 2019 during the same period. Obviously, some parts of the world have gone back to some degree of normalcy. If we were to look at air travel in mainland China, for instance, where the virus has been well contained, domestic travel is near normal. New Zealand and Australia, at least internally, have gone back to something that starts to look and feel like normal, and the US has some domestic traffic.', 'For virtually every other part of the world, what’s stopping international travel, and to some extent domestic travel, is the wide array of restrictions associated with travel. Everybody wants to go on vacation. Everybody wants to see their friends and family. But if you have to get tested and quarantine on the way back, it starts to look like a daunting task. That has kept international travel to a near minimum. In fact, one of the only reasons that we see a reasonable number of long-haul flights still in place is that cargo demand is relatively strong.', 'Diane Brady: This is an industry that has felt vulnerable for years, even before this degree of disruption. What is the economic fallout?', 'Robin Riedel: To put it into numbers, and just for last year, 2020, the estimated impact on airlines is about a $370 billion revenue loss versus 2019.', 'It’s a massive hole that the industry’s in, and that’s just the airlines. You also have the supply chain and other sectors or subsectors. You add all of that together and you’re getting close to half a trillion dollars of losses across the airline or air-travel industries. That loss has impacted the companies, on the one hand, but also the employees, on the other. We’ve seen pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and all kinds of workers lose their jobs over this crisis, and with an unclear path to come back.', 'The question of how many airlines will survive, to a large degree, will depend on some of the government support that is out there, what the recovery really will look like, and whether we will see a significant jump back to pre-COVID-19 levels of this year, or whether it will take until ’22, ’23, or even ’24 before we’ll see travelers and revenue come back.', 'Diane Brady: Alex, can you give us some sense of what normalcy will look like?', 'Alex Dichter: Predicting the future is always a dangerous game. There are two fundamental axes here. One is the degree to which the world recovers from the economic fallout associated with COVID-19, and two is the speed at which we put the virus functionally behind us.', 'It’s clear that the virus is lasting much longer than we all hoped it would back in March or April of last year. It’s equally clear that the speed at which vaccines have been developed has surprised a lot of people.', 'We’re starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel, even if the remaining bit of the tunnel is still long. While the economic fallout has no doubt been significant, we’ve not seen a crash in global markets, for example, and asset prices have continued to hold up.', 'Corporate balance sheets are also relatively strong, so there’s good news amid the bad. Our more pessimistic scenario would have demand not recovering until 2024. If you were to double-click on that, you’d see a much faster recovery for leisure traffic than you would see for business traffic.', 'Businesses, even if they’re financially healthy, have all learned that technologies like Teams and Zoom and Webex are working relatively well and can replace some of the travel that they used to do. Technologies will likely replace that travel in the future.', 'The more optimistic scenario might have us back to normal, or at least back to 2019 volumes, by the end of 2022. The one caveat I would make is that in this industry, you can’t have more passengers than you have seats. This is an industry where we make relatively important decisions about capacity with long lead times. You can’t snap your fingers and bring back planes that you’ve parked in the desert. To recall furloughed pilots, it takes time. Even if demand comes back sooner, it may be that we don’t see the volumes come back until well into 2023, simply because the industry isn’t yet prepared to accept those passengers.', 'This is an industry where we make relatively important decisions about capacity with long lead times. You can’t snap your fingers and bring back planes that you’ve parked in the desert.', 'Diane Brady: Robin, you’re out there on the front lines, talking to executives, employees, and engineers. Can you give us a sense of just what people have been doing to cope and survive this?', 'Robin Riedel: It’s a really challenging time for the executives of these companies and for the employees. I’ve been heartened by many of the actions we’ve seen where companies really have stepped forward to try to protect jobs as much as they could.', 'Employees and their unions have leaned forward to find creative arrangements that will protect jobs, help the companies survive, and work much more hand in hand than they have in the past. There have been a number of deals that reduce flying hours for individual pilots, keeping the overall number of pilots at a higher level—or reduce certain compensation packages for the short term so that the financials work out in these difficult times. That has been heartening to see. At the same time, we’ve seen massive layoffs despite all of that.', 'In particular, on the pilot’s side, it’s a challenging situation. As a pilot, you need to remain certified and stay in the role to feel comfortable flying. Many pilots who have been laid off don’t really have an opportunity to go somewhere else to fly.', 'They’re probably going to spend a year or two or three not flying before they get recalled. By then, they might have switched into another industry. They might feel that they have really lost skills and need significant training to come back to flying. There’s a good chance that this will cause what we would consider to be a pilot shortage in a couple of years, simply because there are enough people leaving the industry as a result of all of this.', 'Diane Brady: Alex, you mentioned the shift between the ratio of leisure to business. Airlines are constantly innovating on that front. I remember talking to somebody at a café once even about how they place the bathrooms, and how many bathrooms they have on different flights depending on how much beer people drink. How is this shifting the focus of the investments that these airlines are making, both now and in anticipation of a recovery?', 'Alex Dichter: There are a number of changes. On the investment front, it really depends on what kind of airline you are. Certainly, there are airlines whose hubs are in cities with enormous volumes of high-end business traffic: the banking sector, the consulting sector, the legal sector. These people historically have flown a lot, and they typically fly at the front end of the cabin. You would see airlines where the number of business-class seats could exceed the number of economy-class seats.', 'Many of those companies will struggle to fill those cabins in a post-COVID-19 world at first. We will see a shift in thinking about that. Over the past several years, one of the biggest growth segments that we’ve seen has been high-end leisure.', 'These are not necessarily very wealthy people, but people who see travel as the most important use of their disposable income and are willing to splurge for a better experience. If you looked across business-class cabins of many airlines over the past few years, you would’ve seen a number of people with loosened ties and their laptops out. But you’d also see couples clinking their champagne glasses and families and honeymooners and retirees. That will be a really important segment post-COVID-19. While a hundred business-class seats in some cases may be too much for that segment, 50 certainly isn’t.', 'The corporate market tends to pay very high prices, and they tend to book relatively late. It wouldn’t be unusual to look at a flight between London and New York a month out and see that the seat map is two-thirds empty, only to find it relatively full on the day of departure.', 'Leisure passengers tend to book earlier. Historically, airlines have held back on the number of leisure passengers that they would allow into those seats, waiting for corporate travelers to show up. We may see a shift in that dynamic, where we allow more seats to be sold earlier, perhaps at lower prices.', 'With that might come a shift toward point-to-point traffic, people who are actually going between London and New York versus people who are connecting through London from another market. All of that will likely result in lower average revenues, but it doesn’t have to result in dramatically lower average revenues.', 'Diane Brady: Robin, I’ve been looking at seat sales to Miami from New York, for example, for $60 round trip. It does feel like it’s going to be hard to wean people off of some of these extremely low fares that we’ve become addicted to in the past few years, even prior to the pandemic. What do you see there in terms of pricing power?', 'Robin Riedel: On the pricing side, the challenge we’re having is that the systems that manage the pricing, revenue-management systems, and pricing systems, in many cases, rely on past information and past data. However, past information is not that helpful right now to figure out what passengers really want or what people are willing to pay.', 'What we’re finding with our clients is that customers are much less elastic than they were before. Before, you could throw out a very low fare and people would flock to it. Right now, it’s not necessarily the fare that makes people travel or hold them back, but it’s the fear of getting infected or the fear of being away from home and the door shutting on them. Pricing is a very challenging topic right now where there’s very little precedence we can rely on.', 'That being said, airlines are making some progress in using what we would call nontraditional data sources and really trying to understand what drives willingness to pay. What are customers really looking for and willing to pay for in this new scenario? Airlines are looking at search trends, looking at customer sentiments, and looking at how people search across a website.', 'All of those kinds of things are starting to flow into the revenue-management systems and will hopefully help us manage prices back up to a more sustainable level, instead of lowering them and lowering them, trying to stimulate traffic that is really not that possible right now.', 'Diane Brady: Alex, I know you’ve done a lot of work with McKinsey regarding sustainability. COVID-19 has almost distracted us from what a terrible year 2020 was. I think it was the hottest year on record.', 'The airline industry has been front and center, both as an emitter of greenhouse-gas emissions and as an innovator on that front. Has COVID-19 shifted the focus of the industry on this issue?', 'Alex Dichter: Yes and no. I don’t know a single CEO who believes that sustainability is not coming back to the agenda as a critical topic. It is something that our corporate clients are demanding, and our corporate clients are demanding it because their employees and their customers are demanding it of them.', 'The good news is that those who are working on technology innovation—the development of sustainable aviation fuels, the use of hydrogen, electrification, and such—have been working around the clock and haven’t taken any time off.', 'Robin Riedel: There’s almost not a week right now where we’re not meeting with senior executives in the industry talking about sustainability. I’m both surprised and excited about the fact that this is happening, and that COVID-19 has not made this a second-order item. It’s still on the top of the agenda for many of the industry executives.', 'We see airlines all over the world wondering what to do. Some are working with offsets, and some are working by buying sustainable aviation fuel and trying to spur that industry. Some are investing in future technology for propulsion, whether it’s electric or hydrogen combustion or similar technologies. We’re seeing an influx of investment in that sector.', 'Diane Brady: There was so much excitement around personalized air travel before the pandemic. Are those conversations taking a backseat to recovery? Or are we still seeing the investments in AI [artificial intelligence] and some of the other areas that might advance air travel beyond where we are today?', 'Robin Riedel: We’ll have to separate these future models, which are a shorter distance. Some people would refer to them as the equivalent of flying cars. These are smaller aircraft that fly, let’s say, up to 300 or 500 miles.', 'That is a new industry. It’s driven by a number of major trends, one being electrification and battery density. We’re getting to a point when it becomes technically feasible to have vehicles that operate that way. There’s also the drive for more sustainability.', 'The advance of AI makes some of this more effective. Last, but not least, is the interest of the customer to look at mobility as a service. Customers no longer just want to own a car and drive everywhere, but to hail a rideshare or look at sharing different modes.', 'When taken together, these trends create a fertile environment for a new mode of air transportation. We track more than 250 companies out there that are trying to play in the space. There are probably about a dozen or so of them that have significant funding by now.', 'We see a number of prototypes flying around. There are real expectations that in the next three to four years, we will see the first commercial models of these arrive in our cities. What form that will take, whether it’s helicopter-like from one rooftop to another, or a regional model that uses airports or airport-like infrastructure to go from one city to another, is to be seen. All of these have some promise. The devil is going to be in the execution and in the detail, but it surely is an exciting time for that space.', 'Diane Brady: How is that picture changing, especially in a part of the world where air travel is more back to normal?', 'Alex Dichter: Over the short and medium-term, we see some clear shifts.', 'We’re seeing a bias toward fewer flights and typically larger aircraft. Get as many people as you can on each one of your relatively few flights. The other reason for that is there is cargo demand. Larger aircraft do a better job of accommodating cargo than do smaller aircraft.', 'As we look forward, we’ll see airlines looking for more fuel-efficient aircraft. They will be looking for aircraft with more customer-friendly features like Wi-Fi and upgraded business-class cabins and bigger overhead bins.', 'The interest in 100-seat aircraft will exist for some of the same reasons that were the case before COVID-19. Those aircraft are very useful at filling in city pairs that demand a lower cost structure than can be achieved with a 50- or 70-seat aircraft but don’t need 140 or 150 seats in order to achieve reasonable load factors.', 'The only thing that the industry expects to change is the amount of global investment in long-haul wide-body capacity. The reason for that is pre-COVID-19, many of the world’s airplanes that were flying on long-haul routes were losing money.', 'They were losing money because they were flown by relatively small airlines, in many cases backed by states, whose objectives went beyond profit. It was important to have these routes for political reasons: for pride, national sovereignty, and, in some cases, thoughtful links to economic development. Many governments are coming back around and saying, “Look. We’ve got a lot of priorities for a stretched state’s treasury. We’re not going to be able to keep funding loss-making operations forever.”', 'We’re seeing more and more governments asking their state-linked airlines to come up with plans that enable them to be financially sustainable. In many cases, that will mean smaller long-haul networks with fewer aircraft, which is good for carbon emissions, but probably not great for long-haul ticket prices.', 'Diane Brady: You both must be road warriors who also had your plans and travel put on hold. I’m personally very eager to get back on a plane again. Is that something that you welcome?', 'Robin Riedel: Yes. It’s a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, I’m glad to be home more right now. We have an infant in the house. It’s fantastic to be between meetings or at the end of the day and to be able to see my son. I appreciate not being on the road all the time anymore.', 'At the same time, I truly miss seeing my clients and my friends and my family. I just did the math the other day and this is the longest I’ve gone without seeing my parents in my life. That weighs heavily on me. There’s some positive and some negative in the lack of travel right now.', 'Diane Brady: What about for you, Alex?', 'Alex Dichter: First, prior to COVID-19 I was traveling more than virtually anyone that I’ve ever met. Typically, I would be in three continents in a week. I sleep well on planes. My pattern would be, I would get on a plane at night. I’d go to sleep. I’d wake up in another continent. I’d have a full day of meetings. I’d get on another plane that night, go to sleep, wake up on another continent, and end up back at home Thursday night or Friday morning. That allowed me to cover a lot of ground, see a lot of people, and do so in a way that was relatively sustainable from a lifestyle standpoint. Remember, I sleep well on planes, so I got as much sleep on the plane as I would typically get at home, and in some cases more. That has changed dramatically.', 'I have been on a few flights, particularly on the long haul. As an aside, some of the conversations I’ve had with crew have really been touching. I was on a flight between the US and London with eight passengers on board. The crew were practically in tears. It was their first flight in months. They understand very well that without passengers, they don’t have a future. I certainly hope for their sake that we see as much of the demand coming back as possible. Like Robin, I see some benefits to this.', 'I find interacting with my colleagues, whom I know well, to be much more efficient via these kinds of technologies. I don’t need to read their body language. I do want to see them on some cycle, but we can get a lot done very quickly.', 'The fact that nobody is traveling also means that calendars are much less rigid. If I want to get a client together with me for a discussion, I usually find an hour within a couple of days. In the old world, we’d often go back and forth for a couple of weeks trying to match up calendars and find a time when we could both be in the same spot on the globe when neither of us were someplace else.', 'That will be something that I don’t want to give up. At the same time, I am in this business because I want to help people. I like people, and I like getting to know my clients on a personal level. That is hard to do via Zoom.', 'I will do a lot less internal travel. I will replace some of that space with more client travel. The other thing that I’ve noted, and I’ve heard others say the same, is that in the future, I may need to see in person everyone in my personal network less frequently. Every two out of three interactions we can do remotely, I’m also meeting more people.', 'I wouldn’t be surprised if a couple of years from now, you find me doing as much travel as I was doing before, but perhaps getting more out of it.', 'Diane Brady: To those in the industry, any advice?', 'Robin Riedel: There are a couple of things worth keeping top of mind here. One, making sure to understand what are the relative risks and what does the latest research show about what is considered safe, or what is relatively safe, versus what is risky behavior? Even within travel, with the many studies that have been done, there’s enough evidence to show that air travel is relatively safe, and you can protect yourself with a few measures.', 'The second thing is to really think through what is essential travel; how do you define that, and guide your organization? The questions are going to be, “How do you roll back into travel? Do you just go back to where you were before, or do you adjust your travel policy and make some adjustments for things like safety, the environment, and how we’ve all learned to work with modern technology to avoid some of the travel?”', 'Diane Brady: Alex, anything you’d want to add?', 'Alex Dichter: Everyone needs to be prepared for a two-speed recovery or return over the course of the next 12 months. None of us really know how the summer is going to play out.', 'Expansion may prove to be complicated. When demand falls off, your reduction in capacity trails the falloff in demand, almost by definition. When there are fewer people on planes, you reduce flights. As you reduce flights, you reduce pilots.', 'When demand comes back very quickly, by definition, it will come back faster than you can bring capacity on board. At a time when airlines are going to be looking for as much goodwill as they can get from governments, labor unions, and their passengers, there’s a very high risk that we’ll see long queues in airports, lots of delays, and canceled flights. We’re simply not ready for the demand that appears, and I wish I had a better answer as to which one to prepare for. We need to be ready for both.', 'I would also leave airline executives with a longer-term thought. I hope that five years from now, everyone will still be talking about COVID-19 agility. What I mean by that is the speed at which we were able to get difficult things done during COVID-19.', 'Many airlines have moved to a world where what used to be eight-week, 12-week planning cycles are now done in one to two weeks.', 'My hope is that we retain some of these learnings, and maybe move to a world where we stop telling ourselves that every major innovation needs to, by definition, take several years to implement. We can start acting a little bit more like digital leaders, who tend to get things done quite quickly in a trial-and-error kind of way. I’m speaking more about the commercial side than I am about operations, where safety is paramount in our industry.', 'Diane Brady: Can you give me some sense of what’s on your radar and what you’re watching over the next year in general with regard to the industry?', 'Robin Riedel: There are probably four or five different themes here that are becoming important into 2021 beyond COVID-19. We need to get more serious and find better ways to abate some of the carbon we’re producing.', 'A second theme will be what we call the future of air mobility: the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing [eVTOL] space or advanced-air-mobility space.', 'Another theme we haven’t talked about is cargo transportation by drone. We’re seeing a broad number of trials around the world where vaccinations or blood transfusions, or even medication and e-commerce packages, are transported by drones over the short range or over the long range for the last mile.', 'In the more traditional airlines, customer experience is going to be one to watch. As we come through COVID-19, smart airlines will take this as an opportunity to make things not just safer but also better. Whether that is self-service at the airport, some of the digital offerings they have, or onboard product, we’re seeing a number of changes coming that will make travel better in the future.', 'Diane Brady: Alex, what would be on your radar for people to watch over the next year?', 'Alex Dichter: I’m hopeful that we’ll see a couple of things. We’ll start to move from a world where the industry is focused on survival to a world where at least parts of the industry are focused on long-term success.', 'Let’s recognize that this is an industry that, for the better part of its 75-plus-year existence, has not made a dime. Part of that has to do with a very challenging structure: too many airlines, outdated regulations, very powerful supply chains.', 'I’m looking forward to some of the innovations that will naturally come out of this. Several of the changes that the industry has put in place during COVID-19, particularly moving from physical touchpoints to digital touchpoints, are hugely relevant. Digital technologies allow people a sense of control and transparency that I think everyone wants. As a passenger, I’m looking forward to some of those changes.', 'Diane Brady: So much fodder. If you’d like to hear more, please do go to McKinsey.com. We’ve been speaking with Alex Dichter and Robin Riedel. Alex and Robin, thank you so much for joining us.', 'Robin Riedel: Thank you for having us, Diane.

28,Stakeholder capitalism: A conversation with Vivian Hunt and Paul Polman,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/stakeholder-capitalism-a-conversation-with-vivian-hunt-and-paul-polman,Why companies must now compete on trust and deliver value to multiple stakeholders.,"['Why companies must now compete on trust and deliver value to multiple stakeholders.', 'Business leaders talk about serving their customers, employees, suppliers, and many others in the communities they touch. But job one is serving up profits to shareholders. That’s starting to change. In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey senior partner Dame Vivian Hunt and former Unilever CEO Paul Polman, now cofounder and cochair of IMAGINE, talk about the growing imperative for stakeholder capitalism—and how building long-term value for everyone is increasingly good for the bottom line. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. In this episode, we’re talking about stakeholder capitalism with two people who are leaders and, in my view, the gold standard in this area. First, my colleague Dame Vivian Hunt. She’s a senior partner in McKinsey’s London office who has done a lot of work both within the firm and with clients in stakeholder capitalism. In 2018, she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services to the economy and also to women in business. Vivian, welcome.', 'Vivian Hunt: Thank you, Diane. It’s a pleasure to be here.', 'Diane Brady: As CEO of Unilever for ten years, Paul ran what was not only one of the best-performing companies in the sector, but also one that was a real pioneer in stakeholder capitalism. When he stepped down in 2019, he became cofounder and cochair of IMAGINE, where he is now helping other companies to achieve these goals. He’s also chair of Oxford Saïd Business School, as well as honorary chair of the International Chamber of Commerce. Paul, welcome.', 'Paul Polman: Thank you, Diane. I look forward to it.', 'Diane Brady: Vivian, stakeholder capitalism. It’s a term we’ve heard for a couple of years now. What exactly does it mean?', 'Vivian Hunt: You’re right, Diane. Stakeholder capitalism is not new. It is a broader concept than shareholder capitalism. Absolutely at the core is a successful business that delivers on the economic returns over the mid and long term that any shareholder or investor would expect. But stakeholder capitalism is broader. By considering everyone that a company’s actions touch—whether that’s employees, suppliers, activists, consumers, local communities, the environmental context—it requires companies to take a broader consideration of who their stakeholders are, and to factor that into their strategy and choices.', 'The good news is we know companies that do that are more resilient and also perform better. They also have more success in building trust, which is important for their long-term success. It’s clear that, in 2020, the multiple priorities and crises that the world and the economy were facing came into really sharp relief. We’re still living and managing through it, but it reminded us, in a pretty foundational way, that we live in a dynamic system.', 'The fact that the crisis had multiple vectors—health, economic, social justice, technology, and uneven effects around the world—really reminded business leaders that we have to respond in a different way. Businesses have realized a pretty urgent need for change, not just because of 2020, but the cumulative effect of these crises. Whether they’re your employees, activists, different trenches of investors, or customers, understanding stakeholder needs and managing them better and in a more holistic way came to the fore.', 'Diane Brady: Paul, you are somebody who has been talking about this for years. I’d love to get a sense as to how your thinking has evolved on stakeholder capitalism. Why did it matter to you at Unilever?', 'Paul Polman: I fully agree that the current model, which is basically shareholder primacy as a prevailing model, is a failed doctrine. That has shown to destroy the natural resources, the social cohesion. Vivian has talked about some of the effects that we’ve seen quite transparently during the COVID-19 pandemic. A longer-term, multistakeholder model has always been more attractive to me.', 'I’ve always believed that business needs to be accepted by society. Competing on trust and responsibility are probably some of the most important things that it has to do, as well as creating this deeper relationship with all of its stakeholders that has built on that trust, that has built on that truce, and on these failures, if you want to. I’ve felt from day one that I entered business, which was a little bit by serendipity, that I didn’t want to be part of creating the world’s problems, but I wanted to be part of solving the world’s problems. And I don’t think you want to work for a company where you keep earning when the world is burning.', 'This is what we are facing right now with climate change. When I entered Unilever it was not a company that was in good shape. It had significantly seen its turnover decline over decades. It had seen its share price stabilize or decline when the rest of the world was moving up.', 'There was something in the book from Jim Collins, Good to Great, that’s about nurturing the core before you stimulate progress. That resonated with me. So I went back to the core, to Lord Lever, at the end of the 19th century, when he already talked about shared prosperity, when the purpose of his company was to make hygiene commonplace in Victorian Britain, where one out of two babies wouldn’t make it past age one.', 'He was entirely focused on building a multistakeholder model, not just a shareholder-primacy model. That was very appealing to me, that these boundaries that the company operated under were redefined to be a little bit broader than just pure performance, or pure financial data, but also started to include people, planet, and profit, if you want to. That was the beginning of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan that we put out in 2010, more or less.', 'Diane Brady: Vivian, I heard you echo Good to Great.', 'Vivian Hunt: Many companies, if they go back to their foundation—where did we start, what was our original purpose—when they look at those foundational principles, many companies incorporated. They joined together financial capital, human capital, and systems to do something more than just make money. The notion was that you had to have a healthy business that created an economic profit, so the shareholder capitalism and the economic imperative is, of course, at the core. But most companies, at their foundation, had more than that in their system.', 'When businesses really look at their heritage, when they go back to their original purpose statements, they often find seeds, the roots of the solution to the problems we face today.', 'Whether it’s the foundation of Unilever or Hershey in the US, many Japanese companies, German companies, you see many, many incorporations that were really about the corporate body, people collaborating, working together in different ways in an organized system. When businesses really look at their heritage, when they go back to their original purpose statements, they often find seeds, the roots of the solution to the problems we face today. The journey that Paul and Unilever went on during your early days is a familiar one, where you often hear CEOs and leaders going back to their roots to understand more deeply, or to challenge, improve, contradict what’s in their history. Many companies now would be well served by going back to their roots and checking how it fits with this notion of a broader purpose, including, but beyond, economics.', 'Paul Polman: You go back to the core to learn from that, but then you have to adjust your plans to the current realities, which are often quite starkly different from when the company began. I entered Unilever at the height of the financial crisis, where it was clear to me that our system was failing us. Our system was too high a level of private or public debt, over consumption, and leaving too many people behind would ultimately rebel against itself. Unfortunately, during the financial crisis ten years ago, we didn’t heed those lessons.', 'Climate change went up on a very dangerous trajectory. Inequality further increased. We saw that expressed at the polls in populism or xenophobia, increased nationalism, and a decrease in multilateralism. But we also saw that at the people level, with more and more people in the streets or speaking up that they really expected the companies they work for to take a more socially responsible model.', 'That’s why I’ve often thought that what we need to do is move from CSR—corporate social responsibility, which is really becoming less bad—and partly addressing some of these issues, but still to your own benefit. We need to move to RSC, which is responsible social corporations. As a responsible social corporation, you really try to be net positive.', 'Too many companies, even today, think that they can outsource their value chain, and by doing so, outsource they responsibilities as well. That simply doesn’t work anymore. So this moves it up to a much higher level by putting purpose at the core, by putting sustainability at the core.', 'It even goes beyond this Business Roundtable statement from the US, where you don’t put profits or shareholders at par, but where you actually say, “We focus on all these other stakeholders, and by doing so, you’ll have better profits and better shareholder return.” It’s a result of what you do. It’s actually not the reason for doing, no different than the white blood cells in your body. We need the white blood cells to live, but I hope that we agree that we don’t live for the white blood cells.', 'Diane Brady: Vivian, one of the prerequisites for cooperation is trust. And that is something that has not really been a surplus when it comes to how people view business. How much is that an obstacle?', 'Vivian Hunt: There are probably two obstacles to the pivot that Paul’s describing. One is recognizing that you need to have more holistic multivariant objectives but not knowing how to track and measure them across your stakeholders. A lot of business leaders are well intentioned. Ninety-two percent of populations in recent reports we’ve done say they want their employers to promote an economy that serves all people, stakeholders, and is more holistic. Many CEOs repeat that with their purpose narrative. But it’s then connecting that responsible social cooperation to the actual outcomes for stakeholders and outcomes for their performance that’s hard.', 'Secondly, you earn trust over time. It’s one of those things that can be eroded in a moment but takes a long time to build. Part of that is competence and resiliency around what you do as a corporation, being reliable as an employer in your commitments to various stakeholders. But it’s also about intimacy, knowing them well, having a way of staying in touch; you would call it “sentiment analysis” if you are powering it with AI in modern language. How do you stay close to and genuinely informed by the probably competing interests of your different stakeholders? You have to know them well enough so you can authentically engage with them and meet their needs and do that underpinned by low self-orientation.', 'The business mindset is more humble now than it’s ever been, and that is a good thing. Once stakeholders believe that business leaders are trying to solve the problems genuinely with their competing interests in mind, they’ll be more confident and more trusting of business leaders. So while I’m encouraged by the recent Edelman Trust Barometer that launched at the virtual Davos Agenda, and Paul, you will have seen that, that listed your supervisor or your business manager as one of the most trusted sources. One, it’s a caution for governments and other sources that they need to build trust. But two, it’s a responsibility that I think now more than ever businesses have to take seriously.', 'Once stakeholders believe that business leaders are trying to solve the problems genuinely with their competing interests in mind, they’ll be more confident and more trusting of business leaders.', 'Diane Brady: That’s true, the trust barometer did look very hopeful for CEOs this year. Paul, I was reminded when you mentioned white blood cells, that if I was to go to central casting and pick two leaders, you and Vivian are very much off script. You started out wanting to be a doctor when you grew up, did you not? Or a priest?', 'Paul Polman: Well, I started out wanting to be a priest until I discovered the limitations of that profession in the Catholic church. So then I moved to become a doctor. In the Netherlands, we have what we call numerous fixes where the government limits the number of places as the studies are being paid for. So unfortunately, when that didn’t work out. I had to find something else when my father made clear that I had to make a living. By serendipity I ended up in business and worked for three great companies: P&G [Procter & Gamble], then Nestlé, and then Unilever, all at the executive level.', 'So that was a tremendous experience. One of the things that I learned there is that all these companies have been around for 150 years or more. P&G started in 1837, Nestlé in 1866, as a coincidence, Unilever in the end of the 19th century. These are companies that are built to last. The question really is why? We’re trying, at least, to operate under this longer-term, multistakeholder model, which is, more importantly, strongly values based.', 'This comes back to the truth and trust. You build trust with truth, and truth is so often missing now from society, from the political level, from the media level, obviously exaggerated in the past few years. That’s why you’ve actually seen the trust go down. Yes, it is true that business comes out a little bit better, but if you look at the absolute levels of trust, we have a lot still to go for. It’s interesting, because what has changed over the past 50 years is that 50 years ago, you could look at a balance sheet and sort of decide what the value of a company is.', 'Today, 85 percent of a company’s value is in intangibles or goodwill, or in fact, it is trust or reputation. The value of a company now is created in trust and reputation. That means, “do what you say, say what you do.” That means working in a much more transparent environment. That also means being part of these broader partnerships or bigger transformations that make you a net-positive company. When I started the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, I put out 50 targets, three overarching targets on environmental and social, but 50 targets.', 'The value of a company now is created in trust and reputation. That means,  ‘do what you say, say what you do.’  That means working in a much more transparent environment.', 'People said, “You’re totally nuts to put out 50 targets.” But the whole idea there was to create that transparency that was actually building trust. It served us well. It’s regrettable to me that even today, 12 or 13 years later, we’re still the only company that has done two human-rights reports, a report on child labor and slavery. We were not shy in that creating of trust to be transparent about the toughest challenges that we have in our business models.', 'Diane Brady: I do think the background as well makes a difference with the mindset. Vivian, what did you want to be when you grew up? I don’t believe CEO was your initial passion that drove you to where you are today.', 'Vivian Hunt: Oftentimes when you’re older in your life and more experienced, you apply language and logic to yourself as a child that probably didn’t exist when you were younger. So in my case, my parents were just very committed to service, high-quality education, and being of service to your family and to society. Those were the governing principles. My mom was a primary school teacher, and my father was in the military, and then later he became a pastor or a priest. Paul, my dad eventually ended his career as a priest, so you may still have another chapter ahead of you.', 'Paul Polman: My mom was a teacher as well in primary school, so we have that in common.', 'Vivian Hunt: It’s that notion of service, and it was very present in the work that they chose to do, and how they chose to take something that might’ve been restrictive for them. My father, although he had a college education, he was an African American male coming out of school in the early ’60s to a very segregated and polarized society that didn’t have any of the inclusive norms that we talk about today.', 'Going into the military was one of the few options he had to put his education to good use. But he turned that into a real example and a positive one. This notion of service was one really big concept. Secondly, recognizing that your life, literally your existence, is a function of the cumulative contributions and sacrifices that others have made before you. That can be something as simple as voting-rights legislation. It’s very easy to see how those campaigns and battles for justice have created rights and entitlements for people all over the world, all the way through to the clothes you’re wearing, the things you buy, the luxuries we enjoy today.', 'So when I first got out of university, I went into the Peace Corps. I became a sage-femme or a midwife in West Africa, partly just to make a change from what I had done before, partly to live and work deeply in a culture that was predominantly African or Caribbean culture, to live and work in a culture that was intrinsically of my heritage, and third, probably just to get away from my parents. All the things you do as a 21-year-old. It really turned me on to the importance and foundational nature of healthcare, which is a big economic driver and foundational to all of our health, and secondly, to the concept of service. Those are the things that really shaped me then and now.', 'Diane Brady: Paul, let me turn to you, because you’re now taking your experiences and conveying them both at the policy level but also with other leaders who want to put this into practice. What advice do you have for somebody at the company level in terms of implementing this?', 'Paul Polman: Well, in terms of implementing it, the reason I created IMAGINE was that, broadly, many of the people are aware of the direction we need to go and the issues we need to attack: food security, climate change, poverty, inequality, et cetera. But, unfortunately, it is all change within a current system, which leads to incrementalism and not the step changes that we need. We need to be bolder and braver in what we do. In a society where still there are a lot of skeptics and cynics, where change is undoubtedly difficult, you first have to work on that inner core. Then you have to work on the external side, or the outer core. That truly starts by realizing that it’s not about yourself.', 'We need to be bolder and braver in what we do. In a society where still there are a lot of skeptics and cynics, where change is undoubtedly difficult, you first have to work on that inner core.', 'The moment you realize that by investing in others and putting them ahead of your own, you’re actually better off yourself as well, is the moment that you hit a sweet spot in leadership. We need to get more comfortable working with the different sectors of society, civil society, and governments, together with business, because these issues have such magnitude now that nobody can solve them alone. We need to have different contracts with society, both shorter term and longer term, and create these partnerships that at times might be a little bit uncomfortable but are the only way to drive these systemic changes. We’ve realized that the CEOs themselves might have some limitations inherently built into their jobs or the current structures, so our theory of change, very simply, is to work collectively to drive home these broader system changes that individual companies cannot do alone.', 'Vivian Hunt: I like the idea of bravery as a leader, which isn’t irrational, it’s just showing courage in the face of the decisions and choices that you have. You look at Dan Schulman when he went into PayPal and made the decision to review their pay standards, increase the benefits, add shareholding. So it’s shared ownership and incentives and outcomes as a conscious investment and decision.', 'There’s no question it has unleashed an engagement, commitment, and enthusiasm from his employees but also helped with other parts of the system. Any time a leader goes into a new role, just think about when you’ve been promoted or changed jobs, or when you have a new opportunity. It’s an opportunity to ask yourself, how can I embed my own purpose, my own narrative, into the role that I now have, with this moment?', 'Some people are dreaming of becoming a manager, dreaming of becoming CEO, dreaming of leading an organization in some way. But when you have that opportunity, there is a moment of reflection that you should have to pause and consult and ask yourself, how can I make sure that I feel authentic and genuinely motivated by what we’re asked to do here? That’s what I’m going to stand up and advocate for, with all the challenges and contradictions and difficulty that probably lie ahead for most of us as business leaders, in a way that’s authentic and meaningful for me personally, as well as for the company. That pause for what’s the opportunity for me to make a bigger difference, and how could I add to or change my leadership model, particularly when you’re changing roles or starting something new, is a really important moment for a lot of leaders.', 'Paul Polman: And don’t you feel, Vivian, that COVID-19 has given a lot of people that pause to reflect a little bit more on their own purpose and the higher order for businesses to start to strive for? I feel relatively positive about that, that many have used that pause for good.', 'Vivian Hunt: I agree with you, Paul. Once you add that empathy, clarity of communication, and iterative problem solving, system problem solving with your stakeholders, with your employees, with your shareholders, particularly powered by the transparency that AI and data are providing us. Once you start and commit to that level of engagement and communication, you can’t stop, right? Once you’ve engaged your supply chain in a more transparent way, or once you’ve shared, in your case, those 50 goals, or a broader set of objectives beyond economics, I don’t think CEOs and companies have the option to go back to the way we were.', 'The word “transform” means to change in a way that you can’t go back to the way you were before. I feel like 2020 was that kind of moment, because even the language we’re using to describe the impact that business can have on the world has changed. I think and I hope it’s a permanent change in how leaders are thinking of themselves and what their organizations can do.', 'Diane Brady: Now, if I’m a shareholder, and I go back to that, I guess it’s Milton Friedman’s doctrine of the social responsibility of business to increase profits, how does this affect my faith in leaders’ abilities to deliver on how I might measure success in a company? Paul?', 'Paul Polman: Well, there are two things. I always say that Adam Smith wrote this book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 17 years before he wrote The Wealth of Nations. Even if Milton Friedman would be around today, I don’t think that he would write the same thing for which he got rewarded the Nobel Prize. I really think that he would be advocating the multistakeholder, longer-term model of value creation. Don’t forget that the issues, when he wrote that, were quite different.', 'The organizations were set up quite differently. The financial market was quite different. There was a higher level of involvement of the shareholders. Businesses were more local and were forced to be linked to their local communities. They had a human face. So Milton Friedman, which is now over 50 years ago, should not be judged by today’s standards. And I don’t think he would have the same opinions.', 'If you believe in shareholder primacy, then there is one thing that has definitely happened over the past ten years, something that I probably did not have as much of a benefit from when I started the Unilever journey, but was convinced about, which is that we can now show with hard facts that a more diverse organization—or an organization that has built more resilience in its value chain, or an organization that pays its people decent wages, or an organization that internalizes the challenges of climate change—we’re now able to show that they’re also resulting in overwhelmingly higher returns.', 'There obviously are the standard factors of having a good strategy and hiring the right people, and broadly we see that now. The financial market is catching on as well. Unlike the financial crisis, as I mentioned, ten years ago, in 2020 a lot of people are saying, “Oh, this whole area of ESG [environmental, social, and governance] will go in reverse.” It’s actually the opposite. If there’s one lesson that we’ve learned, it’s that it actually has accelerated, that more businesses have put purpose at the core in starting this transformation. Regarding social and environmental issues, people now understand this interconnectedness that Vivian talked about, and that you can’t have healthy people on an unhealthy planet.', 'There’s a whole new generation now evolving faster than I had expected myself that is calling out. There is now a Greta Thunberg in every organization. They’re walking out if you’re not aggressive enough on climate change, if you sent mattresses to the borders where parents are separated from their children. If your company works on face recognition with the government and people feel that’s an intrusion, if you don’t fight for the rights of LGBTs or other minorities, people are increasingly speaking up. There is a movement for change in society that is probably bigger than we realize, in very tough external conditions with COVID-19 that, as we come out and start to rebuild these economies, we will benefit from.', 'The final thing that I think COVID-19 has shown us is we have now spent $13 trillion, $14 trillion to just save lives and livelihoods, and frankly, all that money has been spent because of the failure of us to act earlier. It has also shown us that the cost of not acting now is significantly higher than the cost of acting. If you turn that positively, businesses that understand that are probably sitting on the biggest business opportunity that you have. Greening our society moving forward, retrofitting buildings, moving to green energy, mobility-system electrifying, and restoring our natural capital, all these things are high multipliers on investment return.', 'They also create more jobs; they create better jobs. Businesses that position themselves in that direction will be rewarded. The peak of that thing you saw last year happening was Tesla, which shot up in value to the same market cap as all the other companies combined in the car industries. The same is happening in many other industries. We’re sitting on the crest of a revolution of a scale and magnitude we’ve never seen before.', 'Vivian Hunt: Even if you look over the longer term, those same patterns show. When we look at our long-term data sets across countries for value creation, companies that have performed better, have had multiple goals, are more holistic in those outcomes, they’re broader in terms of the metrics that they measure.', 'That’s both at the investor level as well as the operational level. That’s every country as well as every sector. So whether you look at the near-term recent examples, or you look over the longer five-, ten-, 15-year cycle of value creation, companies that have a broader diversity of goals and objectives and have fulfilled those in sustainable ways do find higher returns.', 'You have to have the confidence as a leadership team that you can have a clear strategy, a deep understanding of your stakeholders, sustain and manage that over time, manage the risks and the downsides. A lot of us are afraid of making mistakes, particularly when there’s increased transparency. Instead of engaging with stakeholders, we shy away from them. So it takes really good architecture for what your strategy is, really good architecture of performance metrics and outcomes contingency so that you are able to make some mistakes, able to change course.', 'You’ll see that those more diverse investments do result in higher returns. Whether it’s in the near term, powered by technology and innovation, or the long-term data sets that we see in the McKinsey Global Institute, they’re both correlated with a more holistic, broader defense of stakeholder capitalism.', 'Diane Brady: Vivian, what’s the role of the board? Because we’ve talked a lot about the stakeholders externally. Any thoughts as to how both the relationship with the board, the makeup of the board, has to change in this environment?', 'Vivian Hunt: We try to give boards and executive teams courage so that they can take the sometimes difficult decisions that they need to take. In a sense, a board’s responsibility is to provide an external and internal balance and challenge and support for an executive team. The board itself has to represent a diverse range of views and stakeholders, and that’s why sometimes the most effective boards are ones that have ways to systematically include the input of different stakeholders through their committee structure and outcomes.', 'But at the end of the day, if their annual report is about financial returns only, their aperture is probably too narrow. We’d argue that, first, taking this broader definition of what the company is solving for and having that very clear in the purpose of the company and what the impact report or the annual impact report speaks to so that the board—both in its composition and inputs that inform the company strategy and decision, and also how it counsels and supports the executives—reflects those diversity of views.', 'The evidence doesn’t suggest that that’s inconsistent with a strong performance in outcomes. When you look at Unilever or Patagonia or PayPal or Salesforce, many companies in many different sectors that we could name, it is a diversity of goals, endorsed by the board, that leads them in the right direction. There’s a lot boards can do in terms of the governance model. But the action, if you will, the activation takes place at the executive level.', 'Paul Polman: If I can build on that, I could not stress [enough] the importance of a diversified board. One of the things we did at Unilever right away was 50-50 in terms of gender diversity. We had two people from Africa, we had two people from China. We made it an absolutely global board, but more importantly, also in competence. What you now see is that most of the CEOs will say the short-term pressure comes from the boards. We still see a misalignment between incentive systems and executive pay, and what this broader, multistakeholder business model requires.', 'Recent studies would show that only 7 percent of board people are climate competent and 17 percent have ESG knowledge. Then if you look at the turnover in CEOs, where the average tenure is only four and a half years now, this is clearly not enough to address these issues. The board there has a job to do. In the board practices that we work with, and the boards that we discuss with, it often is mentioned that, “Yeah, but if I take more responsibilities in my fiduciary duties than the shareholder alone, I might take too much risk on my plate.”', 'And I would only say here that the opposite is actually true. If you are a board right now and you are not calculating in the other risks or opportunities that are around the planetary boundaries, the social equations that we’ve talked about, you probably are starting to take more risk on yourself as a board member instead of less. We significantly need to transform the boards. Too many have interpreted it too narrowly as being a fiduciary duty to shareholder primacy.', 'If you actually go back to the spirit or letter of the law in most of the jurisdictions, it had a different intention. So to bring that back and provide that breathing space—also for CEOs to become brave and bold, as we talked about—is a very important thing that needs to be addressed.', 'The second thing that needs to be addressed is that we need to measure what we treasure. Our accounting system is basically a return on financial capital. We need to start looking at our accounting systems to also include the return on environmental and social capital. There is a major effort going on now with the IFRS Foundation. They got over 600 responses, overwhelmingly obviously around climate change, but also around other areas, especially the social part, of why we need to force companies to disclose more and start to measure that and be able to compare.', 'It is very clear that companies that report are making more progress. They’re also probably better leaders and more responsible. So getting our accounting systems to change their measurements is an important second thing we need to work on.', 'Vivian Hunt: It also then helps companies clarify which aspect of the outcomes they’re solving for can they influence as a company, and maybe to the advantage of their customers, employees, shareholders, and which things do they need to work on collectively with other parts of their supply chain in the industry, and/or with governments.', 'Because if you’re not measuring the outcomes you’re trying to solve—if you need different regulatory parameters or different technology investments, or different skill development of your workforce investments that you can contribute to as a company, but you alone probably can’t solve, particularly if you’ve got multiple goals—it helps clarify the areas where you really want to push on something for differentiation so a customer or an employee chooses you.', 'That is versus the areas where collectively the industry might have some incentives to change the regulatory frame or innovate new ways of working. I just want to come back to this point about boards. The representativeness, in terms of intrinsic characteristics, gender, culture, et cetera, is very important.', 'The skill set point that Paul made is just as important: technology skills, environmental savvy, experience understanding and monitoring sentiment, coaching skills for the executive, clear sets of diverse goals in addition to their financial stewardship, and then measuring the right things so that you give the executive the room, the playing field on which they can then be successful. If boards and investors don’t give companies and investors that permission, it’s very hard for a leader to really act against this agenda and reach its full potential.', 'Diane Brady: One of the things I’d like to address with both of you is talking about the realities and opportunities of the pandemic. Working women, for example, have gone backward to some extent, as we’ve tried to balance homeschooling, taking care of children, being fully there for our jobs on Zoom calls, and such.', 'We’ve seen the achievement gap widen when it comes to the impact on people of color, both with employment, schooling, et cetera. What message do we have, and how do we address some of these real social costs that we’ve seen?', 'Vivian Hunt: Well, I would hope that we would not only want to get back to where we were before the pandemic, but actually improve on that. We know in the last couple of recessions there have not been an improved economic or balanced set of outcomes for historically underrepresented groups in the workplace. You mentioned women, or ethnic minorities in some cultures. But it’s also true with climate goals. We didn’t add anything to make it significantly better. The push for a more green and a more inclusive recovery needs to be explicitly built in to how companies are responding.', 'When we get to a point where the miraculous delivery of the vaccines are at scale in both developed as well as developing economies, and we feel confident communicating, moving around, and interconnecting the way we normally do for business and society to operate, we have to explicitly be able to demonstrate how the company is more green, how it is more inclusive. I mean that not only in terms of gender and ethnic representation, but inclusive in terms of skills and its operating practices. And then finally, more interconnected, better use of the data and platforms that are driving, and AI platforms that are connecting us and making the business system increasingly transparent.', 'I wouldn’t say we want to build back the same. We have to build back better than we were, meaning more green, more inclusive, more connected. Businesses should be explicit about the initiatives they’re doing in their portfolio, their strategy, their people, and culture, purchasing systems, metrics about how they’re adding those things in as we collectively come out of the COVID-19 crisis.', 'Paul Polman: I could not agree more. It wasn’t working before. I don’t think we have to be polite about that. Gender equality was taking us 257 years before the crisis. Inequality was going up in every country in the world. Climate change was on the curve to get to well above 3.5°C. It was an absolute disaster that led to the COVID-19 crisis in the first place. By the way, the COVID-19 crisis should not come as a surprise. We’ve had Ebola, we have Zika, and we had SARS.', 'We get pandemics every five to ten years. Unfortunately, increasingly so, as we destroy Mother Nature and invite these zoonotic diseases in. It cannot go back to where we came from. The first priority has to be to contain and eradicate the fires. That’s not done, by any means. The trade-off between lives and livelihoods that some people keep advocating is, in my opinion, a false dilemma. The second priority is that we have to create the conditions for a broad recovery. And that requires international cooperation.', 'Most of the institutions have failed us. Also during COVID-19, we saw countries putting out export barriers. We saw a disregard for the needs of the developing markets in many different senses. The sense of cooperation of the multilateral institutions needs to be restored if we want to build back better, as Vivian says.', 'The third priority is to really be sure that we have a new narrative of economic growth, where a more sustainable, a more equitable, a more inclusive economic growth is, in fact, the one that creates the jobs, the social cohesion, and obviously where we can live in harmony with planet Earth, now and for generations to come. That narrative is becoming increasingly attractive. The biggest hurdle that we now have will be a further risk of lack of social cohesion. We’ve seen unemployment go up to the tune of 500 million jobs lost. Many of them are artificially propped up right now with government spending that will run out.', 'Again, it’s the people who are already suffering from many of the other things who pay a price here as well, young people and women. So if we don’t create the jobs, and if we don’t make this a more inclusive growth, then the issues of social cohesion are going to be the biggest ones that we have to deal with. We have to invest significantly more than we’ve invested to deal with the crisis itself. That’s a challenge, because governments, and especially you see that now in Europe, are not as eager to spend more money after they’ve spent these enormous amounts already in the past year alone.', 'And yet, it is absolutely needed to have a Keynesian sort of globally coordinated spending plan to create these jobs. The good thing is that a greener economy creates more jobs. We’ve looked at this implementation of the sustainable development goals around the areas of mobility, food, and land use; health and well-being; and cities. We found an opportunity of $12 trillion and 380 million jobs at a time when we need that most. This year is going to be a very important year, because we have the UN Food Systems Summit, we have the UN Climate Change Conference, we have the UN Biodiversity Conference.', 'These are moments now that the countries of this world can make major commitments to help create this framework, and then for businesses, obviously, to follow through. Because ultimately the financing, the innovations, the ideas have to come from the private sector. But it will only work if the governments put the right frameworks in place. The good thing is, I’m relatively optimistic, because the stars are aligned now with the change in administration in the US. Let’s not mince words around that. We have eight to ten of the biggest economies in the world making climate commitments, for example, to be net zero by 2050. Those are major changes now that we need to follow through with concrete action and policy changes. This year is going to be crucial for that.', 'Vivian Hunt: You know, it’s very easy to look at problems that have to be addressed in a systemic way—the quality of the education system, the skills required, the environmental formula—and believe that it’s too big a problem. It’s outside my ability to influence as a single company.', 'But you might choose one or two areas and work on those collaboratively with members of your industry and of your supply chain. But within your company, there’s a lot you can do to benchmark your responsible social practices as a corporation.', 'Link them in value-creation terms, economically as well as other types of value in outcomes, and use your skills in differentiation to deliver well for your company and deliver well for your stakeholders. But if you can’t make it specific so that your employees and your managers understand it, it’s going to be hard for them to deliver.', 'Diane Brady: There are many people listening, I’m sure, who perhaps want to be leaders, maybe they are starting out in their careers, and this can be a period in which you feel impotent in the face of all these challenges. Any advice on a personal level that you would give to them? Paul, I’ll start with you.', 'Paul Polman: Oh, it’s always difficult to generalize there. But I’m very optimistic about the young people. Fifty percent of the world population is under 30 years old. And they’re very creative, they’re purpose driven.', 'I would also stress the power of values, integrity, humility, and humanity to restore trust values is going to be very important. Try to be a leader like that. The power of partnership we talked about to make a difference and to address some of these issues requires us to work differently. Younger people, again, are better qualified for that. But above all, the power of purpose, the passion of finding yourself is what gives you passion, perhaps. But purpose is about losing yourself to the service of others.', 'I think I’ve realized, as Vivian has, that we’ve just been outright lucky. When I was born in the Netherlands, I didn’t have to worry about access to a piece of bar soap, so I made it past the age of five. I had food, so I didn’t have stunting or food security issues. My government paid for education, which my parents could not afford to give their six children. That’s why I’m talking to you. But at the end of the day, I won the lottery ticket of life. I didn’t do anything for this. And if you won the lottery ticket of life, then you only belong to about 5 percent of the world population, unfortunately, even today.', 'Then it’s your duty to put yourself to the service of the other 95 percent. The more we do that, the better off we’ll be—all of us. It was the Dalai Lama who said that if you seek enlightenment for yourself, simply to enhance yourself and your position, you miss the purpose. But if you seek enlightenment for yourself to enable you to serve others, you are its purpose. My simple message is, lead a life with purpose.', 'Diane Brady: Vivian, any thoughts?', 'Vivian Hunt: Paul characterized so well the principles of servant leadership, which is how I would reflect on it. The notion of leading, having something that you’re passionate and excited about, that you want to do and that you want to contribute to—and by the way, that’s no less important at age 16 than it is 66 or 106—but that you’ve got real energy and excitement for, that you’re doing that in a way that’s of service to the organizations that you work with, whether they’re in the private sector or the public sector.', 'If you do that—real passion, real expertise, real contribution in service to the business, in service to others—you won’t go wrong. I would also say have high ambitions. It’s easy to imagine a world that is different than today. But if you think things are fixed, that we can’t change, that the economic pie isn’t big enough for us to share and distribute in different ways, that we’ve got to compete over finite resources, then you end up in quite a reductionist and small mindset.', 'So this aspiration of collectively growing our impact economically, socially, and in many other aspects of our rights and responsibilities, all of the enablers, then the pie is big enough to share. High ambition really does matter. Not in an egotistical, self-driven way, or an individualistic way, but having high ambition that society can be different and better. That probably is one of the most exciting things that I hear from talking to my teenagers and the younger generation.', 'The final thing is to recognize that it takes real work. The things we’re talking about are not lofty ideas on a shelf; they’re things that real people and real companies have done in collaboration with others and governments. You’ve got to put your shoulder to the wheel. Learn something with excellence, collaborate with others who have integrity and real skills, and really work with other stakeholders to change things. That’s not easy. Paul and I can talk about different things, and you’ve gone along the journey.', 'We could probably fill the whole podcast with disappointments that we’ve had over our careers and lives. So don’t think that it’s going to be linear. The arc of history bends toward justice, but it doesn’t mean that it’s going to go in a straight line. We’re in a period where we’ve got to straighten up our backs and realize that we have our focus on these more holistic outcomes as businesspeople, as well as citizens more generally. Hopefully that’s encouraging to young people, as well as some of us who are a little bit older.', 'Diane Brady: I cannot think of a better place to end than there. Dame Vivian Hunt, I know you are working with leaders worldwide to promote these issues and deal with these tough challenges. Thanks very much for joining us.', 'Vivian Hunt: Thank you, Diane. Thank you, Paul.', 'Diane Brady: And Paul, who is a pioneer in multistakeholder capitalism at Unilever, now helping leaders do the same at IMAGINE, and other realms.

29,The boss factor,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-boss-factor,"How you get along with your manager can shape your health, happiness, and productivity.","['How you get along with your manager can shape your health, happiness, and productivity.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with McKinsey’s Tera Allas about her research into the impact that your relationship with your boss has on satisfaction on the job and in life. An edited version of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Every business wants to do well, both in society and, of course, in its bottom line. And one of the most important factors, it turns out, is the boss factor. What is it? Tera Allas, the director of research and economics in McKinsey’s UK and Ireland office, is here to tell us. Welcome, Tera.', 'Tera Allas: Hi, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: So what is the boss factor?', 'Tera Allas: The boss factor is the fact that bosses have an enormous influence on workers’ well-being through their relationships. And it turns out that people’s job satisfaction has an enormous influence on their overall life satisfaction. Things like health and mental health are obviously important for whether somebody’s happy in their lives. After that, the second most important thing is whether they’re happy in their job. And there, the most important factor is their relationship with their boss. Bosses have a huge influence—not just on the financial performance of businesses but also on the  well-being of the workers, and hence, the business’s societal impact.', 'Diane Brady: What prompted you to look at this right now?', 'Tera Allas: We started looking at measures beyond shareholder value and GDP [gross domestic product, a measure of the economic output of a country] a while back. When you look at those factors, you come across measurements of life satisfaction. And when you look at the data, you quickly realize that bosses are very important.', 'There’s this paradox. On one hand, your relationship with your boss is by far the most important thing  in terms of your job satisfaction. But more than  70 percent of people say that spending time with their boss is the most stressful time of the entire working week. There is clearly room for improvement here.', 'Diane Brady: I’m surprised at how high the number is in terms of the dissatisfaction.', 'Tera Allas: There are a lot of very good bosses, and then there are a lot of very bad bosses. And even the very good bosses don’t necessarily realize that their impact on the people who work with them goes well beyond the business. The impact [bosses have] inside the workplace actually bleeds into a person’s overall life satisfaction. And there are organizations in which you tend to see some concentrations of good and bad bosses.', 'For example, if you have good bosses, then  you’re more likely to be a good boss yourself.  That’s because you see that as the role model  and recognize that that’s what is expected and appreciated in your firm. You also personally  feel the effects of having a nice boss, a boss  who empathizes with you and cares about you  as a person.', 'Diane Brady: Do you think that the pandemic  has exacerbated the tensions that we have with our boss?', 'Tera Allas: That’s a really interesting question. The evidence to date is mixed. In some ways it depends both on the employee and the boss, and the boss’s style. Before I even get into that, we should remember that around 60 percent of all people— in the US and also in most developed economies—can’t actually work remotely.', 'So it’s really only the 40 percent who could even,  in theory, work from home—office workers and knowledge workers. The 60 percent who can’t work from home are people like dentists, or bus drivers,  or beauticians, or similar.', 'We shouldn’t leave anyone out of the equation, but just among office workers, there seem to be a lot of different segments. Certain individuals seem to take to remote working really well; it improves their well-being and their productivity. Others find it a struggle, whether for personal reasons or because their environment is not ideal.', 'Certain bosses are very good at maintaining and building relationships even when that relationship is remote, when you can only communicate by phone or by videoconferencing. Other bosses are really bad at maintaining relationships in general, which is probably made worse by trying to manage remotely. So I don’t think there’s a universal, single experience that people are having.', 'Some recent research that is quite intriguing indicates that many people who’ve started to work from home are finding it somewhat liberating. They feel that they have a little bit more autonomy. We know from previous research that autonomy is an incredibly important part of feeling satisfied with your own job—feeling that you have some say over how things get done, when they get done, and that you’re trusted and empowered to get it done. So I suspect there will be people who are actually feeling quite good about their current situation.', 'Diane Brady: So if your boss is not quite as powerful in your life as before, that would make you happier?', 'Tera Allas: I think it’s not necessarily about how powerful they are but also what their attitude is. Obviously, for a remote-working relationship to work well, there needs to be trust. The employee needs to do the work.', 'Perhaps more bosses have realized that, in this pandemic, the only way they’re going to have an effective team that still continues to deliver, despite enormous pressures from inside and outside of the business, is by building trust and by putting extra effort into spending time with people to really connect with them. Otherwise, there would be real concerns about burnout and people not being able to draw boundaries between work and home when they’re working from home.', 'Really good bosses listen to all that information  and change the way they behave, perhaps enabling a much more independent way of working. You  can’t just tell people to work independently; you  also have to change processes, such as how you’re meeting, how you’re communicating, to make that possible. For the boss, that can mean quite a bit of effort. But many bosses who have made those changes find that it’s worth the investment because the team is not only happier with how they’re working but also more effective. And it’s less work for the boss if they’re not micromanaging.', 'Diane Brady: When I hear the term “servant leader,” it strikes me that the qualities that propel one to be a leader are not necessarily the qualities that make for a good boss.', 'Tera Allas: That’s exactly right. The research that we looked at suggests that the characteristics that tend to get you promoted are not necessarily the kind of characteristics that might go with being a good servant leader. Now, of course, there’s a middle way. And there are people who have both. But generally speaking, people who tend to get promoted are quite self-centered and very focused on their individual performance. They are also very good at articulating their own point of view and, therefore, perhaps not what servant leaders really do. Servant leaders provide a platform for their employees to provide their best work—really praising them and supporting them, rather than elevating themselves. Now, there are organizations which are starting to really look at those promotion and cultural issues  to make sure that it is the servant leaders that get promoted. But those organizations are still few and far between.', 'Diane Brady: What can one do to be a better boss?', 'Tera Allas: The first thing is just caring—caring about your employees, asking them how they’re doing, and actually wanting to know what they say. Then engaging with them on that level. And if they’re feeling terrible, trying to understand why.', 'It’s a bit like being a parent. There isn’t the right or wrong way to respond. But you do want to be nonjudgmental and empathetic to understand what’s going on.', 'It’s a bit like being a parent. There isn’t the right  or wrong way to respond. But you do want to be nonjudgmental and empathetic to understand what’s going on with that person, and how you might be able to help or how, together, you might be able  to solve that problem.', 'That is enormously important for building trust and building this concept of psychological safety—where people feel safe to be innovative, to raise issues when the business is not going great, to come up with new ideas, to be change-ready. Empathy is really critical. The other thing that I’ve practiced myself is just thanking people for everything all the time. Even if it’s something quite small that they did, they deserve thanks for it—even if it’s something that’s part of their job.', 'Why not thank them? First of all, I am thankful. Second of all, it costs me absolutely nothing. Third, it makes that person feel better. There’s a lot of research suggesting that celebrating really small steps is critical to people reaching big goals. I think it is an important way of buoying and enhancing well-being, satisfaction, and happiness in the team.', 'There’s a lot of research suggesting that celebrating really small steps is critical to people reaching big goals. I think it is an important way of buoying and enhancing well-being.', 'To do these things well, to do them from the heart rather than from just the head, requires that the leader have some self-knowledge as well. They recognize the importance of that emotional connection with their workers.', 'That’s not easy for everyone. I think managers and leaders can do a lot of things just in terms of building their self-awareness, whether it’s signing up with a coach, taking some time for reflection, or asking for feedback. All those things will help them in their role as a leader. It might make them a bit more humble, and therefore allow them to better observe what impact they have on the people around them.', 'Diane Brady: Did you notice any particular differences in terms of demographics or geographic differences?', 'Tera Allas: Once you correct for basic features like income levels and so on, there are surprisingly few differences—whether it is between different ages, different geographies, or different genders. To me, this speaks to the universality of the boss factor.', 'In some ways, it doesn’t surprise me. The world is ultimately made up of people, and people ultimately thrive on relationships. That’s really important for how they feel about themselves and how well they’re then able to perform. And so, in some ways, you would expect this to be the case across all kinds of businesses.', 'Where we did see some differences was by sector.  I talked earlier on about this idea that the more autonomous people feel and the more trusted they feel to get on with their work, the more empowered and happier they are not only in their jobs but also in their lives.', 'There are many sectors—particularly professional services and creative industries—where people can have those kinds of roles. But there are also quite a few sectors where people do not feel that they can do their jobs autonomously, where the culture is a little bit more top-down command and control. I suspect that if we were able to dig deeper into that, we would find that, even in those sectors, there’s some businesses that are able to bring much more of that kind of autonomy to bear.', 'It doesn’t really take much. Even if you’re, say, in a manufacturing setting, one of the things you can do is have a five-minute meeting at the beginning of every shift to say, “How is everybody? Do you have any ideas about how we could improve what we’re doing today?”', 'Obviously, you can always start doing that once you’ve already built some trust with your workers, but if you create that culture and environment of soliciting ideas bottom-up, and giving people a sense that they own a lot of what happens in the team and in the factory or in the workplace that you’re talking about, then you can do it in pretty much any sector.', 'Diane Brady: I’m intrigued by how this ties back to success.', 'Tera Allas: There’s now a lot of research showing that happier employees are more productive, more engaged, and more loyal. They generate better customer loyalty and are less likely to leave. All of these positive feedback loops mean that it’s a win–win. And then looking at the data, it was just so stark, this impact that the bosses have: that the vast majority of somebody’s job satisfaction is really about how they perceive their relationship with their boss. You would think that it could be things like pay or how exciting or interesting or important their job is. But actually, the biggest impact is from their relationship with their boss, even if what they’re doing is a pretty mundane job.', 'So that got us thinking that there’s something missing in the ESG [environmental, social, and governance] debate. People are looking outside. They’re looking to how you can help the community, or how you can help your supply chains, or how you can reduce your environmental footprint. But the truth is that by looking inside, and looking at the often thousands of people that large companies employ, you could actually make a huge contribution to society by just making sure that those people are better off from a well-being perspective, that they’re more satisfied with their lives because they’re more satisfied with their jobs.', 'Diane Brady: Should this alter how we think about promoting people?', 'Tera Allas: Definitely. Promotion and other kinds of recognition send a powerful signal to everybody who works at an organization. It’s a powerful way of essentially changing behaviors. If you don’t change who you promote, then you might be saying with your words that you would like your organization to be an inclusive one that looks after the well-being of employees. But if that’s not backed up by actual actions when it comes to promoting people—if you promote people who are superstars in terms of delivering, say, customer accounts and sales but who actually treat their people badly—then you’re sending a very conflicting signal.', 'Actions speak louder than words. You have  to change how you praise and promote people,  how you appraise them. When everybody has  their performance reviews, what gets looked at and emphasized?', 'You also need the bosses at the very top—the executive cadre—in their day-to-day experience with the people who they work with, to be showing and exhibiting these traits. Then the people who are looking up to the role models at the top of the organization can recognize that this is important, that they mean it when they say it.', 'Diane Brady: What is the advice you have for leaders to get to a place where they can even start to be better bosses?', 'Tera Allas: That’s an incredibly important question, and even though it sounds easy, it’s not necessarily easy. And part of that is because an awful lot of us haven’t gotten used to, or haven’t been taught to, bring our emotions and our whole self to work. And  if you’ve done something that’s made you fairly successful, that has excluded that [emotional] dimension of you, then relearning and reopening  up to that dimension takes a bit of time.', 'I would say there are two different approaches, and you may want to do both in parallel. The first one, of course, is that there are many training courses and coaches that can help you with that kind of unfreezing of how you think about yourself in the workplace, and how you think about your success, and how you think about the value you create. An enormous amount of value that you can create is by just being really nice to the people you work with because that makes their lives better. And what is more important than making people’s lives better? And as a bottom-line impact, as a bonus, you’ll also get better performance from the team. So there’s that kind of unfreezing, opening up, maybe by using coaching or training or, in some cases, even things like meditation or self-exploration.', 'But the other thing I have found is that, in some cases, just fake it till you make it. So, with something like thanking everybody, I would basically challenge everyone to ask, “Do you really not want to thank them?” I think everybody could find one or two things to thank everybody on their team about every day in a way that is sincere. The beauty of the fake-it-till-you-make-it approach is that, when you start seeing the positive effects that it has on people and their energy levels and their joy at work, you want to do more of it. Then suddenly it’s not faking anymore. You’re actually just doing it because you want to do it, because you can see and feel the benefits yourself. So I think every leader and every boss will perhaps want to take their own approach to this.', 'Think about what makes you feel safe, or in a place of psychological safety, so you feel able to take those steps. And then think also about what are some of the really small things you could start doing today that can build up to a workplace where people feel appreciated, and they feel trusted, and they feel that their boss is in their corner.', 'Diane Brady: Do you see a different kind of role for the boss going forward?', 'Tera Allas: I think COVID-19, and automation, and the future of work, all of these are pressures that are piling up on top of existing pressures. And in that sense, I see the importance of the role of the boss growing. So, yes, there’s going to be more change in the workplace.', 'That change is going to need to be handled by bosses who are sensitive to how they can support their workers to move into a different set of tasks or learn a new set of skills. Also, more and more of the jobs that we’re going to see humans do in the future, as opposed to machines—that can do lots of calculations and lots of automated tasks really well—are going to increasingly involve working with other humans, for example, in the customer interface or in the healthcare sector or public sector. The boss of the future will need to have excellent emotional intelligence to be able to not just command and control a team but actually support them to do what they, as the frontline workers, know is the best thing to do for any particular customer or any particular patient, say, in a hospital.', 'I think that’s going to be a bit of a revelation for certain types of leaders or managers, who’ve maybe grown up in a slightly more command-and-control environment. Once they move into a situation where they’re managing large groups of people—and not just people in a technocratic way but people in a people occupation—there will be many aspects that will come through, which will reinforce the things that we suggest around psychological safety, trust, and building those relationships, and really just helping people to have meaningful jobs that they look forward to coming to.', 'Diane Brady: We’ve talked a lot about the boss  and what they can do to be better. How can we, as individual team members, help our bosses be better? Since we seem to be unhappy according to the research that you’ve done, how can we basically make this situation more palatable?', 'Tera Allas: Not everybody’s unhappy, but there’s definitely room for improvement in most cases, in most organizations, and in most teams. It’s kind of the same thing in some ways but in reverse. It’s all about relationships. And how you build a good relationship with your employees is pretty much the same as how you would build a good relationship with your boss: accepting that they’re human. Understanding that they will occasionally be stressed out. Recognizing and empathizing with the pressures they’re under. And building that kind of trust-based communication that allows you to understand what’s going on with them, and perhaps invites them to ask what’s going on with you.', 'If you want to be empowered and you want to be given a role that’s autonomous, then you do need to show that you can be trusted. You need to be reliable. You need to do what you promised you would do and create a mutual recognition—and that, I think, would be a win–win, both for the boss and the employee.', 'Diane Brady: Very good advice. Thank you very much for joining us, Tera.', 'Tera Allas: Thank you, Diane. My pleasure.', 'Diane Brady: And thank you, all of you, who have tuned in.

Here’s how businesses can create a learning culture and invest in the capabilities that will help individuals and organizations thrive.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with Elizabeth Young McNally and Matthew Smith about how individuals and organizations can build skills and create a learning culture. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. We all think we can learn. But it’s more of an acquired skill than you think. And there is a reason why most company learning programs don’t work. Joining me today are two McKinsey partners who can tell us a lot about the fundamental and underappreciated skill of learning, not just how we improve that skill as individuals, but also how we nurture it in others, and how we create a real learning culture in our companies. Elizabeth Young McNally is a global leader of the McKinsey Academy out of Stamford, Connecticut. And Matthew Smith is McKinsey’s chief learning officer based in Paris. Liz and Matt, welcome.', 'Matthew Smith: Thanks, Diane.', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s start by talking a little bit about where you sit in this universe. Tell us what you do. Matt, I’ll start with you.', 'Matthew Smith: I am the chief learning officer here at McKinsey. What that means is I look after the learning and development of all of our 30,000-plus colleagues globally. That involves deeply understanding what the needs of our people are in terms of the capabilities they need to be successful, not only within McKinsey but also in their broader careers.', 'And then I turn that into a set of offerings that they can take advantage of—like leadership-development programs, internal and external courses—and make sure that we’re meeting those needs. That’s my job in a normal year.', 'In this very abnormal environment that we’re in now, where obviously many people are not able to go to in-person programs or attend live learning sessions, we’ve also been working very hard to ensure that all of our offerings are fit for the moment that we’re in. We’ve been doing a lot over this past year in particular to pivot much of what we do to digital and distance formats.', 'Diane Brady: I know from remote schooling that it’s a challenge to transfer to a digital environment. Before I go on to Liz, it sounds a little like you crowdsource programs. That’s not quite accurate, is it?', 'Matthew Smith: Well, I wouldn’t say we crowdsource. But we try to get the best of what’s offered externally and combine that with things that we create ourselves for our own people. I’ll give you an example. A skill like how to lead a McKinsey project team or how to solve problems in a very McKinsey-specific way, that’s not something that we can just source from the outside world.', 'It’s something we have to build for ourselves, for our own people. But, on the other hand, if we’re trying to teach people how to code in Python or the fundamentals of machine learning and artificial intelligence, there’s actually a lot of great material out there.', 'Over the past few years, there’s been just an explosion of external content available on sites like Coursera and Udemy and LinkedIn. We want to tap into that. We want to make sure that we offer our colleagues a mix of internally created programs for that very McKinsey-specific content, as well as the best of external content on skills that we don’t really need to reinvent the wheel on.', 'Diane Brady: Liz, let’s go to you. Talk about the McKinsey Academy and what drew you to that.', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: Sure. McKinsey Academy is our entity at the firm for building our clients’ capabilities. We help organizations achieve and sustain transformational impact by building the individual and organizational skills in areas that are required to sustain the transformations we do.', 'So, for example, if we’re serving a client on a digital transformation, we can embed McKinsey Academy offerings around the skills that those leaders will need to be able to lead and sustain that transformation. And similar to firm learning, it comes from the same core hybrid approach of blending together virtual programs, digital programs, reinforcements, field works, and other elements to enable our clients to acquire, apply, and sustain the skills that they will need.', 'Diane Brady: I’m intrigued. I was looking at your military background, which I often associate with leadership. Is that something that’s informed a little bit about how you approach the job?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: A hundred percent. I went to West Point, which is one of the world’s foremost, if not the foremost, leadership institution. The leadership lessons I learned in the military had a fundamental effect on me and how I serve clients and think about leadership development.', 'What I would add, though, is the military is not just a leadership organization. It’s fundamentally a learning and capability-building one as well. Look at how much time militaries spend on building skills. Fundamentally, that is the bread and butter of what militaries do as well. And so it has prepared me for this role, not just from the leadership angle, but also for an appreciation of how important good capability building is.', 'Diane Brady: I’m a curious person. I ask a lot of questions. And ergo I think of myself as a good learner, but not necessarily so. Matt, what are the fundamental tenets of learning how to learn?', 'Matthew Smith: This is a topic I’m really passionate about. Because I think what you just said, Diane, “learning how to learn,” is a phrase that we don’t hear enough these days. There’s a lot of talk about the need for people to have a learning mindset or build new skills. But there’s not enough attention on the fact that learning itself is a skill.', 'Diane Brady: But we think we have it already, right?', 'Matthew Smith: We all think we have it. So we might say, “I’m a fast learner” or “I’m a slow learner” or “I learn in this way or that way.” But, actually, a lot of the underlying research—there are several strands of research—shows that people can actually build skills to learn new skills.', 'We think of this as one of the most fundamental capabilities that a person can develop for themselves. It makes you better at getting better at things. It makes you better able to adapt to the changing environment that we all face these days. This idea of learning as a skill, in and of itself, is a fundamental one, and one that we talk to a lot of our clients about and, frankly, a lot of our colleagues as well. Because they’re also curious. They want to learn. But they need to be taught. Back in school, you might have thought about this as study skills. How do I organize myself in order to get my schoolwork done? But there’s a much more sophisticated version of that when you think about adult learners that I think we all need to invest in more.', 'Diane Brady: I’m curious, Liz, when you look at companies, what’s usually missing?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: There can be a few different things missing. The interest matters, of course. But one of the most important hallmarks at the company or the organizational level is a long-term growth orientation that naturally favors learning.', 'I can share some anecdotes that really help to bring that to life in terms of what some of those ingredients are. Some elements that I have seen in organizations that are successful at doing this start with storytelling and role modeling by senior leaders that learning and long-term perspective are important.', 'How are they talking about that and demonstrating in their actions that they’re doing that? Secondly, are they putting their money where their mouth is? Are they investing in the types of learning programs, reskilling programs, even explicit in expectations of time spent on learning?', 'How are they doing that? How are they, in what we often call moments that matter—the beginning of a meeting or the end of a meeting—driving a culture and language of learning so that you’re constantly saying, “What are we missing?” or “How can we consider how to do this differently?”', 'How are we creating psychological safety so that people feel comfortable sharing ideas? And, finally, what are the formal processes that you use as well? You know, in the army they had something called the Center for Army Lessons Learned. It was a formal organization that was meant to capture learnings and then make sure the organization adapted.', 'Diane Brady: Like an off-site where you’d all gather together and do a weekend program. Is that what it is?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: Well, that, but they would also even deploy into the battlefield to capture the lessons in real time. So it was both. But it was more of what is the formal mechanism to ensure that the learning and the continuous improvement actually happen and that there is a learning loop.', 'Those are just some of the examples of elements that I’ve seen organizations use to help, at the company level, think about learning. We talk a lot about the individual. But the other one is really the team. Is the team environment set up to enable learning too?', 'Diane Brady: I want to get a little more of a sense of the two of you as individuals. Because you are both people who I’m sure adapted a lot of these lessons to your own life.', 'Liz, in terms of some of the key lessons that you’ve learned either from your work at McKinsey, the military, et cetera, what have you found to be effective techniques that really helped you become a better learner?', 'One of the fundamental lessons I learned at West Point was you have to really learn to follow in order to learn to lead. There was quite a deliberate approach in terms of how that’s done.', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: I’ll share a relatively profound one to start, which—again, one of the fundamental lessons I learned at West Point—was you have to really learn to follow in order to learn to lead. There was quite a deliberate approach in terms of how that’s done.', 'Over the weekend, I happened to be listening to a talk given by the president of Stanford University. And it was interesting. He was talking to a number of individuals who had just won a scholarship. And, of course, they’re eager to go and change the world. He made this comment about, “How did you have the excitement and urgency, but also some patience, to learn how things are done in order to then go and change them? How do you combine the urgency of now with the patience to learn to follow before you can lead?”', 'Diane Brady: So before going to Matt, learning to follow is more about listening than talking. What is learning to follow?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: Learning to follow is listening before talking and learning how to be a contributor so that you can then lead. There are a few ways you can learn how to follow. Number one is to really appreciate and value time spent as an individual contributor and how even you can be a leader in that moment, but also that there is a role to learn the ropes first and to be intentional as you’re doing so.', 'And constantly noticing other elements of leadership around you and how you’re going to use those to help you become a better leader is important as well, but also this real sense that you need to understand and appreciate those other roles as you take on a greater leadership role yourself.', 'Diane Brady: Matt, you’re a very intentional learner. I know that because I’ve taken one of your courses at McKinsey, which I did not finish. I’m catching up because it is so fascinating. Talk about the lessons you’ve learned to make you a better learner. You certainly seem to be a voracious reader of management-thinking and leadership books.', 'Matthew Smith: Well, first I have to ask you, Diane, what did you learn from the course even if you didn’t finish it? Because now you’ve piqued my curiosity.', 'Diane Brady: This voracious way in which you take outside information and you adapt it to your own life is one thing that’s very powerful. The power of getting people within the program to mentor each other is not something I’ve seen.', 'I’m so used to modules being: here’s a video, now click through, click through. To make it a collective exercise I found very useful because I was able to interact with other people, even remotely. I also think that reminders around playing to your strengths and the prioritization and some of the techniques and tips you used were great.', 'To be honest, I let my work agenda get in the way of making the course a priority. So thank you for taping these things going back. That was a lesson learned for me. I have taken a lot out of it. I think that I’m better at prioritizing and making sure that I get the things done that need to be done before I get involved in busywork, which is certainly something we all do.', 'Matthew Smith: Well, first of all, Diane, it’s wonderful to hear the feedback. What we just did there is actually one of the things that I would recommend doing. We actually did a couple of them just in that little moment. Number one, I asked you to reflect on what you actually learned. What you did when you answered was you reinforced the learning for yourself.', 'Because you made sense, you put pieces together, and you said it out loud to another human being, that actually reinforces a lot of how learning happens for each of us. When we talk out loud to others, we deepen the channels in our brain that say, “OK, this is something that is important to me that I’m going to remember.”', 'So that’s one little piece of it. You also said something else that’s important which went into the design of that course that you took, which is we got people to support each other. Because one of the things that many companies miss when they design or roll out digital learning or modules that people can take is that a lot of learning happens through social interactions and conversations.', 'If you can enlist other people around you—it could be peers, it could be your manager, it could just be friends that you have in your office—in your learning and to hold each other accountable for what you’re trying to work on, that actually goes a long way to ensuring the success of the learning. Part of that is we’re all just better when we have an accountability buddy. But part of it is when you’re transparent about what you’re trying to learn or trying to work on, other people start noticing it more and can give you more helpful feedback.', 'So if I say to you, “Diane, I’m trying to get better at doing podcast interviews,” then after we’re done here you’re much more likely to call me up and say, “Hey, Matt, here are some things you did well. And here are some things you could work on next time,” versus if I didn’t make that learning goal clear to you. So it’s setting these goals, enlisting others in the process, talking about what you’re learning, and getting feedback. Those are some of the core building blocks that people can put in place to improve their learning.', 'Diane Brady: What is a learning culture? Another term I’ve heard tossed about is the adaptable organization. What does that look like? Matt, maybe you can talk about the concept of the adaptable organization first.', 'There’s a huge role that organizations play in setting the context and the culture for learning. Like so many things, it starts at the top, and it starts with having a CEO or a senior leader who actually values learning and talks about it very actively.', 'Matthew Smith: We’ve been talking thus far about learning at the individual level, a little bit at the team level, or enlisting others in it. There’s a huge role that organizations play in setting the context and the culture for learning. And there’s a few elements of this. Like so many things, it starts at the top, and it starts with having a CEO or a senior leader who actually values learning and talks about it very actively.', 'That to me is honestly table stakes. Because if people don’t see it as something that’s valued in the organization, they’re much less likely to do it. But I also don’t think that’s enough. Number one, is there a culture or an expectation that people are actually going to take time out to learn? Because you do a lot of learning in the flow of your work. But you actually do sometimes need to step out of the flow and invest in taking a course or studying something on your own.', 'Diane Brady: Do you measure it by the amount of time people take?', 'Matthew Smith: Well, that is one way to measure it. Some organizations do actually set goals or expectations around the number of hours people are going to spend learning. But I’m not sure that is actually the best measure. We all know you can chalk up hours doing something where you’re not really engaged.', 'A better way to build that into the expectations is by linking it to the way you do your performance-management or -review systems. So, for example, at McKinsey, what we’ve been working toward the past couple of years is that rather than [the learning organization] suggesting, and putting out a bunch of offerings—what we’re now doing as part of our review processes—we ask people to think about what their learning-and-development plan should be over the coming months.', 'So when you go through your review, whoever is doing your evaluation will get feedback. They will synthesize that for a number of themes. They will give you recommendations for what learning you should take advantage of in the coming months. And then you will take that and develop a learning-and-development plan for yourself and have an ongoing conversation with your manager or other people around you about how you’re doing against that plan. That, versus just pure counting hours, is a much more deep and effective way of embedding it into the culture.', 'Diane Brady: Liz, earlier in my career I heard a lot about academy companies, these companies that are so great at teaching people. They’re almost like the farm teams for many other companies in addition to being excellent themselves. It’s a very different mindset right now around the business case for this. Do these organizations actually outperform their peers?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: That’s a great question. There are two types of organizations that think about this. One that uses learning and adaptability to outperform their peers, and there’s another category of organizations that I’ll come back to that, quite frankly, have to do it in order to survive. Especially right now, we’re seeing this more than ever.', 'On the first category of organizations using adaptability and learning to outperform their peers, there’s certainly some recent stories and examples that really bring this home. A very famous one is Microsoft and Satya Nadella, who openly cites the move toward a learning culture at Microsoft as one of the critical elements toward driving the growth that the company has experienced under his leadership.', 'One of the elements of that learning culture that he talks a lot about, and we talk a lot about at McKinsey Academy as well, is how to cultivate a growth mindset. This is actually a mindset. We believe, by the way, it really can be cultivated. Some people start with more of it than others, for sure. But it can get better. This is the idea of seeing challenges as opportunities to get better.', 'It’s not an inherent test of the value of you. But it’s an opportunity to learn, which is a really critical element—that is, critical for all organizations that want to use learning and adaptability as a way to outperform. I’m curious about Satya Nadella in part because there’s a real authenticity there around the desire to learn, the desire to create that learning culture. When you’re talking to clients, are there particular things you notice that really signal to you the willingness to really do the hard work to get this done?', 'One of the critical elements is the conviction from a business-unit leader. Whether it’s the CEO or the leader of the business unit that is undergoing the transformation of how important capability building is to achieving the broader impact that the organization aspires. That is an element that we really look for. The CHRO [chief human-resources officer], the head of learning and development absolutely has to be there. That conviction is often there earlier because, by the nature of being in their roles, they get it.', 'Building that conviction in the business leaders as well is an absolutely critical element. Some people come in with it, quite frankly, just because they’ve experienced it elsewhere or that’s how they have grown up. Others have to learn the importance of it. We find you could inspire people through the stories of others as well, by just helping them understand that a critical unlock for the organization’s success is providing those individuals in the company with the new skills that they need to succeed and creating that common language and common way of working.', 'Diane Brady: What are the tactics that companies use, especially those that do need to reinvent themselves?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: It can be overwhelming when you think about all the different skills. But one place that can be helpful to start is by asking yourself, “What are the most critical skills toward driving the business value?” Some of them are technical skills. But we also find that there are more and more softer skills. These skills are also required to be an adaptable leader in the 21st century.', 'Diane Brady: Matt, it makes me think of an article you wrote about critical mindsets and core skills. I know that was both for individuals and for leaders, which obviously cascades up to the company level. Tell us a little bit more about those skills.', 'Matthew Smith: I also want to piggyback on this topic that Liz mentioned, needing to understand the skills that are going to drive a business forward in the future. Some of our own research on this is very eye-opening, but should also be a bit of a wake-up call to learning and development and HR leaders across a lot of companies.', 'We find that 90 percent of companies believe they’re going to have some sort of meaningful skills gap over the coming years. But only 16 percent believe that they’re fully prepared to meet those skills gaps.', 'When we survey leaders, we find—and this, by the way, was work that was actually done pre-COVID-19, so, if anything, these numbers are probably even scarier—we find that 90 percent of companies believe they’re going to have some sort of meaningful skills gap over the coming years. They don’t have the skills today that they think they’re going to need in the future. But only 16 percent believe that they’re fully prepared to meet those skills gaps. So they might know what they need. Or they know that they have a gap. But they’re feeling completely unprepared in terms of, “How are we actually going to close that gap?”', 'The number that’s the most frightening for me and I think others in the learning-and-development space is that 60 percent of them say that their learning-and-development spend has no explicit connection to their strategic objectives, which you may just think is bizarre. It’s an unfortunate side effect of the fact that sometimes this is treated a bit like, if you will, an HR topic, or a silo off to the side. I agree with what Liz was saying earlier about the critical importance of starting with what’s really going to drive value for the business.', 'What are the capabilities and skills that we need to be able to get there? And then working across the organization with learning and development, partnering with the business to say, “OK, how are we actually going to close these gaps? Where do we need to hire? Where do we need to build skills? How do we need to reorient a lot of what we’re doing with training to the most important skills gaps?” That’s the hard work that a lot of organizations, at least in my experience, can struggle with.', 'Diane Brady: One of the challenges with reskilling is it’s not always clear what skills you will need. Especially as disruption comes more rapidly, I would be curious to know what types of skills are these?', 'Matthew Smith: We’ve done a lot of work within McKinsey to look at the skills of the future, and to say, “What are the types of skills that, given all the disruption across industries and given all the technological change, are going to be more in demand and less in demand in the future?” While it does vary a lot by sector, there are some common trends.', 'The one that’s probably the least surprising to people is that technology skills are going to be in much higher demand. That’s probably not a shock to anyone. The second-largest increase, though, is in what you might call human skills: emotional intelligence, ability to collaborate, ability to communicate. Think about all the things that machines can’t do well. These types of skills are also going to be in high demand over the years to come. A lot of the skills that are going to be in less demand are in areas where machines can do well: routine manual tasks, routine cognitive tasks. What are the actual skills that people are thinking are going to be in the jobs of the future?', 'But there’s another underlying piece to this that is very important, which is hiring for and training for adaptability. Look for people who demonstrate an ability to learn new things, who demonstrate learning agility, who demonstrate openness and ability to flex in different directions. We’re all asked to do things that were not necessarily in our job description when we were hired. You can look for those types of skills in people, in addition to maybe the hard skills or the specific skills you’re looking for from a business need. But you can also train those skills.', 'The no-regret action is to build this sense of adaptability in your organization in each of the individuals and a real appreciation for the fact that adaptability is malleable.', 'Diane Brady: Liz, is that part of what you get into? Hiring?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: Absolutely. If you don’t want to start anywhere else, if you don’t want to take anything else away from this podcast, the no-regret action is to build this sense of adaptability in your organization in each of the individuals and a real appreciation for the fact that adaptability is malleable. We all have different starting points in terms of where we are. From our research, we believe that we can help everyone to become more adaptable. It’s both individual attributes and the team environment that helps you get there.', 'But if you had the choice, certainly you want to look to hire people who have that growth mindset and a willingness to embrace new perspectives, new skills. The other element was not just the mindset, it’s the behaviors. How do you help create opportunities for individuals to practice at the edge of being too difficult? You know, stretch them out of their comfort zone and create environments where they feel comfortable doing so.', 'Diane Brady: Tell us a little more about the skills that company leaders should take away from this.', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: The skill that I wanted to share was this idea of how to build resilience in your employees as well. Through COVID-19, we’ve seen even more how important it is to build resilience. I reflect a lot. I was fortunate to have been in the military in the sense of I think I had a lot of experiences there that made me more resilient.', 'Diane Brady: You were in Iraq twice. Is that correct?', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: I was in Iraq twice. But I think even more about the 12-mile-road marches that I had to do in my first summer at West Point and how that built resilience as well. So you don’t have to deploy to a war zone. You don’t have to walk 12 miles with a heavy pack on either. But what is the equivalent of those things in your organization that you’re going to use to help people become more resilient? It’s more important than ever before, not just for our professional lives but for our personal lives as well.', 'Diane Brady: Matt, what are you seeing with the pandemic? Are we becoming more resilient?', 'Matthew Smith: The need for resilience has never been higher. People are getting stress-tested in ways that they’ve never had to deal with before. When I talk with my peers at other organizations, this is probably the number-one need that comes up. We are being stretched.', 'There are people who are learning and growing in different ways through this period and building that resilience muscle. But we need to do more to support people. It is a very, very challenging time for all of us. We all know that. Building these skills of resilience is something that more and more companies can invest in.', 'Diane Brady: On a personal level, how have you incorporated these skills into your lives? I love strategies and tips from people who have been immersed in this.', 'Matthew Smith: I’ll give two quick tips that I try to do. One is there’s a really great concept that was first created by a guy named Ron Heifetz in his research, which is called, “Being on the dance floor and on the balcony.” It means in any moment that you’re in, can you be fully in it?', 'But can you also build the muscle and the habit of mentally stepping out and looking at what’s happening, and looking at how it’s going and how things are working, what’s working, what’s not, and what you can learn from it? If you just build that little mental muscle into your routines, what you’ll find is you’ll just squeeze so much more juice out of every experience.', 'Because you’ll be looking for those little microlearning moments that you can find in almost everything you do. It doesn’t have to be just more hours on the calendar. The second big tip that I’ve tried to incorporate myself is set small and clear goals over a three- to six-month period for what you want to learn and what you want to develop on in that period. Not too many of them; usually I would say three maximum. And then tell other people what you’re working on so that they can support you.', 'Diane Brady: So three in three. Three goals in three months.', 'Matthew Smith: I love the branding. Three goals, three months. Maybe you tell three friends, and then it’s three, three, three. That will create this continuous learning loop that you’ll have. You’ll just keep learning new things every few months and building on it. You’ll develop very quickly. And you’ll also be able to build on that for the next cycle, decide what those goals are, and you’ll continue learning. You’ll build it as a habit, which is the most important thing.', 'Diane Brady: Liz, let me go to you. Tell me a little bit about what you’ve done in terms of incorporating these lessons.', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: I love Matt’s three-in-three branding, and much of what I was going to say is encapsulated in that. One is just being super intentional about what you’re trying to learn right now. I try to be a sponge in every interaction I’m in and see and observe how others are doing things differently, how I’m trying to work on it. Right now, while we’re all stuck at our computers and our desks, I even keep a Post-it Note on my computer, with the one thing that I’m working on right then, so that I can be even that much more intentional and focused on the thing that I’m trying to learn and get better at.', 'The other one is really sharing what you’re trying to work on with a few trusted friends or colleagues who can help give you feedback and hold you accountable and encourage you along the way. It all falls under the three in three. But those are just some of the ways that I personally do it.', 'Diane Brady: It’s great advice, especially as we’re all working from home. And it is something that, of course, we will be continuing to talk about on a personal and professional level for many months and years to come. Liz, Matt, thank you very much.', 'Matthew Smith: Thanks so much, Diane, for having us.', 'Elizabeth Young McNally: Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: That was Liz McNally and Matt Smith.

31,The COVID-19 vaccine: Lessons and challenges,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-covid-19-vaccine-lessons-and-challenges,The rapid deployment of vaccines is key in accelerating the return to normalcy.,"['The rapid deployment of vaccines is key in accelerating the return to normalcy.', 'As policymakers vaccinate their populations against an ever-changing COVID-19, they’re discovering numerous challenges along the way. In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partners Lieven Van der Veken and Tania Zulu Holt share insights on progress and lessons learned so far, and how to help get the vaccine distributed as quickly and safely as possible. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. The COVID-19 vaccines are here, and that has been creating a lot of hope and challenges for how to make these vaccines available on an unprecedented scale. Joining me today to talk about how we can achieve this, and the lessons learned so far, are two McKinsey partners who’ve been doing a lot of work in this area. Lieven Van der Veken is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Geneva office. A doctor by training, he leads our social sector and our public health work in Europe. Lieven, welcome.', 'Lieven Van der Veken: Good to be here.', 'Diane Brady: And Tania Zulu Holt is a healthcare economist and partner in the London office, where she works with donor institutions globally, including on vaccine delivery. Tania, welcome.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: Thank you, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: So, Lieven, where are we at this stage in the distribution?', 'Lieven Van der Veken: We have to start by recognizing that there are a large number of countries that have not started vaccinations yet. Those that have started are in very different stages of the rollout. Having said that, it is clear that all countries go through roughly four phases as their systems are scaling, as their supply scales, and as their demand evolves over time.', 'They go from an initial phase, which is all about getting early-access authorization and then early supplies, which are often very limited, to a second phase, when the delivery systems are scaling—often with a little bit of a time lag behind supplies.', 'Then there’s the phase when the systems to vaccinate are up and running and new innovations such as vaccination centers are brought online, but the supply starts to fall short again. There’s a final phase when there is a system that works very well and can scale. The supply is getting to levels that are more significant. That’s when demand starts to be an issue. There is one country today, Israel, that is in that scenario.', 'Diane Brady: Tania, I’ll go to you in terms of the challenges now with regard to supply.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: One of the questions that many people are asking themselves is whether there’ll be enough vaccines for the world. There are many unknowns. On the one hand, there’s a diverse group of authorized, but also pipeline, vaccine products from producers from all over the world. On the other hand, there are also unknowns about the manufacturing-capacity scale-up and scale-out.\', ""If we do take a look at just the publicly announced capacity of all the manufacturers that have a vaccine authorized in at least one country, we’re actually looking at enough manufacturing capacity to cover roughly 85 percent of the world’s population. If we are adding some of the vaccines that are still in late-stage development, we’ll probably get up toward 100 percent of the global population being able to have vaccines by the end of 2021. Of course, that\'s the total that will be manufactured. A lot else needs to happen for these vaccines to reach that percentage of the population."", \'Diane Brady: Here in the US, there’s been a strain of euphoria that the pandemic is almost over. Yet at the same time, Lieven, I keep hearing about these new variants of the virus. How does that change the scenario planning for this?', 'Lieven Van der Veken: First of all, the arrival of new variants shouldn’t surprise anybody. The viral strains have been evolving all along. Having said that, it is a very important and very urgent reminder that nobody is safe until everybody is safe. And that means we need to vaccinate everyone.', '‘The arrival of new variants shouldn’t surprise anybody. ... It is a very important and very urgent reminder that nobody is safe until everybody is safe.’', 'Even if a country today may be protected from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic raging through a population by vaccination, unless everybody in the world actually achieves a sufficient level of protection, new variants can keep emerging. There are scenarios when the vaccines that we currently have do not confer protection against these variants.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: I want to put the numbers I mentioned before into perspective. The truth is that the supply picture is quite nuanced. We do know that most of the capacity has currently been contracted and reserved by a number of the high-income countries. That means that there is a significant amount of the low- and middle-income countries that have not yet received vaccines or have only received very few doses. While we, on an aggregate, might have sufficient supplies, on a country and on a per capita basis, the rollout is much more nuanced.', 'Diane Brady: Lieven, what are some of the lessons that we’ve learned over the past few months?', 'Lieven Van der Veken: First, we have to recognize that the scale-up, even though it has felt slow and painful in many settings, is of an unprecedented nature. Even those countries that may have started out of the gates a bit slower—based on certain strategic choices or certain operational challenges—most of them have actually caught up with the supply that’s available to them. That’s an incredible achievement and the result of tens and hundreds of thousands of people working tirelessly day and night to deliver on this third major challenge of the vaccine campaign: the delivery. There’s the discovery, the manufacturing scale-up, and the delivery.', 'As we look back, we should not forget to celebrate that the development of the vaccine has come with unprecedented speed. Never before has a vaccine been developed with this speed. Never before have we had five or six candidates that actually have been approved in countries across the world. (That number has since risen to ten.) Never before have we actually seen such a manufacturing scale-up and scale-out with collaborations across the industry, collaborations across the globe. So there’s a lot to celebrate.', 'Having said that, we also have learned to appreciate how fragile all of that progress is, how important it is to continue to innovate the vaccine candidates in light of new variants, how fragile the global manufacturing networks really are. If we no longer ship the right supplies and the right equipment across the world, then plants could actually come to a halt.', 'We have learned how fragile the delivery scale-up is in cases where communications are falling short and populations lose their trust in one or multiple of the vaccine candidates. So a lot to celebrate—unprecedented speed, unprecedented scale—but also a lot of examples of the fragility of the progress we achieved to date.', 'Diane Brady: Tania, you’ve done a lot of work in the past around public trust. How are we doing on that front in terms of people trusting the efficacy of the vaccine and feeling that they want to get it?', 'Tania Zulu Holt: So as the vaccine has been introduced in countries, what we’ve typically seen is that the willingness to take the vaccine has increased. There are a couple of outliers in some of the Asian countries. In general, it is pointing in the right direction. Of course, with vaccine hesitancy, one element is about how the average, general population is thinking. Typically, there are subpopulation groups where we see patterns of much lower demand.', 'That’s certainly something that we need to watch very carefully in different countries. There are already some concerning signs in certain countries around some of those subpopulations where we’re seeing higher rejection rates.', 'Diane Brady: Lieven, there are so many factors that are swirling around with the decision making on this. Can you tell us about the “6As,” and what that does for framing the discussion? That’s “available, administrable, accessible, acceptable, affordable, and accountable.”', 'Lieven Van der Veken: We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the 60, 70 elements that one needs to get right. And one needs to plan for those in parallel. First of all, you need to have the vaccines available, right? The vaccine needs to be approved by the regulators. It needs to be there with the right supply, which includes increasing manufac\\xadturing, the sourcing of the needles. It is a complex effort in its own right: the vaccine and everything else you need for the vaccination.', 'The second step is “administrable.” You need to be able to actually identify the patients. You need to have the vaccination centers up and running, if that’s what you’re going to use, or have your healthcare workers trained.', 'Third, the vaccine does need to be accessible. It needs to be in the right place at the right time. Some of these vaccines actually have five doses in one vial. That means you need to be able to have the right strategy and the right logistics to have those five vaccinations lined up in the course of a couple of hours. How do you do that?', 'Fourth, it needs to be acceptable. The population needs to be ready. Your healthcare workforce needs to be trained. People need to be ready to actually receive the vaccination with excitement.', 'Fifth, “affordable.” It is important that there are no barriers in affordability to ensure equitable access to the vaccine. And last, what we’d call “accountable,” which is a fairly broad bucket.', 'Diane Brady: You both come at this from a different prism: you as a doctor, Lieven. Tania, you as an economist. Tania, you have a lot of experience in this area. Are there lessons that we can draw from previous situations with regard to administering vaccines? How do you make it acceptable to everybody?', 'Tania Zulu Holt: This is an incredibly important topic that has been discussed for many years. And we can go back in the US, all the way to the 1950s when the polio vaccination campaign was under way. At the time, you had Elvis Presley literally going on national TV in order to motivate some people.', 'Diane Brady: We need an Elvis.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: Exactly. It’s also important that the communication is really a two-way process. It needs to be equal listening and telling at the same time. Also, we know that knowledge is important, but it’s not sufficient. We’ll need to understand different microsegments of the population to truly see what is driving the behaviors and what will ultimately drive people’s choices. We’ll need to really use all the various communication tools that are available to us: everything from the more classic public-health campaigns to using social media and other tools that are available to us now.', 'Lieven Van der Veken: The initial months of vaccine rollout have reinforced how critically important communication and engagement is—communication, first of all, between all of those involved and their response in the vaccination scale-up. We have unfortu\\xadnately seen quite a few instances where differ\\xadent parts of the system that are trying to drive the vaccination are pointing fingers at each other, are not necessarily always putting the system and the acceleration first. It’s understandable because of the pressure, but it actually slows down the vaccination.', 'The second challenge that we’ve seen is communication within the broader set of stake\\xadholders. Communication with healthcare professionals, communication with influencers, communication with the media, when it’s so important that there continues to be a dialogue of trust, where everybody can get access to transparent data, can get access to the right information.', 'Third, communication with the broader public. And there are not that many environments today where governments or health authorities actually have direct access or a trusted base channel to engage with populations. And we see when there is a certain narrative developing in a country that needs to be engaged with, these governments struggle with that.', 'We would continue to urge everybody involved in scaling the vaccine delivery to invest heavily in the communication with the people who plan and who structure the delivery—and with the broader stakeholder landscaping through the healthcare delivery colleagues, and then with the broader population at large. That is going to be so important in bringing this journey home.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: Yes. Absolutely. And not only have the lessons been taken to heart, but I think the systems are really realizing that it’s an ongoing exercise. These campaigns will be in many countries going on for the whole of 2021, and in some countries likely into 2022.', 'And the situation continues to change. You’re never done with the 6As. You constantly need to redo your plans every time there is a new development. And I think we should continue to expect that there are developments, whether those are new variants or whether those are new demand patterns or new vaccines that are being authorized and coming in. The systems will continue to go through updating their plans using the equivalent of a 6A framework.', '‘You constantly need to redo your plans every time there is a new development. And I think we should continue to expect that there are developments, whether those are new variants or whether those are new demand patterns or new vaccines.’', 'Lieven Van der Veken: So the one thing that is happening today the same way it always has in these moments of crisis and epidemic or pandemic outbreaks is that there is very little time available to look around the corner. And so of course nobody has a crystal ball. But there are a number of scenarios that one can already imagine today that may have major implications for tomorrow.', 'For example, it’s possible that in a couple of months we’ll not just be talking about managing a supply chain of two or three different vaccines in a given community, but also actually managing two or three different vaccines, maybe four or five, with a subset of those actually being better suited for certain variants.', 'How do you think about that? What is your vaccination strategy in that environment? But also, logistically, how do you keep track? And how do you actually optimize and adjust your supply chain, your communication activities, your data gathering to significantly increase the complexity of the available vaccines that you are using in the context of some of these variant vaccines?', 'That is a scenario which is actually not unlikely, given what we know today. But it is a scenario for which not all systems actually have the bandwidth today to start planning.', 'Diane Brady: Lieven raises a good point, Tania. It would seem that you’d have to have a very sophisticated degree of data analytics and tech\\xadnology in place to really manage this rollout. How is this happening in economies that may not be at that point?', 'Tania Zulu Holt: I think what’s interesting around some of the low- and middle-income countries is, unlike some of the high-income countries that historically had strong flu-vaccination programs, that they haven’t experienced reaching the adult population. And many of the low- and middle-income countries have experienced it predominantly with the children immunization programs.', 'So you can say on one hand, these countries actually have a relatively strong starting point with some healthcare infrastructure in terms of cold chain and people who have experience with vaccination and so forth. But, of course, they don’t have the experience as such reaching the adult population.', 'And second, in some of the low- and middle-income countries, that’s also where today we have most of the vaccine-preventable death, meaning that many of those countries are not sufficiently reaching the population with their children immunization programs.', 'And so we get to a point where these countries need to scale up beyond the first 3 percent, which is typical, healthcare workers and the most vulnerable population of people within the urban centers. And I think we should expect that these countries are going to have some scale-up challenges going to the rural populations and are going to reach beyond the first 3 percent to 20 percent and so forth.', 'And those advances relate to having sufficient cold-chain equipment, making sure that they train enough healthcare workers, and having the required data systems so that they can report on a live basis the different vaccinations. You have to be able to know which patients got what vaccine, so then people come back for the second dose that some of the vaccines will require.', 'Then we make sure that person gets the same vaccine for the second dose. And they are called back into the system in a timely manner. These are of course all things that are in high-income countries to a large extent and are being done and managed with fairly sophisticated data and information systems.', 'We are seeing that low- and middle-income countries are rapidly investing and investing into those systems and scaling them up. And hopefully they’ll do that in a timely manner, not just for the impact of this current pandemic, but also for the general immunization systems in these countries that are still at times lagging behind from a coverage perspective.', 'Diane Brady: One of the challenges it seems in this campaign is that we have multiple vaccines. And how are the gatekeepers managing that, Lieven?', 'Lieven Van der Veken: It has indeed become a very complex landscape. Because there’s a range of vaccines, you have to look for a set of vaccines that have higher efficacy against certain variants. Decision makers do start most often in my conver\\xadsations with them from the perspective: does the vaccine confer protection against severe disease or death?', 'We have seen that the protection against severe disease for a number of the vaccines is actually higher than the protection against overall disease. There may be settings in which these vaccines no longer offer the 98 percent protection that perhaps was found in some of the clinical trials. These vaccines often continue to be incredibly important life-saving interventions in spite of what perhaps may sometimes be the narrative. Let’s not forget before this all started in October, November, the world was planning for a 50 percent efficacy of impact on severe disease of the vaccine.', 'The world was planning to celebrate 50 percent as efficacious and as something that should absolutely be recommended. So we may have gotten a bit spoiled with the incredible and beyond-expectation results of the first vaccines. Having said that, not only do we have these vaccines that are of very high efficacy and confer protection, but also, everybody does want to continue to access the vaccine that is most suited to their environment. That will continue to be a journey of understanding much better what is the virus that is circulating today.', 'We call certain variants the British variant, the South African variant, or a variant from some other place. But who knows whether that is where these variants originated? Our ability to detect variants is still very, very low. Our surveillance systems are still very, very weak. The first thing we need to do is really deepen our understanding of the circu\\xadlating viral strains and detect new ones.', 'There is an exercise to match the vaccine candidates with the optimal environment in which to use them. I have to say there is a scenario. Today, it’s all about access to a vaccine, not just about access to the vaccine that is most suited for that environment. But in the next couple of months, we may see that dialogue shift.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: That is very interesting, isn’t it, Lieven? Because if you kind of play that out, it could even mean that maybe countries will need to exchange vaccines with each other so that they get access to the vaccine that’s the most suitable for the variants that might be at high circulation in their particular geography.', 'The other thing here is that increased collaboration is going to be critical to moving the world forward, in terms of the vaccines. But we’re also seeing that people want to think about when they can start traveling again—and about vaccine-certification documents and so forth. These things, of course, are only as valuable as the other countries that are willing to accept the documentation that you’re able to put together for your vaccinated population. So I think we’re also continuing to move into a phase of increased collaboration so that the countries can solve the pandemic together.', 'Lieven Van der Veken: I totally agree, Tania. And that points back to the old challenge that we discussed a few times, which is this incredible tension between optimizing for the best use of an individual vaccine dose and actually getting the biggest benefit across the world and actually trying to complete vaccination in individual countries, which is an incredible tension to work with. Because on one hand, we actually see incredible progress. COVAX [COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access] has brought vaccines to a large number of countries much, much faster and is scaling much, much faster than the closest historic precedent, H1N1 campaigns, was ever able to do, which is fantastic.', 'But at the same time, we actually do see countries that do not have access yet. And we do see continued pressure on these global allocations and global distribution mechanisms to find access to the dose and find access to the right doses. So the tension is live. It’s playing out every hour of every day in the world.', 'Diane Brady: So, Tania, I’m curious, what’s been the role of influencers in this campaign? You mentioned that it’s been important in previous ones.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: Absolutely. We can reflect back all the way to the polio campaign in the US when we had Elvis Presley taking a polio vaccine on national TV, or most recently in northern Nigeria where we’ve had the Emir of Kano giving the polio vaccine to children.', 'In this current pandemic, what we’ve seen is actually the politicians doing this. In most countries, the heads of states or the like have been on national TV showing that they’re going first. And then the second group of people have really been the healthcare workers, who have also been receiving many of the first doses. They have been part of also building trust in the vaccines.', 'Diane Brady: I know it’s hard, Lieven, to say if this is the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. Nobody wants to play soothsayer. Yet many politicians and others out there are already breathing a sigh of relief and are starting to remove some of the restrictions to try and stop the spread of the virus. Can you give us some sense of where we are?', 'Lieven Van der Veken: So, Diane, I’m an optimist, right? But I do think it’s too early to say it’s the beginning of the end. Because there are still so many twists and turns that actually could happen. But what is a fact, and what you start seeing happening in certain environments, is that the vaccine does reset our relationship with the pandemic.', '‘What is a fact, and what you start seeing happening in certain environments, is that the vaccine does reset our relationship with the pandemic.’', 'Diane Brady: Tania, any thoughts on that? Especially somebody who’s studied other public-health campaigns, anything that surprised you about this one?', 'Tania Zulu Holt: No, I’m an optimist, I believe, on this point as well. But I would say when we take some of the low- and middle-income countries, I think we have to acknowledge that the starting point for many of those countries is that COVID-19 isn’t the largest killer in those countries.', 'And there are many, many other priorities. And I think if nothing else, the pandemic has certainly brought health security, the importance of investing in strong health systems, to the forefront of the political debate, but also the general debate among the population.', 'And so as we continue to jointly fight this pandemic, I think we’ll also in many countries see a continued heightened awareness and focus on healthcare at large. And hopefully that means that we will not just tackle the disease burden of COVID-19, but also many of the other big killers in the world that we still have today, whether that’s malaria, TB, HIV, et cetera.', 'Lieven Van Der Veken: So it’s such an excellent point, Tania. And while, of course, a lot still needs to be said and written about the journey of adoption of vaccines and their protection, I do hope that, relatively fast, the most vulnerable will be protected from severe disease.', 'And that allows communities to find balanced solu\\xadtions where the direct impact of COVID-19 is balanced with the indirect impact of COVID-19, which also has been enormous: the impact on psychological disorders, the impact on mental health, the impact on the broad health challenges, the incredible health backlog that is building up in many communities, the undiagnosed cancer treatments, the difficult social situations, the difficult situations in households leading to an increase of abuse in many settings. There are many, many, many elements of the indirect impacts of COVID-19. And if anything, if the vaccines can already help us reset that balance a little bit in the next couple of weeks and months, then that will be a major purpose in its own right.', 'Diane Brady: What lessons do you think we’ll take from this or have you taken from this?', 'Tania Zulu Holt: The key lesson that I have taken, and I think that I hope the world has also taken, is that collaboration really matters. We have rolled these vaccines to market, to patients faster than any other public-health intervention that we have ever seen before.', 'And we can still do better. And I’m convinced that we will do better. So as the world starts to evaluate what we’ve done well and what we could have done better, I’m very, very hopeful that, for the next potential outbreak pandemic, we will respond faster and at even larger scale. But then I think the underpinning learning from this is that it took collab\\xadoration between many different kinds of stakeholders to get to where we are today.', 'Lieven Van Der Veken: Tania, I could not agree more. I was in a different setting the other day. And someone was asked, “What does COVID-19 stand for to you?” And they said, “There’s a reason COVID-19 starts with ‘co.’ It’s the ‘co’ of collab\\xadoration.” Nothing of what we have seen, not the fast development, not the manufacture and scale-up, not the delivery that’s happening now, with all its challenges, would be possible without collaboration—collaboration between innovators, collaboration within a country, collaboration between countries. We can only hope, I can only hope, that that is what we’ll take away, and we will build a stronger, more collaborative global health system and ecosystem as a result of this.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: I think we should never forget that this has been a massive humanitarian tragedy that we’ve all lived through all over the world, since the beginning of 2020. It has taken a massive toll on people’s mental health. People have lost their jobs. People are missing the most basic act of being able to give a hug to your parents, to your loved ones.', 'So as much as part of this discussion, of course, becomes technical—we talk about the excitement of science and responsibility of speed, et cetera—we should never forget that this is also an opportunity for us to transition into the next normal.', 'We talk about the economic impact from people and businesses going under. But there’s also the human impact: the mental health, the other pieces of what makes our lives valuable that I think we are only starting to see, scratching, frankly, the surface of those. That’s also one of the reasons for the importance of this vaccine work.', 'Diane Brady: Lieven?', 'Lieven Van der Veken: My message would be to think ahead. Because every day or every week that we can actually reach protection of the vulnerable, and hopefully reach herd immunity, that will be the end of the pandemic. And that is so important, not just because of the lives that are directly affected by COVID-19, which has amounted to an incredible toll in the last year, but also for all the indirect effects.', 'My wife is a pediatrician. The number of times she comes home with really dramatic stories about the situations in which children find themselves as a result of the lockdown measures, as a result of the mental-health implications, is tragic. That is, I think, what should keep us all going, to try to do this as fast as we can, to scale as fast as we can, to actually try to alleviate that human suffering.', 'Diane Brady: Right. Lieven, as you were talking, I did hear occasional sounds of children playing. What I think about is how to get this next generation, the children, playing again and back to school. Hope really is, I think, such an important driver in society. Lieven, Tania, thank you very much for sharing your insights during a difficult time and a difficult time to certainly make predictions. So thank you for joining us.', 'Tania Zulu Holt: Thank you.', 'Lieven Van der Veken: Thank you, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: That was Lieven Van der Veken and Tania Zulu Holt.

An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. What a year for fashion it has been. In this show, we’re going to talk about it with two people who know it like few others. Anita Balchandani is a partner in the London office who leads our work in apparel, fashion, and luxury in the UK, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.', 'Achim Berg is a senior partner in Frankfurt and global leader of McKinsey’s Apparel, Fashion & Luxury service line. Together, they co-led The State of Fashion 2021 report, which McKinsey publishes jointly with The Business of Fashion. Anita and Achim, welcome.', 'Achim, let’s start with you. What is the state of fashion?', 'Achim Berg: It’s a challenged state. We’ve seen a year like no other. It’s going to be the worst year for the fashion and luxury industry since collecting any figures. On development, it’s unprecedented. It’s not comparable to a financial crisis. It’s probably closer to what people must have seen during the Great Depression. So it’s a really bad year and devastating for the industry.', 'Diane Brady: Now, Anita, it’s understandable. We’ve been sitting home. In fact, when I told somebody I was doing this podcast, she said, “The state of fashion is sweatpants. I haven’t left my home in seven months.” So is this simply a question of obviously retailers have been closed, and that’s simply impeded sales?', 'Anita Balchandani: Great question, Diane. It’s clear that athleisure and casual-wear sales have seen a huge acceleration over this pandemic. But let’s not forget, so has digital. While overall industry sales are down—there’s no question about that, especially earlier on in the pandemic when food and health and safety were far more important than fashion on the minds of consumers—what we have seen is a huge acceleration and step change in online channels.', 'In many countries, as of this year, 40 percent of all sales will be digital. As players have seen stores reopen, digital channels continue to grow. So we think that has been one of the silver linings and one of the areas of opportunity that the industry has been able to play with and work with over this last year.', 'Achim Berg: We’ve also seen a casualization underway.', 'Diane Brady: Casualization? That’s a great term. What does that mean?', 'Achim Berg: It means dresses have become much more casual. But that is not an invention of COVID-19. It’s a trend we’ve seen for a long while: moving away from more formal wear, having casual Fridays not only on Fridays but also from Monday to Thursday. Of course, working from home without the restrictions that you typically have in an office has an impact on how you dress.', 'On the other hand, we should not forget that we’re lacking many occasions for which people dress up. Weddings have been canceled and postponed. Concerts have been canceled. A lot of culture and people-gathering had to be canceled due to the pandemic. All of that has an impact on how we dress, what we shop for, and how we shop for it.', 'Diane Brady: So when I look at the reports from previous years, Anita, you do talk a lot about the disruption in the industry. Has this accelerated the trends that you were already watching?', 'Anita Balchandani: What we’ve seen through COVID-19 is indeed an acceleration of a lot of the trends that were already underway. Whether you look at digital, sustainability, or even athleisure and casualization, these were all trends that we were seeing before the crisis. If anything, they’ve been amplified over the course of the crisis.', 'There definitely have been a few things that you could pin specifically on the crisis. One is clearly international travel, which has driven segments like luxury and travel retail and has clearly stalled. That was probably one of the areas where we saw a stalling or reversal of a trend. But in everything else that we look at, COVID-19 has accelerated many of the trends that we’ve seen.', 'Diane Brady: Achim, what kinds of players have really proven to be most resilient in this situation, or even most vulnerable?', 'Achim Berg: Let’s start with the winners of this. It’s actually the winners we had identified before, and, at least to a very large extent, the industry is a winner-takes-all industry. The top 20 percent of the industry was already responsible for the lion’s share of value creation.', 'Our past analysis also showed that only 45 percent of the companies really generate an economic profit, which means they not only earn their cost of capital but also really create some margin at the end. That got accelerated through COVID-19.', 'To a very large extent, the industry is a winner-takes-all industry. The top 20 percent of the industry was already responsible for the lion’s share of value creation.', 'By now, only 27 percent are expected to be value creators. If you ask which companies are those, you could say to a certain extent they’re the typical suspects: very strong brands with a strong balance sheet that were already in a better position when this crisis hit.', 'They were more digital. They were more international, with a stronger exposure to China. They were also able to invest in sustainability and in really close relationships with consumers through modern technology, through social media, and through all the innovations that we’ve seen in the industry.', 'Diane Brady: Anita, I’m contemplating this 73 percent of companies being value-destroying if the 27 percent are value-creating. When I look at that particular trend, is part of the issue during this crisis brand loyalty? Certainly we’ve seen at the retail level, consumers have been less loyal to the brands we put on our shelves. Is that similar to the clothes we now put on our bodies?', 'Anita Balchandani: Absolutely. The trend of a greater share of the industry now being in value-destruction territory is clearly accelerated from the run rate we were seeing prior to COVID-19. We would put this down to a number of different factors. Let’s not forget at the start of the crisis, fashion was not a top priority for consumers. People were busy with food, with health, and with a number of other priorities.', 'This pandemic has forced a demand rethink, certainly in the earlier part of the crisis. The second factor that’s playing out here is what we wear. The product mix of that has been dramatically different, owing to the fact that we’re all now spending much more time at home. All of that has caused a real demand shock in the system.', 'You’ve had the second factor here, which is a lot of the channels that a number of brands would rely on—for example, wholesale channels, independent retailers, et cetera—have actually been at the sharp end of and seen the pain from the crisis. And finally, you’ve had a huge pivot to digital.', 'If you were a player that wasn’t fully able to capitalize on that, then we’ve typically seen a deflection; brands and consumers absolutely have shown to us during the crisis that they’re open for change. They’re open to trying new brands.', 'We have seen loyalty being questioned in a way. We’ve also seen greater propensity to try new brands, and particularly channels online. Those have typically been the players that to some extent have also been, relatively speaking, more resilient.', 'Diane Brady: Achim, that propensity to change seems to be an opportunity, does it not? What are you telling people? Let’s say I’m a retailer. I’m a fashion brand that’s on the losing side of the equation at the moment. What can I do?', 'Achim Berg: The first good news is it’s fashion. If you really understand the trends, if you make your product relevant just from a product point of view, you can still play. So it’s art and science. And the art part will always be strong in this industry.', 'On the science part, it’s difficult. If you’ve missed the train on digital, if you are undercapitalized and lack now the budgets to invest in the future, and if you have to deal with a lot of the legacy of what used to be retail dominated, of course there are a lot of challenges. We will see a massive consolidation. But it also means that this consolidation will give some room to breathe and will provide some market-share opportunities for those that get through this and will likely be embarking from this crisis in a stronger fashion.', 'Diane Brady: So consolidation, meaning the brands become part of a larger conglomerate? Or that the brands disappear?', 'Achim Berg: We’ve seen after the financial crisis a lot of what we call zombie brands, brands that were still around but that were undercapitalized, were also not really in fashion with the consumers but were still somehow alive and managing to get from one year to the other. In that respect, 2020 will make a difference. And 2021 will also prove to be different.', 'Diane Brady: So Anita, we’d be remiss in talking about fashion if we didn’t talk about the trends. Both of you certainly weigh in here. But did anything strike you this year, or anything looking ahead, that you see as more of the motif of our tastes?', 'Anita Balchandani: The one thing that we’ve seen is the trend around casualization, but we could well imagine that there is a revival toward glamour as we start to come out of this. We’re already seeing that the need for self-expression doesn’t go away because we have just been through a pandemic.', 'So to some extent, we think the demand for product that is more special, more glamorous, et cetera, will make a comeback. We anticipate—and you’ll see in the report—that nearly 90 percent of industry executives feel that the working model of the future will be hybrid. People are typically going to be working from home two to three days and the rest in the office.', 'We might see some fluctuating behavior, which is really sort of dressing up and looking your best on the days that you are out and being much more casual and cocooned when you’re in the home. However, what we are also likely to see is that the new variant of glamour will also come with a degree of comfort.', 'People have realized that clothing that’s comfort\\xadable, that falls well, that feels good, that is well made has become much more important, given the lives that we’ve been leading. So that probably is something that will continue.', 'People have realized that clothing that’s comfortable, that falls well, that feels good, that is well made has become much more important, given the lives that we’ve been leading.', 'Diane Brady: Goodbye, four-inch heels. I can’t say I’ll miss them.', 'So, Achim, there certainly seems to be more discussion of sustainability. Is that a trend that’s going to transform the priorities in fashion?', 'Achim Berg: We’ve seen that transformation underway for a while. In last year’s report, we said, “Sustainability will be the big topic in 2020.” Despite the fact that obviously the coronavirus crisis was the big topic, sustainability still stayed hugely relevant.', 'We’ve also published a report called Fashion on Climate together with our partners from the Global Fashion Agenda that looks into the CO₂ footprint of the fashion industry on the planet and what it takes in order to reach the Paris Agreement targets. And that is massive. The industry needs to do a lot to bring the emissions down by a minimum of 50 percent.', 'The question is, how is COVID-19 impacting that? The jury is still out. Market research makes us believe that people have become more conscious. They had time to think about it. They had time to look into their wardrobes. They had time to realize that they need far less fashion if they don’t have the occasions to wear it.', 'I think that a jogging pant can get you a long way these days. But we will see. If the Roaring Twenties are back and if we are all going to celebrate that the pandemic has vanished, we might go back to buying more. And then we hopefully buy more with sustainability in mind.', 'Diane Brady: Anita, I’ve seen some strange bedfellows, luxury brands partnering up with what essentially are resale sites, big brands buying streetwear brands. What’s going on?', 'Anita Balchandani: This day of reckoning for fashion is probably broader than just about sustainability. It’s a whole revisit of how the fashion industry works and to reimagine it in a way that’s future-proof.', 'Some of those examples are really a recognition that whether it’s pre-owned, whether it’s resale, whether it’s casualization, these are trends that are here to stay for the consumer of tomorrow. If you’re a luxury brand that’s going to remain relevant in the next decade, then some of these opportunities present tailwinds that you should be accelerating toward as well.', 'This moment—and certainly the last nine months—has really shown us that there are almost no sacred cows in a way. Fashion businesses are taking stock of how they can reshape their futures on a number of different dimensions.', 'Achim Berg: It’s also a great example to see how the one and the others can be connected. Because one of the key issues for the fashion industry when it comes to sustainability is that the garments are not worn as long as they should be worn.', 'The fact that a secondary market really got a boost through digital innovation—because it’s now a digital exercise, and it’s somehow lost its stigma with the younger consumers, and even became trendy—is a nice way to see how technical innovation, a new consumer group, and sustainability come together and create a whole new market and a better footprint for the industry.', 'Diane Brady: What are the conditions right now for young designers who are starting out? Is it more difficult, or in some ways do they have a wider script to find a market, frankly?', 'Achim Berg: On the one hand, we see a consoli\\xaddation of brands. So you could think that the opportunities for young designers will become fewer. On the other side, the digitization of the whole industry, the fact that you can basically start your own brand, bring it to a broader audience than your local environment—through digital platforms, through direct-to-consumer, through social media—also provides opportunities. I’m not concerned that we’re going to have a lack of creativity, of new designers. That’s what the whole industry lives off of. And everybody in this industry is well advised to nurture that.', 'Anita Balchandani: I’d also say that it really depends on the life stage of the brand. We actually believe it’s easier today to start a brand and to launch some\\xadthing if you’re a designer because you have a lot of digital innovation to be able to access a global consumer. You’ve got access to crowdfunding and sources of capital, all of which we believe are easier today than they might have been historically.', 'However, when it comes to scaling up a brand—when designers need to scale, for example—I think that’s where we probably start to see that [consolidation]. And if you look at the beauty industry as an analog, a lot of the disruptive start-ups were really able to gain momentum, but ultimately actually have found themselves and their homes to be within a larger business, to really help them with what it takes to scale up the business in a global way. So the opportunities for designers and what that looks like may vary by life cycle on the start-up phase versus the scale-up phase.', 'Diane Brady: The spiritual center of fashion traditionally is certainly Europe and to a large extent North America. You are in Europe, the Middle East, Africa. Anita, let me start with you. In terms of the global perspective, both consumption trends and the innovation that we’re seeing, is there still this pivot toward European brands? Or are you seeing shifts there?', 'Anita Balchandani: It’s a great question. If we start to think about how brands are discovered today and what drives consumers to shop them, then I think we’re living in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected. It makes it much easier for consumers around the world to find that designer or that label from Paris versus America.', 'Let’s not forget that a lot of the online platforms are also making it possible for brands from Asia, or indeed even manufacturers from Asia, to be able to connect with consumers around the world. So to that extent, the flavor overall is getting much more global because of the way brands are discovered and the role that digital channels have to play in that.', 'But equally, this also is starting to show the hall\\xadmarks of a winner-takes-all market where the big brands have proven that they are more resilient. In many ways, consumers have gravitated toward these bigger brands that have a clearer value proposition and a clearer positioning in consumers’ minds. Then you could argue that some of the bigger brands are really setting the scene for consumer demand around the world.', 'Diane Brady: That’s a great point. Achim, you’d mentioned Asia. Certainly from an economic point of view, we can understand how that’s becoming a bigger force. From a distribution point of view and some of the online platforms and such, that also seems to be a factor. Why is Asia so important in fashion right now?', 'Achim Berg: You’re absolutely right. Asia is very important. And let’s name it. It’s mainly China that is driving the increase in demand. You have highly developed, big, and relevant markets like Japan and South Korea. But if you look at growth rates in recent years, and also in this year, China is probably the only country with a positive GDP growth.', 'That has a massive impact on the industry. We were already writing two years ago that the center of gravity is moving back to the East. That’s exactly what we saw in 2020. The whole industry has seen how dependent we are on the Chinese market.', 'It started at the beginning of last year when a lot of the more midmarket brands were concerned about their growth because of the outbreak of COVID-19. We’ve seen a much harder lesson for the luxury industry afterward. A lot of the luxury industry in Europe, also in North America, was and currently still is dependent on the international traveler from China, to a lesser extent also from the Middle East and from India.', 'Now that this consumer is unable to make it into Europe and North America, that consumption goes away. It is repatriated in a way in China. People have really started to consume luxury domestically in China, even if prices are 20 to 30 percent higher than in Europe.', 'It also shows the complete lack of sales we’ve seen in Europe, which now funnily leads the luxury brands to go back to the local customers. Given that we don’t expect travelers to come back until, let’s say, later this year or early ’22, and that things only normalize in three to five years, there will be a lot of focus on local and regional customers in Europe and in North America in the next couple of years.', 'Diane Brady: Anita, what about the store experience, since that’s so critical to fashion? Is it dead?', 'Anita Balchandani: Look, we’ve all seen the acceleration in digital channels. There’s no question that the role of stores and the scale of a portfolio that is appropriate for a brand or retailer to have is going to be called into question. Many will be reviewing their store portfolios and indeed their rental cost space.', 'Having said that, we believe there’s going to be a reimagined role of the store as well that will emerge from all this. Particularly, we’ve been quite excited to see some of the innovation that finally makes the merging of online and offline channels a reality.', 'For example, we’ve seen players draw on customers who are on a website, able to connect with colleagues in store for customer service. We’ve seen in many cases store colleagues starting to pick and pack and get customer orders ready to ship.', 'We’ve actually seen for the first time probably much greater integration and ability of both store colleagues and physical locations to also power the digital experience. That’s going to be an exciting area of innovation for the future.', 'Diane Brady: So much of fashion is tactile but also event-driven. Here in New York, Fashion Week is an event that extends far beyond the world of fashion. I want to ask a more personal question, Anita, about your own habits and how they’ve changed and what you miss. You must have spent a lot of time on the road prior to this.', 'Anita Balchandani: Indeed. I always like to look at the positives that have come out of this, and clearly some of the other things that we miss and crave in a way. The fact that this has brought about just a much more thoughtful reflection on where it makes sense to travel versus actually, what are things that can be done well virtually?', 'What we’ve been doing over the last year is quite frankly out of force because we’ve had lockdowns and various measures. But we’ll come out of it and find a balance, which allows us to spend more time making sure we get home in the evening or that we have a certain proportion of the week when we can base ourselves from home, but also which brings us back to some of those conversations and connections that are really important to innovate, excite, and work much more collaboratively with teams and with clients.', 'My rule of thumb or conclusion is that we’ve all found we can be extremely productive even in a virtual world. But it’s very difficult to also be able to do some of the things that call for greater innovation, inspiration, connection, relationship building in a purely virtual world. I’m hoping that we will come out of this into a much more blended sort of form that is the best of both worlds.', 'We’ve all found we can be extremely productive even in a virtual world. But it’s very difficult to also be able to do some of the things that call for greater innovation, inspiration, connection, relationship building in a purely virtual world.', 'Diane Brady: Achim, these kind of industry-gathering events, are they going to be less important in the physical world since we can kind of do them virtually?', 'Achim Berg: We’ve already seen that the role of the fashion shows has become less important than it used to be. In the old day, it was basically two times a year in each of those fashion cities to inspire, to produce some news, to produce pictures and stories for the media, and for the brands to communicate about the innovations and the new collections.', 'In the world of social media, two times a year multiplied by four or five cities is just not enough. We’ve seen that more storytelling was required. More occasions were required. And fashion shows, in a way, have only become one of many moments to create these stories.', 'But I think the industry needs to get together. It needs to exchange the same way as we need to exchange with our clients. A lot of ideas, a lot of opportunities are created through those kind of unplanned gatherings and discussions that we all have under those circumstances.', 'Using videoconference and telephone is efficient but also much more transactional. So I can’t wait to be back at the fashion shows. I can’t wait to be really back in the boardrooms of my clients. And hopefully, at least the second half of this year will get us there.', 'Anita Balchandani: The only thing I would add is that the bar on what would get us out of bed, I think, has risen, right? So we will absolutely take the time to [get ready] for important moments and special occasions.', 'But we will also start to question some of the other meetings and conversations that one might look back at and say were probably not that essential or didn’t quite require making that effort into traveling to.', 'Diane Brady: This push for social justice—whether it’s Black Lives Matter or just this understanding of embracing diversity—I’m curious around the extent to which this is influ\\xadencing your end of the business because fashion is as much a political statement as it is a personal style statement. Are you seeing that starting to influence conversations in any respect?', 'Achim Berg: It already has massively. Fashion is a mirror of culture, a mirror of what’s going on in the world. It’s also an expression of yourself and what you believe and what you want to make others see. So there’s always a translation of that into fashion and into style.', 'We also clearly see that social media and consumers are much more sensitive to those topics and want to see that reflected in the way brands act and present themselves. Sustainability, social justice, equality, all of those topics are highly relevant.', 'Diane Brady: We’re still in the middle of tough times right now. Anita, what advice do you give to people in the industry or even to individuals listening to this?', 'Anita Balchandani: It would be best summarized as, we’re certainly looking forward at a recovery trajectory. However, let’s not forget that the recovery isn’t going to be complete even this year, right? So we will continue to live with the virus and its consequences.', 'The key takeaway, if we think about the character\\xadistics and traits of those who have been, relatively speaking, more resilient through this period, is first, it will call for speed and responsive\\xadness, really staying tuned to where the consumer is heading, what matters, and how quickly players can respond and pivot around that.', 'Second, it’s really going to be about focus. Brands and players and individuals won’t win by spreading their efforts and attention everywhere. It will call for a particular focus on the channels and the markets and geographies that are going to drive this recovery. You have to be where the recovery is to ensure that you can stay ahead and win as part of this recovery.', 'And finally, it’s important to note that this recovery is going to come with a market-share redistribution. So the recovering tide is not going to lift every player. It’s going to lift the players that are better positioned and will end up gaining and distributing market share in their favor. So really thinking about what it is that it would take for you to be a winner in market-share terms as we come out of the recovery, that’s going to be an essential lens for companies to adopt.', 'Diane Brady: Great. Achim?', 'Achim Berg: Despite the fact that it’s all tough to live through this crisis, it’s also an amazing opportunity for this industry. And it was somehow overdue, yes? Because we all learned somewhat the hard way that this industry can innovate.', 'Think about how product has been developed in the last couple of months: very often from a kitchen table, much more digitized; using tools, not being with your factory; selling online, not in stores; building up new capabilities; being much more agile and flexible than we used to be.', 'We should make sure that a lot of those workarounds and new techniques become a new standard and a new reality. That will help to innovate the industry. We will always need fashion. So I’m not concerned about that. If the industry gets its act together, it will also continue to be successful in the future.', 'Diane Brady: Definitely. I’m looking forward to the day when I can wear something a little different from my athleisure. Anita Balchandani, Achim Berg, thank you very much for joining us.', 'Achim Berg: Thanks, Diane, for having us.', 'Anita Balchandani: It’s been a real pleasure, Diane. Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: Thank you to those of you who have been listening. If you’d like to find out more informa\\xadtion, please go to McKinsey.com.

33,Creating a more resilient and responsive government,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/creating-a-more-resilient-and-responsive-government,The pandemic has put demands on the public sector that are likely to increase.,"['The pandemic has put demands on the public sector that are likely to increase.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with Rima Assi and Tom Isherwood about the challenges and opportunities to strengthen government in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Governments worldwide are taking extraordinary measures to address the COVID-19 crisis, from shutting down borders to supporting individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. That’s creating unprecedented challenges and perhaps opportunities at all levels of government.', 'Joining me to talk about this are two partners in McKinsey’s Middle East office who have been working with officials on the front lines to help in building more resilient societies. Rima Assi is a senior partner who helps government leaders across the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe to create more competitive economies with more sustainable finances. Rima, welcome.', 'Rima Assi: Thank you, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: Tom Isherwood is a core leader in the public-sector practice, where he supports governments on topics related to economic development and technology. Tom, welcome.', 'Tom Isherwood: Thanks, Diane. Happy to be here.', 'Diane Brady: So let’s start with an overview of the impact. Rima, how deep is the damage?', 'Rima Assi: Diane, this is a very important question. The damage is significant. This is one of the most severe crises the world has seen. At the heart of it, this is a healthcare crisis that’s led to the loss of significant human lives. That’s spilled over into the economic sphere, where we are still facing the impact of that.', 'The impact of the pandemic has been very different across different countries. It’s different in terms of the healthcare outcome, but also in terms of the economic outcome. We’re seeing very different reactions from governments, and this will actually inform the recovery. This is why we’re interested at looking at resilience and how governments are thinking about that.', 'Diane Brady: Tom, just how does this become an opportunity for economic development, as opposed to the beginning of an economic depression?', 'Tom Isherwood: I think what we saw in 2020 was really just an unprecedented economic shock. What I think is more interesting is what’s happened after that. The economic condition today is really defined by uncertainty: uncertainty over how long it will take to get vaccines broadly distributed; uncertainty around whether governments will need to shut down; uncertainty around, when will consumer behavior start to bounce back in many ways, if ever? When will people start flying again? Will we start flying again the way we used to be flying?', 'This uncertainty has really made it very difficult for governments to plan. It’s made it very difficult for companies to plan their investments. It’s just made this entire situation quite difficult to navigate. And now, if you think about “What’s the opportunity here?”—the opportunity comes in looking for ways to reduce this uncertainty.', 'The more that governments can do to manage the spread of the virus so they don’t need to lock down again, the more that companies and governments can do to ensure that vaccine distribution happens rapidly, the sooner we will start to reduce the amount of uncertainty. That will enable governments and companies to start planning more effectively going forward. That’s the path out of this crisis.', 'Diane Brady: “Resilience” is a term that we’ve used in so many different contexts—climate change, the pandemic, etcetera. What does it mean in the context of governments and societies?', 'Rima Assi: I don’t think we ever spoke about resilience as much as we have in the past year. We started thinking of it in the context of what makes our societies resilient? That’s the heart of it, what everybody’s trying to achieve: resilience for individuals, for companies, and for government.', 'And what makes our societies resilient? We need resilient healthcare: How can we overcome the crisis? How can we create an environment where people can move in a safe manner, leveraging all technologies in place? There are so many other elements, too. How can we maintain education, which has been interrupted for a large part of the past year? How can we leverage technology? How can we maintain our livelihoods? How can we have economies that are resilient? How can we be resilient to supply-chain shocks? That’s a big part of how companies are changing in rethinking their supply chain.', 'As we think about those changes that governments are trying to support, how can they do it in a way that incorporates the long-term objectives of climate change, of equity? All of those components have to come together to have more resilient societies.', 'Diane Brady: There are certainly some lessons learned. Tom, what impact do you see the pandemic having on governments’ priorities in building further resilience?', 'Tom Isherwood: I think one of the biggest lessons for governments coming out of this is that resilience will be driven in a large part by technology. We’ve seen that in a couple of ways over this crisis. One way is simply in terms of the government workforce.', 'Agencies that were able to very quickly pivot to remote work were able to largely continue functioning. And the ones that weren’t had major disruptions. And so this is one way in which technology has enabled resilience in the face of this crisis.', 'Another way that this shows up is around what you were referring to: How do you actually run contactless government services? And what we’ve seen over the last nine, ten months is, just like in the private sector, COVID-19 has been a really huge impetus for governments to digitize rapidly. And what we’ve seen is, governments that previously had plans to take different services online in a matter of five years or ten years or 15 years, in some cases do this in just a matter of months.', 'Going forward, one of the things that will make governments more resilient in the face of potentially future crises like this is being able to take full advantage of technology and really deliver on contactless government. And that’s more than just putting government services online. Because what we find is that the first step is you put the government services online, but then you still actually need people to show up to verify their IDs. You need people to show up to sign something.', 'And so this goes beyond that. This goes to, how do I actually take full advantage of digital ID? How do I use that to enable you to do all of the things you need to do to interface with government, from your home if you have to. That may not be the mode that we run in on an ongoing basis. But to be able to be truly resilient in the face of another crisis like this, this will become mandatory for governments.', 'Going forward, one of the things that will make governments more resilient in the face of potentially future crises like this is being able to take full advantage of technology and really deliver on contactless government.', 'Diane Brady: Rima, so much of this has to do with fiscal health. How are officials dealing with the reality that they have less money coming in the door?', 'Rima Assi: Yes, indeed, governments have less money coming in through the doors, but they also have significantly more expenditures to support the healthcare efforts and to fund the stimulus programs that governments announced over the past year.', 'So our cumulative deficit globally is going to reach $30 trillion by 2023. This is unprecedented. I actually don’t think we’ve ever been able to imagine something like that. To put things into perspective, the stimulus [programs] that were announced during the past year are three to four times what was announced for the global financial crisis in 2008–09.', 'The fiscal challenge is going to be very big. At the same time, governments have to support their economies and their society. This is what we’re calling the great balancing act: at the moment, governments have issued a lot of debt to fund those outflows. But to issue a debt, [governments must also show] a credible investment history. It needs to have levers that give comfort to investors that growth will come to support payback.', 'Governments also have monetization plans that allow them to fund their increased liability. In our view, this is going to be the opportunity for governments to widen their abilities to manage their finances beyond the typical levers.', 'They’re going to have to start having the mindset of the investors, thinking about all the assets. How can they manage them in the best way so that they are maximizing returns? How can they have a greater transparency on their balance sheets?', 'Companies have balance sheets; countries should, too. So what are their sovereign balance sheets? How can they start thinking about net wealth versus purely income statement, and leveraging those insights to maximize returns for them, and therefore for their citizens?', 'The fiscal challenge is going to be very big. At the same time, governments have to support their economies and their society. This is what we’re calling the great balancing act: at the moment, governments have issued a lot of debt to fund those outflows.', 'Diane Brady: It’s a good point, actually. And I love the investment analogy there. Because we are at a time, Tom, when, in addition to the old rules not really necessarily applying, what makes it more so is that we are on the cusp of all these other factors, the digital revolution, the changing nature of work. What do we have to reimagine, especially from an economic standpoint, to get to where we need to go?', 'Tom Isherwood: Look, I think “reimagining” is one of these words that maybe has been overused. But I think that there’s quite a bit of it required, whether it’s on the economic front or whether it’s internally in how governments work just on their day-to-day functioning.', 'But if we stick with the economic side, I think that this crisis has really questioned the whole social contract between governments and companies in many countries. We saw really unprecedented measures take in, as Rima alluded to, a number of European governments essentially guaranteeing companies against losses. We saw a number of other countries that essentially put large kind of employment guarantees for citizens.', 'In all of it, we’ve even actually seen countries starting to talk about universal basic income in a very serious way, not just in a theoretical way. All of this would really just reshape the economic relationships between governments and their citizens and governments and the companies that are located there.', 'Diane Brady: Rima, as we’re in different time zones at the moment, as we record this my 15-year-old son is lying in his bed, his eyes apparently open, doing math. And remote learning certainly, at this length, has not worked out so well for students here in the US. And there’s a lot of discussion about education and how we have to really, going forward, unleash almost a learning revolution. Can you talk a bit more about that? Are the officials you work with trying to really focus on the education systems as an engine for recovery?', 'Rima Assi: Online education has been a savior in maintaining some level of learning for students. The hybrid model showed a lot of advantages, a lot of outreach, a lot of ability to reach the best teachers and the best insights globally, anywhere you are in the world.', 'It also showed some limitations when it came to the teamwork that is so important in these kids of the future and the competencies of the future generation. It also does not help emphasize all the skills of empathy, leadership that you want to develop in the future generation.', 'I wouldn’t be surprised if we wouldn’t evolve into a more advanced hybrid model where certain skills will be taught online. But there will be sessions in person, maybe when it comes to group work to experiment through projects.', 'Learning has become and is becoming more and more an imperative for everyone. It is not anymore for the students, the kids. It’s for each and every person in the society. We will be seeing more and more national learning programs.', 'That will open the doors for questions as to how do we evolve in a world where employees will apply for jobs and may have, on their CV [curriculum vitae], a series of curriculums that they followed, that they chose, that they designed? How will companies recognize that? That will be a very interesting innovation journey we’re going to be seeing.', 'Tom Isherwood: I think this imperative for everyone to kind of go through a bit of their own learning evolution is going to intensify. Before the crisis, there were a number of solutions on the market to essentially automate, through AI [artificial intelligence], call-center work.', 'But the uptake was really, really low. And what we saw in the first couple of months of the crisis is that during the lockdowns, a number of call centers, many of them changed how they worked and continued functioning, but some of them actually had to almost shut down. What replaced them were these solutions that had already been on the market but just didn’t have a lot of adoption. Some of them grew by ten or 12 times.', 'This is going to create real disruption in a lot of, let’s say, service jobs that could over time be replaced through AI and new technologies. That’s going to require many people in the labor market to reskill themselves and retool their skills so that they can find additional jobs when those ones go away.', 'Diane Brady: Because automation is permanent, right?', 'Tom Isherwood: Yes, that’s right. That’s not something that is going to go back to the way it was after this. This was something that was already happening. But the crisis has just been a massive accelerator of transitions like this one. We’re going to be feeling the aftereffects of this for years to come.', 'Diane Brady: It does get to not a question of politics, more just the reality of, the burden has been borne very differently at different levels of society, whether you’re a frontline worker. Certainly here in the US, Black and Hispanic Americans have borne the brunt both from the jobs and the health impact, which is kind of the societal fabric. What can we do on an objective level, Rima, to sort of rebuild that, just keep more cohesion as societies?', 'Rima Assi: Yes. This is indeed a very challenging societal problem. If you think about the type of job, be it frontline worker but also automatable or manual work, has been affected far more than desk jobs that would be done and conducted virtually from home.', 'If you also think about gender, it has been proven that women lost jobs far more than men. In recent reviews and surveys we’ve conducted, women have 1.8 times more chances to lose their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 crisis than men.', 'So indeed, certain discrepancies and inequalities that we’ve been working hard over the past years to try to bridge are going to be unfortunately accentuated. And while there’s no one lever that’ll be the magical solution, we believe governments and societies are becoming more and more aware of discrepancies and will have to put more effort—more effort in learning, more effort in reintegration, more effort in support. The role of the private sector and the government tier will become critical.', 'Diane Brady: We talk about capabilities building a lot in companies, Tom. How does it apply to the public sector? What capabilities do they need that perhaps maybe haven’t been as emphasized in the past?', 'Tom Isherwood: Look, I think the last year has really put a spotlight on areas where the public sector needs to build capabilities faster. The first one is around data, analytics, technology. In this space, this is driven just by the kinds of decisions that governments needed to make. They went from having decision cycles that often, in many cases, take years to having to make some of those same decisions in a matter of weeks.', 'This is actually something that is, in some ways, a good thing. We’ve actually done a study over multiple years in the private sector looking at companies. And the highest-performing companies make decisions significantly faster than other companies in their sectors, whether it’s around budgeting, whether it’s around people reallocation.', 'This crisis forced governments to actually move a bit in the same direction and start making those decisions a lot faster. But to make decisions fast, you need good data. To have good data, you need to have the right technology in place. You need to have the right people to analyze the data.', 'That requires new capabilities and new skills, not just in the data scientists or the technologists that you hire, but also in pretty much everybody else who has to make use of that data in their day-to-day job to actually be able to make better decisions and serve its citizens better.', 'To make decisions fast, you need good data. To have good data, you need to have the right technology in place. You need to have the right people to analyze the data.', 'This is definitely one area where there’s a real uplift needed in capabilities in most governments. This will be a challenge because many private sectors struggle with these same skill sets. But that’s one very important area.', 'The other thing I would say, and this is more of an institutional capability, not necessarily just about individuals, is I think that this crisis has also put a spotlight on how governments need to think of new ways to partner with the private sector and new ways to partner with social institutions.', 'Tom Isherwood: So let me give you a few examples. If we look at the way that the whole vaccine race has unfolded, this has required governments to do things they would never do. This has required governments to make bets on essentially purchasing large amounts of doses of vaccines that are not even approved. But doing that is a way of offsetting the risk for companies, to be able to incentivize companies to do something they wouldn’t do normally.', 'This has created an environment where to be able to actually do what’s right for society, you have to work with private companies differently as a government. You have to kind of work with your people differently. The kinds of requests and impositions the governments have put on people, asking them to stay home for months at a time, this is not the normal way that these things work.', 'Whether it’s about actually signing agreements with companies, whether it’s about more effective communication to every citizen, how government interfaces with its stakeholders and forges partnerships is also an area where there’s just a real need to improve.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s go back a second to the role of technology, because I’d like to synthesize how important it’s been in both the recovery and how important it’s going to be going forward in terms of building resilience, Tom.', 'Tom Isherwood: Yes. Look, there is no doubt that the crisis has accelerated the adoption of technology. It has reinforced the importance of technology for governments to become truly resilient. It has really put a lot of momentum behind this agenda in pretty much every government I talk to. Every government official that I talk to sees technology as one of their top one or two priorities now. Everybody would have said it’s important. But that level of prioritization was not the case a year ago.', 'The other thing we’re seeing is people moving beyond the kind of, let’s say, experimentation phase. What we’ve seen over the last couple of decades is that governments have started to adopt technology, but it’s been a bit haphazard. Many government institutions have an app. Many government institu\\xadtions have 20 apps. And many of those apps are not good, not connected with each other, overlapping.', 'This crisis is forcing people who think about these topics in government to also think about doing them differently. How can you really introduce technology in a way that actually improves citizens’ journeys in terms of how they interact with government, whether they want to buy a home and interact with all the bureaucracy they need to do that? How can you actually make that simpler? Whether they want to open a business, whether they want to get a passport, whatever it is.', 'Try to solve for real citizen challenges. That requires also taking a hard look and consolidating some of what’s been done over the last couple years and eliminating some of what’s happened the last couple of decades. I just think we’re on the cusp of a really important moment for governments as they take a new look at their technology with a really new level of priority.', 'Diane Brady: So, Rima, that seems to apply a much higher level of agility on the part of public servants.', 'Rima Assi: Totally. Public servants have to go through changes and experiments in a matter of weeks that they have been talking about or interested in for years. The remote work, the digitization of processes, the leveraging of digital tools and platforms for everything that had to do with meetings, communication, signatures has been unparalleled.', 'That agility was a matter of needs during the lockdowns in the middle of the crisis, because we had lack of resources and competencies in certain areas and significant needs in others. We’ve seen many countries and governments starting to experiment by, for example, moving front service desk employees that wouldn’t be working because of the closures to support on call centers, to support on online remote support, as much as their skills allowed.', 'The way we’ve designed and thought about governments in the past was informed by legacy and how we saw the world, but also the technology that we had available. This is going to be the opportunity for individuals to become far more agile and to do a variety of different things, but also for institutions of governments to evolve.', 'Diane Brady: Are we going to be seeing government become a more attractive place to work, given the role and the power it has? And does it basically bring in a new or wider pool of individuals?', 'Tom Isherwood: Look, that’s a good question. Without a doubt, this year has really reinforced the importance of government getting its job right. For many people, that will be attractive. That will be exciting. That will be something people will want to be part of. But I don’t necessarily think that this is going to change how job seekers look at governments overall.', 'Diane Brady: It’s more like the public- and private-sector partnerships, then. Perhaps that’s where we see that level of innovation come into play.', 'Tom Isherwood: What this has done is it’s reinforced that it doesn’t matter what sector you’re in in the private sector. But no matter what sector you’re in, what government does matters a lot for you. That was always the case in some sectors, like in pharmaceuticals or in defense or in other heavily regulated sectors. Oil and gas is another one.', 'All the companies in those sectors have always thought a lot about government relations, and how do they think through what’s going to happen on regulations. But this year has showed us that it doesn’t matter what sector you’re in. You could be in fashion, and you could be in retail. You could be in travel and logistics. The actions the governments have taken this year have just fundamentally altered the landscape in those sectors.', 'This will require, going forward, a greater degree of coordination, a greater degree of communication from governments, and also, like we mentioned in the article we wrote on resilience, a different form of partnership between the private sector and governments.', 'There’s a real dialogue right now going on in the private sector, corporate America, but also globally around corporate purpose. More than just shareholder returns, how can companies contribute to improving the societies in which they operate?', 'There is a real opportunity in intersection between this new focus on corporate purpose and the increasing needs that society has that government will struggle to fulfill by itself. I can’t help but be a bit optimistic that there ought to be an opportunity there for forward-thinking companies and for agile governments to find a way to actually do something that is better for society.', 'Diane Brady: Rima, there’s also been a lot of discussion around inclusion and diversity. I know you’ve done a lot of work in that area, even prior to the pandemic. What do you see there?', 'Rima Assi: Yes, indeed, diversity and inclusion is a very important priority. It has been. The importance of it gets exacerbated by certain events that make us all realize that despite all the effort, we have still a much longer way to go. And we still have significant gaps.', 'This is going to be a very important priority. We’re seeing it become paramount for governments. Because for their societal development, they’re realizing the gap between certain segments of the society cannot continue.', 'Diversity and inclusion is a very important priority. It has been. The importance of it gets exacerbated by certain events that make us all realize that despite all the effort, we have still a much longer way to go.', 'People that are working in manual jobs, the level of education, where do they live? What is their gender identity? That is going to actually become, as we’re thinking about partnership—public–private partnership but also partnership with societies—the way forward. The hope is and the will is that such diversity turns into further inclusion and helps us all achieve a better outcome.', 'Diane Brady: To close off, let’s just bring it back to the individual. Because we’re all looking at our governments. We’re all worried and nervous, maybe optimistic about the future. Or what would you say to individuals in terms of the possibilities here? I’m going to start with you, Tom.', 'Tom Isherwood: At the end of the day, everything we’re talking about comes down to the individual level. The economic impact we talked about manifests in terms of people who have lost their jobs and people who struggle to make ends meet.', 'The response of governments that we’ve talked about comes down to people or individuals who either got the services that they needed from governments—and over this last year, a lot of that was around healthcare—or they didn’t. And that has real consequences for individuals.', 'What the last year has really shown is that what government does really matters. The difference between good government and bad government makes a big difference in our lives.', 'Diane Brady: Rima, help us see around the corner a bit. What’s the message to individuals?', 'Rima Assi: Individual points of views, actions, and behaviors matter. What we say and what we do has a far bigger impact now than years back. Because technology supports and maximizes our reach.', 'Therefore, for us to be relevant and for us to have an impact, we need to continuously think and balance economy, society, and helping others, but also invest in oneself. Because to maintain our relevance and our ability to help each other, we need to continue to invest in our competencies. The journey ahead is one of hope, but one of higher requirements on investing in our capabilities.', 'Diane Brady: Great. I can’t think of a better way to end than right there with hope. Rima and Tom, thank you very much for joining us.', 'Rima Assi: Thank you, Diane.', 'Tom Isherwood: Thanks a lot, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: And thank you and the audience for joining us. Obviously, this is a big conversation to be continued. If you’d like to read more about rethinking resilience and the priorities for governments, do go to McKinsey.com.

34,Creating a postpandemic recovery for women in the workplace,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/creating-a-postpandemic-recovery-for-women-in-the-workplace,COVID-19 has pushed working women to the point where many have dropped out. Here’s how companies can help.,"['COVID-19 has pushed working women to the point where many have dropped out. Here’s how companies can help.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with McKinsey senior partners Alexis Krivkovich and Lareina Yee about the devastating impact of COVID-19 on working women and how employers can help make the new normal sustainable. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Working women have long been accustomed to the idea of a double shift, and working remotely has driven that home. As I was preparing for this interview today, my son needed help with his homework. Another child had a, quote, “fiscal emergency” at college. There was the dog, the meals to plan, things to do and, of course, like many of you, my day job. And I’m far from alone. Today, we’re going to talk about the state of women in corporate America and speak with two co-founders of what is the largest study of women in corporate America. Joining me are Lareina Yee, a senior partner and McKinsey’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. Lareina, welcome.', 'Lareina Yee: Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: And Alexis Krivkovich, senior partner who leads McKinsey’s San Francisco office and the company’s fintech practice in North America. Alexis, nice to have you here.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Thanks for having me.', 'Diane Brady: Lareina, let’s start with you. Give us a quick roundup of this year’s results. It’s now in its sixth year. What changed?', 'Lareina Yee: What changed is how women are experiencing work. And what we find is that we are at a crossroads that I didn’t expect us to be on. One in four women are considering stepping out or stepping back from the workplace.', 'And that is a shocking number: one in four. It’s millions of women considering this. Now, certainly, all of these women haven’t acted on that. But the fact that they’re considering it is something we’ve never seen in the previous six years of the research.', 'And, in fact, in all other years when we did this research, one of the myths that we felt that we had busted is that women are leaving at greater rates than men. In fact, what we saw at every company and across all industries (and across corporate America) was that attrition between men and women was equivalent. But this year, with how COVID has reshaped the workplace, that is actually different.', 'It’s really important to note that there are three substories in here. It’s certainly a working mom story, as you said in your introduction. But that’s not exclusively the challenge. We also saw a really acute challenge for senior women, whether they had children or not, and Black women.', 'The biggest message here is that we are at this moment near a precipice where we may actually lose the hard-earned gains that we’ve been working on in corporate America, or we may continue to go down a path where we see more quality in the workplace.', 'Diane Brady: I’m curious what’s prompting senior women to leave during a time like this. Alexis, what have you found?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: What we hear and see from senior women is this sense of exhaustion and this feeling of burnout like they always have to be on; like the responsibilities have magnified in ways that are really profound. And the lack of boundaries and expectations of when you’re in the office, when the offices come to you, has become particularly challenging for them. This is especially critical because it’s not just the senior women, themselves, that we’re worried about. It’s the impact they have broadly on diversity and inclusion in their workplace environments.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s define that for people in terms of what it means to be senior in the context of this study.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Sure. So, we think about the talent pools in three broad categories. We think about early-tenure women at the front lines and in individual contributor roles: early management and early leadership. These are often the first management positions or even the second management positions, like a senior manager or director level.', 'Then we think about senior leadership: everything from VP up through the C-suite and top executive ranks in companies. The importance of these communities, particularly senior women, is that the proportion of women we have in the pipeline at senior levels is still quite low, relative to our aspiration of equity. We start with 47 percent women. But by the time we get to the C-suite, we’re down to one in five.', 'Diane Brady: And we have been making progress in that area, right, Lareina?', 'Lareina Yee: We had. Over the last couple of years, we’d seen some real payoff of the efforts that companies were making. We were seeing an increase from, say, 16 or 17 percent to 20 or 22 percent of those senior women, the people who report straight up to the CEO and are the SVPs and EVPs of organizations, for various industries.', 'Even though that doesn’t sound like a huge difference, it is. When you have two, three, four members of your top team that are women, it signals something completely different. For the women who are working their way up through the ranks, “if she can see it, she can be it” is the motto that I’ve heard so many people say. What that is saying is, “I’m looking for a role model.” But it also changes the quality of business management. Diversity actually improves business performance.', 'So, even though we think of this as individual stories of women and the type of opportunities we want to create, it shouldn’t be lost on companies that this is actually good business as well. We saw globally, across companies, a 34 percent higher return on equity from management teams that had diverse members on that team. Gender diversity, racial diversity, and underrepresented voices are a part of the team making decisions.', 'Diane Brady: On a personal level, does this resonate with both of you? Alexis, what you’re hearing from senior women, does it sound familiar to you during this pandemic?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Absolutely. The senior women phenomenon is one of many points of intersection. Senior women are very likely to feel and experience being “onlys,” meaning they’re representing and are the only one of their kind in the interactions. And that’s important because it comes with a lot of extra responsibility that is placed on them.', 'And I think many of us feel in this moment not just a sense of we’re trying to keep the ship moving in our own household, in whatever configuration that is; in many cases, senior women are more likely to be mothers. That’s certainly the case in my house with three kids running around.', 'But now, increasingly, we’re also caretakers for our office, our community, a virtual culture. We’re trying to represent all of the women out there that we want to see advance to join us in the senior ranks. But we’re also playing roles, in many cases, of new hobbies like virtual school principal.', 'I spend a lot of time wiping down groceries with disinfectant; all these things that were never part of our day job or our night job have been added to the plate. For many senior women, it’s just an extremely intense moment to put all those pieces together.', 'Lareina Yee: Diane, it’s worth noting that all those extra jobs that Alexis has taken on—chief disinfectant officer, chief virtual school officer, personal chef to her three children—are to the tune of three hours a day of extra work.', 'You mentioned the double shift. The double shift was not three hours a day on top of a full-time work schedule before. If you happen to be both a working mom and a senior woman, you feel enormous amounts of pressure.', 'When you look at the data, the reaction from a lot of working moms and senior moms is, well, that may explain why I’m exhausted. That may explain why it’s not just me but, around me, we see much higher rates of burnout. What you worry about is if you were just sprinting for a couple of weeks at the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of people said, OK, my head will go down and I’ll do the right thing. But when you’re living that way for a year or more, that is just not a sustainable way to build culture and work.', 'Diane Brady: So, it’s not an empty threat, the idea that women will leave?', 'Lareina Yee: Well, I don’t think it’s an empty threat. I also don’t think the load is equally shared. One of my favorite statistics is that 77 percent of men think that they carry the load equally at home. And I do think a lot of men are carrying quite a bigger load.', 'However, only 40 percent of moms agree that that’s taking place. So, you still don’t have a shared space outside of work for all those extra things that have to be done. When women work three hours a day on top of whatever their day is, for weeks at a time, and they often take on more of the responsibilities in the office in addition to the business-performance results that are expected to be delivered, and if someone feels this is pretty intense, there’s a reason for that.', 'Diane Brady: What advice do you have right now for leaders who do want more gender equity, who are dealing with a whole host of issues?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: The first piece we have to think about is how are we going to make this new normal sustainable. As Lareina said, many of us thought, we hoped, this [pandemic] was maybe a sprint, and it’s really become a marathon. For companies, that requires thinking much more broadly about their responsibility for the whole human and the whole health of their employees, not just to ensure productivity but to ensure sanity for people in this extraordinary moment.', 'Are we rethinking as leaders of companies? Are we rethinking the expectations about what is truly sustainable as this becomes more of a medium- to long-term phenomenon of having people working virtually, facing some of the disconnects and support that would enable them to focus on their work environment?', 'The second piece of that is, do we have a set of new norms around what allows us to set boundaries and what’s appropriate to enable the flexibility that’s possible here to actually be achieved? A lot of what we hear is that folks are saying, great, I don’t have to commute anymore.', 'It’s terrible that at any given moment of any hour of the day, across any time zone, you feel you can reach me, and I don’t feel like I have the control to say yes or no. [It’s important to set] some reasonable boundaries for people about simple things: when do meetings occur, responsiveness to emails, time on and time off.', 'We have to extend that (and those boundaries) into the structural places. People are feeling a sense of pressure and stress and concern about the criteria that are being used to evaluate them, the expectations or the lack of clarity about those expectations.', 'Companies are going to have to take that tricky topic head on and think about the playbook for sustaining culture, for creating sponsorship and feedback, for ensuring that bias does not get into the system. That playbook is, for many companies, mostly a physical location playbook; meaning it was born and developed for an environment where you had the opportunity to manage these things in the office setting. Increasingly, we have to rewrite that playbook for this virtual moment. That’s going to take a different set of tools and a different way to approach a number of these topics.', 'Diane Brady: Lareina, what are you telling CEOs?', 'Lareina Yee: It is how do you run the marathon, not the sprint. There are two things that I would call attention to. One is, invest in women. So, investments matter. A third of companies told us this year that they are thinking about scaling back (or already have scaled back) their diversity and inclusion programs. At this point in time, I can’t understand why you would do that.', 'The second thing is that only 50 percent of companies said that they were increasing their programs and investments around things like mental health and support for working parents. Given what we’ve just talked about, again, it seems strange that only half of the companies are investing in these two areas.', '[In addition,] invest in the talent you have. This is a moment where you do not want to lose the women that you have. Invest in their talent. Women are equally, if not more, ambitious to become leaders. That’s a positive level ambition.', 'We know that when a workplace is fair, and we know when women have sponsors who bring up opportunities for them to professionally advance and to flourish, they do better and they’re more likely to want to stay. My question back for anyone who’s leading a team is, “How are you supporting with opportunities the women on your team today?” It takes us back to something we’ve talked a lot about over the years but becomes ever more important, which is, “Are you overmentoring and undersponsoring, or are you truly sponsoring women to succeed?”', 'Diane Brady: Now, what does that mean, overmentoring and undersponsoring? It’s an intriguing concept.', 'Lareina Yee: Well, so, mentoring is fantastic. It is friendship, affinity, empathy. All of us, as human beings, need that. But the difference is sponsorship takes it one level up. Sponsorship is providing professional opportunities.', 'The types of tactical behaviors, if you have a sponsor (or really, you should have a pit crew of sponsors to advance professionally in the work world), would be do you have a manager or someone senior who’s helping you see around the corner, above and beyond what you’re doing.', 'Is someone betting on your potential, bringing you to a meeting, letting you present, giving you some of those high-profile, project opportunities where you’re going to increase your visibility, helping you expand your network, helping you with a promotion, helping you understand your feedback?', 'One of the things we saw in previous years was that, oftentimes, whether they were women or male managers, [they] were more tentative, more hesitant to give women negative feedback. But negative feedback is also what helps you grow professionally. It helps you learn to be better.', 'Diane Brady: It’s so much harder, isn’t it, Alexis, in terms of the remote environment that we’re talking about? It feels more transactional. And in terms of building networks, I think about some of the elements of the study that really get into what Black women are experiencing, for example, and the particular types of isolation there.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Absolutely. So, we’ve talked about these challenges are not borne equally across men and women. While everybody is struggling, there’s still a bigger burden to bear. But they’re also not borne equally across all groups of women. And Black women have the most challenging time in the workplace environment, full stop.', 'This existed well before the pandemic. In fact, our research has shown consistently that, structurally, Black women don’t advance at the proportional rate they should relative to all other groups. So, take that at the very first opportunity for advancement into the first manager position which, in fact, is the most inequitable across men and women; something we describe as the broken rung, meaning that very first launch forward is, in fact, the one that’s least fair across men and women.', 'Diane Brady: That’s, what, four years? How far into one’s career does the broken rung come into play?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Well, it varies a lot across sectors and particular job roles. But you can imagine, for many people, this is anywhere from three to six years into their career. It’s a first chance to go from an individual contributor into a manager role.', 'Not everyone is kind of seeking that out at the same moment or with the same opportunity. But it really is what sets up the talent pipeline for the future. In the current context, for every 100 men who leap forward into that manager position, only 85 women do. But most importantly, only 58 Black women do.', 'Fifty-eight: that’s almost half the level of initial advancement, which sets up a slower path to opportunity for Black women all the way through. So, we start with structural bias and inequity that is holding Black women back. But then in the context of this moment and the pandemic, there are so many other levels of complexity added to that.', 'So, Black women today are three times more likely to report that they’re navigating through the death of a loved one in the context of COVID. They feel far less comfortable sharing that grief in their workplace environment. They’re twice as likely to say they don’t feel like they have the allies and supports they need to really advance.', 'When you link back to some of what Lareina was describing on mentorship and the importance of sponsorship, even before you get to sponsorship, not only do they not feel like they’re represented (because they are not fairly represented in the work\\xadplace), but they don’t feel like they are heard and supported by those around them. And that’s a really critical issue because imagine what that means in terms of how much of your path and your progression you then feel like you tackle on your own.', 'Diane Brady: Well, and there are other differences as well. Lareina, I know this is something you’ve thought about a lot, yourself.', 'Lareina Yee: Well, the most heart-wrenching story is the lack of equity for Black women. But certainly for other women of color, for women with disabilities, for LGBTQ+, we see that same drop-off of experience; less support, less advancement.', 'Forty-five percent of women of color report that they experience being the only. And Alexis mentioned this as well, but being the only is the experience (that’s all too common) where you enter a room and you’re the only one. You may be the only woman and the only woman of color.', 'What that does to you is a couple of things. One is, it gives you an intense feeling of isolation with an intense responsibility, at the same time, to try and positively represent the stereotypes of your racial group or of your affinity group or of your gender.', 'That’s on top of trying to actually do what you’re there to do, which is to present a business case, move a decision, et cetera. It’s an enormous amount of pressure that’s being put on a person, day in and day out. On top of that, women of color are much more likely to experience microaggressions, those type of demeaning remarks where you are judged to be younger or less authoritative in your capabilities.', 'One of the questions we’ve asked, time and time again, is does your manager question your work? If your work is questioned, does your manager defend your work? We find that Latina women and Black women are less likely to get that type of basic, day-to-day support.', 'Diane Brady: Is that an area where we had seen progress over the last six years, prior to the pandemic?', 'Lareina Yee: Well, I think we’ve seen overall progress at the top for women. I don’t think we’ve seen as fast or as great a progress for women of color. And that’s why sometimes it’s important to look at intersectionality, which is essentially looking at the intersection of race and of gender, because the experience can be quite different.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: The importance of inter\\xadsectionality is looking at the confluence of more than one factor of diversity that an individual holds. So, it’s often being both a woman and a person of color in the workplace. It’s being LGBTQ and also female. It’s these factors that rest on top of each other.', 'And they’re really important in this context because what we see (not surprisingly) is that there’s not just one experience for women in the workplace. There’s myriad experiences. And the reality is, any element of intersectionality (so, any element of otherness that you add to your workplace experience) where you diverge from the most common (which currently is being a white male) compounds the effects that we see of these challenges in different ways.', 'And so, let’s take race. In the context of race, we talked about the broken rung where 100 men leap forward to the first promotion but only 85 women. Well, that’s not the same experience across women. For Latina women, that’s 71. And for Black women, that’s 58.', 'Another example of this is in the context of having to be an “only” in the workplace environment. Being an only is important because they are situations where you show up and you are the only one like you there. And what comes with that is not only trying to show up and do your best as an individual business leader but feeling an immense sense of pressure and responsibility to represent all of the people like you.', 'So, women in general experience being an only far more than men. But nearly half of Black women say they regularly have the experience of being an only; similarly for LGBTQ women. These are experiences that are far more frequent, and they bring with them more structural challenge and more friction in the workplace that is real, that translates over time into less opportunity to advance.', 'Diane Brady: Lareina, I want to ask about the genesis of this study. What motivated you to start this?', 'Lareina Yee: We weren’t making any progress. We were stuck. I grew up thinking that things were more equal, like many women. Thinking that, OK, maybe it’s particularly hard when the kids are little, but as I become more senior, it’s going to get easier, and the women I started with will be right there next to me.', 'I remember, about ten years ago, being really excited to become a partner at McKinsey and realizing that I was oftentimes adding to the diversity just by walking into the room because there were no other women between my clients and even at the firm, or certainly women of color. The genesis for me (on a personal level) was how can we understand this better. Because if we put the facts on the table, and if we break it apart in pieces that we can solve, and if we put our business hats on, we can solve anything.', 'Corporate America has the capacity to do better. That flashlight, which shines brighter and brighter every year, of being able to see where we are and to be unafraid of that and say, OK, now let’s work on what we would do differently and making sure that this is not a seasonal commitment.', 'A lot of companies, when I first started looking at this, it felt like they were doing one-and-done programs. And that’s just not the way cultural transformation works. And so, for me, I think it’s very personal. I would love to see more gender equity. But I also want to make sure we put a business context and set solutions around that. And instead of just observing the problem, I want it to be part of the solution.', 'Diane Brady: Alexis, what have you learned over the six years that this study has been going on?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Let me share two. The first thing that struck me was the sensation we had that something wasn’t working right and something far deeper (unintended but really structural) was at play in creating an unlevel playing field at work.', 'The very first year we did the report, we said, everyone has this sense that this is generational, and the time will come, and just wait and be patient. But does the data actually tell us that? We looked at the data, and we ran the numbers.', 'We said, well, how long will it take at this rate to get parity in the C-suite? How long do we have to wait to get to equity? The answer was 100 years. I thought, OK, my children’s children’s children. I have three daughters. I don’t know how long I can live to see this through.', 'It felt both deeply devastating and really confirming of what so many of us were feeling. Something is going wrong and we’re not intending it, but it’s the outcome we’re getting. We’ve got to get underneath and dig in to understand what it is so we can fix it. I mean, no one’s going to want to wait three, four generations to see this solved.', 'Diane Brady: How do you fix perceptions? I mean, do you feel, Lareina, that the perceptions have changed? Even the gatekeepers, especially at those senior levels, do tend to be white men who may not knowingly be sexist but may not recognize excellence in a form that isn’t familiar to themselves.', 'Lareina Yee: Yes, I do think we are seeing change. Now, broadly across every company in corporate America, and someone listening to this may be saying, that’s not my lived experience, and I would say it is not universal. So, we are seeing pockets. We are seeing some companies, some industries, track a little bit faster. Those are the bright spots you mentioned.', 'There wasn’t language and data in a way to explain any of this before. We weren’t talking about “onlys.” We weren’t talking about microaggressions. Academics fully understood that these were cultural barriers. But it wasn’t as commonplace in the workplace, in corporate America, to talk about this.', 'Every year, there will be a couple of moments where we’re sharing our findings with groups of women. And someone will come up to me and say, “Thank you for putting words and numbers against my experience. Thank you for helping me realize I’m not crazy, this is not just me experiencing it, and also giving me some very tangible things I can do to be a better supporter of other women or, if I’m a male leader, how I can actually bridge that gap between intent and results.”', 'It’s good that companies are impatient. They’re impatient for change. They’re impatient for results. That’s a healthy tension to have. Our concern, this year, is that we may have a significant step backwards, which will make that 100 years all the more elusive.', 'Diane Brady: Is there, Alexis, any good that can come out of this? Flexibility was one of the things that women did list as being a key component of what they felt was holding them back. How do we turn this into a moment of positive change?', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Oh, absolutely. The silver lining here is certainly that we have injected into the system a degree of extreme experimentation with flexibility that we’ve never seen before, nor ever would’ve thought was possible. It was born out of a humanitarian and health crisis, but what it has created is an experiment that has companies saying, we will never go back.', 'That’s really profound and something that we can capture in a very positive way. And what we mean by we can never go back is 93 percent of companies are saying, we anticipate more flexibility in our workplace environment and allowing people to work from home, sourcing talent from different places, than we did in the past.', 'We anticipate less business travel. We anticipate the ability for people to work from different locations. And that’s hugely important because the number-one thing women stated in the past would make a difference to them in being able to remain competitive and thrive in the workplace was greater flexibility.', 'So, if we can solve for this, if we can harness this moment and gain that positive piece out of it, while solving for all of the issues right now that sit around it because we’re operating in a pandemic, things like a lack of consistent childcare and eldercare, the increased workload and stress associated with a health crisis that’s happening around us—if we can solve for those elements and ride through them, on the other side, you can imagine unleashing a level of flexibility that really allows women to thrive.', 'Diane Brady: Alexis, talk a little bit about what you’ve learned that you’ve adapted in your own behaviors for your career, as a leader.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: The greatest reflection for me has been how am I, myself, adapting my personal playbook to meet this moment. The piece I worry most about are those informal elements of connectivity and things that build support over time toward sponsorship that would’ve otherwise, hopefully, occurred in micromoments in the work\\xadplace environment that now have to be thoughtfully recrafted in this virtual world. We already know they’re not distributed equally in the workplace, that women don’t receive as many of those interactions and that support, and, in particular, women of color. But it’s especially at risk in this moment.', 'Sixty-three percent of employees say they feel they are allies to women of color. But when you ask the specific questions about behaviors underneath that, that would suggest that they’re supporting women, are they listening to the stories for women of color, that number drops to 41 percent.', 'Are they taking a public stand on racial equity? That number drops to 29 percent. Do they personally mentor or sponsor a woman of color? 10 percent. That’s a profoundly lower execution rate on our aspiration. The biggest reflection has been how can I make sure in my own actions I don’t just say I want to be these things, but I show up in my daily moments to be those things.', 'And then how do I get those around me, maybe those with less awareness, including male colleagues and others who don’t have that shared experience to draw upon, to realize that they, too, need to ensure that they’re actually making those moments happen?', 'Diane Brady: Lareina, what about you?', 'Lareina Yee: I think this concept of work–life balance just has been busted, because there are no formal boundaries between work and your personal life when you’re working from home. The silver lining in that is we need to redefine what that looks like. One of the things that we will get to do, going forward out of this pandemic, is define work that’s flexible, that allows us the benefits. But right now, we’re getting all the flexibility without any of the benefits.', 'How do we reconstruct how we work so that life is not a trade-off? You’re not sitting there deciding between your job and your children, but that all of that is actually one thing that you’re working toward, and that you can be as ambitious as you are in your career aspirations as in your personal and family aspirations. I hope that’s one piece that comes out of what has been an incredibly tough year for so many Americans and so many people around the world and workforce.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: It’s the end of a long, long, long day with no boundaries. Like a day where my children, despite the sign that said, “Do not enter for any reason, no matter what,” came in here three times during this.', 'Lareina Yee: Oh, yes, I had someone check in as well. It was so funny. One more thing. For companies, as you think about leadership beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and when you think about how we steer our companies, so much of the emphasis is on delivering performance results. Out of this research, I hope more and more companies are saying what about also delivering our cultural results at the same level.', 'Diane Brady: Lareina, Alexis, thank you for joining us.', 'Alexis Krivkovich: Thank you.', 'Lareina Yee: Thank you for having us.', 'Diane Brady: That was Lareina Yee, senior partner, McKinsey’s chief diversity and inclusion officer out of San Francisco, and Alexis Krivkovich, senior partner who leads the San Francisco office, and the company’s fintech practice in North America.

35,Investing in Black economic mobility,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/investing-in-black-economic-mobility,Racial equity and inclusive growth can drive economic mobility and a postpandemic recovery.,"['Racial equity and inclusive growth can drive economic mobility and a postpandemic recovery.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with partner Shelley Stewart III  about the economic benefits of closing the racial wealth gap, leading the new McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, and strategies to promote racial equity. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Today we are speaking with McKinsey partner Shelley Stewart. He is a leader in our Private Equity & Principal Investors Practice, helping clients on growth topics, and now he serves as a leader of the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility. Shelley, welcome.', 'Shelley Stewart: Thank you so much for having me.', 'Diane Brady: So why are we starting this?', 'Shelley Stewart: The history of racial disparity and systematic inequality has been long-studied and well-known in the United States, and it has been brought into particularly sharp focus over the last six months, both in the context of the disproportionate impact on Black Americans of COVID-19 and with respect to some of the social-justice issues that we are all facing and discussing as a nation.', 'These challenges are relevant in the US, and they’re relevant around the world. As part of our remit, we as a firm have long taken the opportunity to partner with our clients across sectors, and around the world, on issues that are particularly tough. So we believe that we have a place to help on this particularly tough, and what some would even call “intractable,” issue.', 'Diane Brady: There’s something almost audacious about coming out and saying Black economic mobility. When these issues are discussed, it’s often under an umbrella term, like financial inclusion. Was there a reason why you felt it was important to see it directly through a racial lens?', 'Shelley Stewart: Absolutely. First and foremost, we know that this issue of mobility does not impact only Black Americans. But we have seen in the data that Black Americans in particular face staggering inequality that is only matched in some instances by the Native American population, at least in the US.', 'So we wanted to be very precise about the group that we were trying to impact. On the economic-mobility front, you hit the nail on the head. We wanted to be very clear about what the end goal was, which is to help Black Americans increase their mobility in places where they faced stagnant mobility for generations.', 'The goal: “to help Black Americans increase their mobility in places where they faced stagnant mobility for generations.”', 'Diane Brady: As you say, these are issues we’ve seen for many generations. What’s changed? Are you hopeful?', 'Shelley Stewart: I am hopeful. But I think that many folks who are not as close to the history and the data assume that more progress has been made than is actually the case over the last, call it, 150 years. So certainly, if you take the lens of Black Americans descending from slaves, and the economic conditions associated with that, one would say yes, we have made progress today.', 'If you fast forward and you look at some of the educational gains that came around and accelerated after Brown v. Board of Education, the data is quite clear that educational attainment has improved for Black Americans. So we should celebrate that.', 'That being said, if you look at many of the measures of economic wellbeing, whether it is income or wealth, there are huge gaps that have persisted—and over various periods of time, even grown. You take wealth, for example. Today, or at least as of 2016, the median net worth of Black families was one-tenth that of white families. So from that perspective and that lens, we have not made substantial progress, and there’s a lot of work to do.', 'Diane Brady: You’ve done a lot of work on Black-owned businesses. What are you doing specifically through the institute?', 'Shelley Stewart: Black-owned businesses and business ownership and entrepreneurship in general are a critical wealth driver. And as we know, small and medium-size businesses are also our job-growth engine here in the United States.', 'The opportunity to increase the number of Black-owned businesses is substantial. Today Black-owned businesses comprise only 2.1 percent of US employer firms while Black Americans make up more than 13.0 percent of the population. This gap is an incredible impediment to wealth for Black Americans on the whole.', 'Even where we have businesses, we know that there’s a certain level of fragility that’s being exposed, for example, by the pandemic. At the outset of the pandemic, we wrote an article, “Investing in Black lives and livelihoods,” where we identified that about 40 percent to 50 percent of Black-owned businesses were in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy when it comes to the pandemic.', 'That’s before you even adjust for size and revenue and access to credit and some other challenges. So we’re trying to take all the challenges head-on, from how do we get more Black entrepreneurs at the front end of the funnel coming up with business ideas—which, by the way, we actually do at a disproportionate clip, particularly with Black women—to how do we ensure that those businesses are being funded? That they have access to credit? That supplier-diversity programs in corporate America are supporting those Black businesses?', 'That comes in the form of research, which we’ve been publishing. We’re also convening various groups. We’ve had a number of discussions with corporate leaders as part of our institute outreach around this imperative. And we hope to even begin some capability efforts with Black-owned businesses in the next horizon of the institute.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting, because oftentimes these issues are discussed when there’s a corporate involvement through a bank, for example, or when a financial institution will have an initiative. How does McKinsey approach this problem differently?', 'Shelley Stewart: We try to take a very holistic lens. Certainly the financial-services industry has a huge role to play as we’ve identified access to capital as being one of the largest impediments to scaling and sustaining Black-owned businesses. That being said, there are a number of challenges that are not related to access to credit or access to capital, whether these are industry-selection choices that entrepreneurs are making or access to networks, or social networks that help ensure businesses are successful, or capability-building efforts.', 'And so we’re trying to look across the whole journey of entrepreneurship and not only ask where are there real opportunities for McKinsey but also ask in our unique role as a convener of stakeholders from across the public, private, and social sectors, how do we bring those groups together and point them in the direction of impact? And so I think we can take a bit of a broader look at that entrepreneurship journey, whereas banks play an important but more defined role in certain parts of that journey.', 'Diane Brady: You yourself were an entrepreneur prior to McKinsey. You cofounded Dreadnought Capital Management. What was your experience as an entrepreneur?', 'Shelley Stewart: Ten years ago, a couple of colleagues I had previously worked with at a bank and I started an asset-management firm called Dreadnought Capital. And we had a diverse partner group in founding that company. I think we had a unique set of challenges at the time we were starting it. It was coming out of the Great Recession. I’d like to believe that the diversity of our team made us stronger, so when we walked into a room people said, “OK, wow, this is a group that comes with diverse perspectives, but all have top-notch training.”', 'So I think we did get the benefit of that diversity. Maybe a group of all Black founders may not have been able to have some of the same conversations that our group had, given the makeup of our founders. That certainly was a benefit. But in many ways, that isn’t always the case if you’re a sole proprietor or someone trying to grow your company and you’re a Black businessperson. We’ve got to get people more used to seeing folks walk in the room by themselves that look like me. And while my experience was quite positive, and I had a great group of cofounders, I also had the benefit of having folks who were not Black Americans supporting me on my team [which not everyone does].', 'Diane Brady: You mentioned earlier in the conversation this confluence of the pandemic, which has affected Black Americans disproportionately on multiple levels, and Black Lives Matter. How has that shaped your thinking around the issues?', 'Shelley Stewart: From my perspective, I know that the national dialogue has accelerated. But there are plenty of folks, including some at McKinsey, who have been spending time thinking about this long before this recent pandemic and long before some of the other issues that we’re discussing in society.', 'So in many ways, the content, the problem, and the solution space remain unchanged for me. It’s more about accelerating the efforts because everyone is watching. People are pledging and making commitments to racial justice, providing capital to causes that will help Black Americans.', 'I don’t want to miss that opportunity. So there’s that piece of it, which is about seizing the moment and the broader interest in the topic. The second thing, which I probably should’ve started with, is that the pandemic has made very clear the deadly implications of continued inequality.', 'The disproportionate death rates of Black and Latinx Americans is something that we should all be embarrassed about as a society. And much of these outcomes that we see, whether they are disproportionate outcomes in the healthcare system or  in the education system or even in the criminal justice system, all link to this lingering economic inequality. And so now we see what happens in the most extreme context. And therefore that action—excuse me, that burning platform to act—is really, really timely.', 'Diane Brady: When people talk about race issues, there’s sometimes a sense of a zero-sum game—that you’re helping one group in isolation. But the cost to the overall economy of these issues is something that I’ve started to appreciate. Think about the billions if not trillions of dollars worldwide that are being left on the table by not unleashing the creativity and the economic might of different groups. Can you give me some sense of the broader cost to the economy of not addressing these issues?', 'Shelley Stewart: Absolutely. And I’m so glad that you bring that up because that idea of this zero-sum economy is one of the all-time great falsehoods. This has been studied. People have looked at the gender parity issue and what that’s costing the global economy.', 'And people have also looked at it through the racial and ethnic lens to understand it better. And it’s very clear that there is a dampening effect on the economy when we don’t have broad participation in productive efforts. We did an estimate in 2019 that suggested the US economy is missing out on something in the order of $1.0 trillion to $1.5 trillion a year in annual GDP just due to economic disparity with respect to Black Americans.', 'There are only a few levers that you have to move the economy forward. No matter what your school of economic thought, everyone agrees that fostering human capital and investing in people to unlock productivity is one of the most available levers we have.', 'And I would assert that Black Americans, and I think the data would support this, have been underinvested in for generations. So you have all these individuals who are waiting, with all this latent potential.', 'Black Americans have done amazing things and continue to do amazing things in spite of being underinvested in. If we can shift that narrative and if we can invest more in this group of our fellow citizens in the US and in the UK and in Brazil and all these places, we can unlock productivity and economic benefit that does lift all boats. That rising tide will lift all boats. In the US that number translates to $11,000 to $12,000 of GDP per capita a year if we could unlock that potential.', 'Black Americans have done amazing things and continue to do amazing things in spite of being underinvested in.', 'Diane Brady: Going forward, what do you see as the immediate challenges that we have to address to create the conditions for success?', 'Shelley Stewart: This is something that we will be studying in great detail at our institute, both the outcomes and the determinants of those outcomes, as well as the solutions. But let me hit four primary areas, even though I won’t be able to do justice to all the issues that need to be addressed.', 'The first I’ll mention is community development, which is all about the quality of schools and access to public-health infrastructure and broadband access—the nuts and bolts of what helps communities thrive. We need to invest in these in places where Black Americans live.', 'The second is private-sector development. We talked a little bit about this. Entrepreneurship and business formation in these communities not only creates wealth for the entrepreneurs but also creates jobs for people in that community and has other knock-on effects.', 'Three, human development. This is all about employment and skills training. We have to close this employment gap over a lifetime. We have to close the gaps around pay equity and really ensure that when folks are earning income over a lifetime, that income is the maximum that they can earn and not some artificially low number because they spend too much time out of the workforce or are paid too little for what they’re delivering.', 'And lastly, financial development, which is all about access to financial products and financial services. I  want to dispel a myth that is often suggested, but that the facts don’t support, which is that conducting mass financial-literacy campaigns or teaching Black Americans to save will somehow be the magical unlock [to closing the wealth gap]. It benefits all Americans.', 'Diane Brady: We all need bank accounts.', 'Shelley Stewart: Exactly. There’s no question that all Americans—included me, even though I worked in financial services—could develop and benefit from financial literacy. That being said, fundamentally this is an income issue for Black Americans.', 'Diane Brady: We all wear multiple hats, and as a woman, one of the issues that I think about a lot is the gender lens. Is that something that you look at in terms of the conditions and opportunities for Black women versus Black men?', 'Shelley Stewart: Absolutely. There’s obviously this intersectionality lens, and very core to what we want to accomplish with BEM is ensuring that we are inclusive in our efforts around Black economic mobility, recognizing that Black women often face the double ding, if you will, of being Black and also of being a woman.', 'And the data bear this out. If you look at the progression data in corporate America, you will see the drop off from entry level to executive for Black women is substantially larger than it is for Black men, who also fall of in a very dramatic rate relative to white men.', 'And again, let me dispel a couple of myths. That is certainly not because of capabilities and it is certainly not because Black women are opting out. It links back to a lot of the different things that we’ve been talking about as a society, with respect to racism and bias and lack of sponsorship and support.', 'And so we want to focus on that. Another important area is entrepreneurship. Black women are underfunded and undercapitalized, despite being one of the most entrepreneurial groups just in terms of the data. They start businesses at a higher clip than you would expect, based on their population, and they need to be supported. And we have huge, huge economic implications of not doing so.', 'Diane Brady: What is the advice you give people in terms of actually helping to be part of the solution, as they say?', 'Shelley Stewart: There’s a very tactical list of specific things. But if I had to distill down the essence of all of those tactical things, it’s about being deliberate about the decisions you make and understanding the implications on equity. Whether it is how you recruit, promote, develop, or pay, you need to take that equity lens.', 'It’s important to understand exactly where the dollars are flowing in your company. And it hasn’t worked to say, “Well, we don’t want to focus on race because then we’re injecting some bias.” Saying “we’re not going to focus on it, and it will work itself out through a meritocracy” has not worked. It just hasn’t, right?', 'Because of, again, systematic bias and things like that. So let’s be deliberate about the decisions we make. If you take it outside the four walls of a company and you think about running your business—the products, the services, where you locate your company, the vendors you use—then it’s about taking an equity lens and just understanding how the decisions you make help different groups.', 'And even before you set aspirations or targets, if you can take that more deliberate lens and measure as a baseline, I think it’ll be very surprising to most people who are running organizations to see that many of the decisions that they take—which could make an impact on certain communities—tend not to flow to those groups, not to Black Americans, for example. And again, that just plays out in the data.', 'Diane Brady: The public sector has had initiatives such as supplier diversity, vendor diversity. Is that a model that we can scale to support and grow Black-owned businesses, for example?', 'Shelley Stewart: I think that’s a very important model, both for the public and the private sectors. And you’ve actually seen companies scale. There are a couple of Black-owned companies that I can think of off the top of my head that are billion-dollar-revenue companies now that got their start by leveraging and working through some of these supplier-diversity government programs.', 'Then they scaled beyond that, obviously, and delivered outstanding products and services. So that is a very big opportunity. The one thing that I will say is we need to be expansive in what we mean by supplier. Because it’s not just the supplier of certain services. Janitorial services is an area where we’ve certainly got examples of Black- and Latinx-owned companies, and also we’ve also got some great companies that have done well in food services. Those should continue to be supported by these programs.', 'But we also need to look at the [Black-owned] professional-services side and the investment-management side. There are Black-owned investment banks and law firms and accounting firms and Black asset managers. We need to make sure that they are part of that broad definition of suppliers that fit into and get access to these programs.', 'Diane Brady: Sometimes, we underappreciate the degree to which race is treated differently in the US. You mentioned the UK, for example, or even say places like South Africa. How would these issues be tackled or seen differently in those countries?', 'Shelley Stewart: At the core, you’re right, this is global. And there are certainly going to be unique things in every country. The dynamics around race are different, and some of the challenges are different. And that’s something that we will be researching.', 'But at the core of it, the equity lens is about investing in Black children, quality schools, ensuring equal access or equity of access to capital for entrepreneurship, and being deliberate in our employment practices in terms of recruiting, developing, promoting, and paying.', 'There should also be greater participation in traditional financial products and services. These are things that are going to ring true across the board. And so the question will be not so much about what you do as about how you go and implement these changes in these different regions. And that is something that we hope to develop a very clear perspective on in the coming months.', 'Diane Brady: You’ve done a lot of work in these areas. How does having the institute alter the nature of the research that you do?', 'Shelley Stewart: We’ll continue to do the research, but what the institute allows us to do is to leverage the research foundation to build assets and capabilities that we can help deliver to those who are interested in creating an impact on these issues.', 'And so we really want to take this beyond the research and convening and get very practical with our clients in the private, public, and social sectors, and be able to say, “Here are the areas that are going to make the biggest difference based on our analysis. Here’s the solutions base and some things that we think are going to be high impact. And here’s the empirical evidence for why we believe that.”', 'I really do hope and believe that this institute will allow us to move much more quickly to action and solutions. A former colleague of mine, Jason Wright, was my original partner on this journey.', 'Diane Brady: He’s in the football business now.', 'Shelley Stewart: Exactly.  I think he’d described it as going from admiring the problem to helping us really accelerate toward better outcomes.', 'Diane Brady: I’m aware of the fact that if I’m talking about women’s issues, it’s often to a room full of women. I understand that as a Black American you bring personal experience to these issues, but give me some sense as to how do you engage people who feel like it’s an issue that someone else has? I don’t know if that’s the right way to put it.', 'Shelley Stewart: Understood. It’s a really important question. I fundamentally believe that, given the resource allocations that basically sit at the root of why we’re having this discussion, we will have to engage and activate allies and the broader community if we’re going to address these issues.', 'It goes back, though, to where we started this discussion. If you are not moved by the moral imperative—by the way, I think many people are moved by the moral imperative, the more we bring transparency to the level of disparity—then we hope that you will be moved by the economic imperative.', 'And there are really two sides to that coin. The first is that, as we know, social cohesion is a part of what underpins economic stability. We also know that economic disparity threatens social cohesion. And so we always need to be thinking about that level of disparity in society, not just for Black Americans, but in general.', 'That’s one reason to be thinking about it. And then the other side of that coin is what I mentioned earlier: there’s $1.5 trillion a year of GDP at stake that we’ll all benefit from if we get this right. And so regardless of what moves you to listen and to be curious about this topic, there is a comprehensive set of reasons that I’m confident will push people to action.', 'Diane Brady: It’s about trust and it’s about faith that the government has your back. Where are we on that front?', 'Shelley Stewart: I think there’s a huge opportunity to rebuild and regain the trust of Black Americans. I’ll spare the long history lesson of how that trust was eroded, whether it was what happened with the Freedman’s Bank or what happened with redlining in America with respect to the housing market.', 'There are many, many things that we could point to. But now is an opportunity, particularly for the private sector, to lean into gaining trust in a win–win situation by offering commercially viable products and services that Black Americans need and want—and doing it in a way that does not extract and is not exploitative but that creates a feedback loop of customer loyalty that also helps to build and sustain wealth over time.', 'That will benefit all of us. And there is a lot of work to do in the healthcare sector, in particular, as well as in the financial-services industry. And I think many companies are starting to understand. And the dialogues are shifting. I’ve talked to several banks over the last six months, as well as companies involved in the healthcare space broadly. And there is this recognition of the tremendous amount of work to be done but also of the huge opportunity that exists if we get this right.', 'Diane Brady: Two, maybe three, years from now, what will success look like for you in this realm?', 'Shelley Stewart: It’s a great question. In all honesty, and acknowledging all the humility that is appropriate for this topic, I don’t know how to think about the time increments, whether it’s a year or 18 months or two years. Some people ask, “Can the gap be closed in ten years?”', 'And I don’t have a crystal ball, so I won’t try to be too precise. But what I will say is that if we look back a year or 18 months from now, given the billions and billions and billions of dollars that have been announced and committed to the racial-justice moment that we’re in right now, even though not everything is going to work and not everything is going to be effective, we should have a handful of use cases that have been highly successful by all accounts. We can use those to roll out and scale up and continue to have an impact. That’s my hope and aspiration in this moment.', 'Diane Brady: Great. Well, I hope and aspire to that too. Shelley, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us.', 'Shelley Stewart: Thank you so much.', 'Diane Brady: That was Shelley Stewart, who’s in McKinsey’s Private Equity & Principal Investors Practice and is now a leader of the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility. I’m Diane Brady. Thanks very much for listening. See you next time.']","[[ 1.1777344   0.69628906  1.2158203  ...  0.6225586  -1.8447266

36,Entrepreneurship beyond Silicon Valley,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/entrepreneurship-beyond-silicon-valley,"Innovation is accelerating in Europe and beyond, making way for a new generation of start-ups.","['Innovation is accelerating in Europe and beyond, making way for a new generation of start-ups.', 'In this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with senior partners Kim Baroudy and Massimo Mazza about the state of entrepreneurship in Europe and beyond. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to The McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Necessity is the mother of invention. Whether that was said by Plato or someone else, it certainly has felt true over the past year. From digitization to vaccine development, the speed of innovation has been remarkable.', 'But so, too, has the disruption, suffering, and pace of business failures. In this episode, we talk about the opportunities, challenges, and realities for entrepreneurs around the world right now. What is the state of global entrepreneurship?', 'To answer that question, I’m joined by two people who work with start-ups and entrepreneurs in every part of the planet. Kim Baroudy is a senior partner in Copenhagen who leads McKinsey’s Technology, Media & Telecommunications Practice for Europe. Hi, Kim. Welcome.', 'Kim Baroudy: Hi, thanks for having us.', 'Diane Brady: Massimo Mazza is a senior partner in New York and global leader of Fuel, part of McKinsey’s Technology, Media & Telecommunications Practice. Hi, Massimo.', 'Massimo Mazza: Hi, Diane. Thank you for having us.', 'Diane Brady: Massimo, I’m going to start with you to get the big picture. Is this the best of times? Worst of times? What’s the state of entrepreneurship?', 'Massimo Mazza: I am a positive person, so I believe we are probably at one of the best moments in history for being an entrepreneur and setting up a company. I believe that for a few reasons. On the one hand, there are so many opportunities that we are seeing that have been accelerated in 2020.', 'I believe we are probably at one of the best moments in history for being an entrepreneur and setting up a company.', 'We should always remind ourselves that what happened with COVID-19 was a great tragedy. However, there was some innovation that happened. Think about some facts. We are all comfortable working remotely. Zoom calls jumped up 30 times. In a single year, e-commerce has evolved five to ten years. We have seen 90 percent of the global student population actually have some sort of online exposure. There are opportunities in every geography and in many different sectors.', 'The opportunities are there. We have always said that capital is not an issue, and it’s probably also true now. You have very low interest rates. You have investors that are eager to put money into new ventures. We are continuing to see that. We see more of a jump to quality, but the money is there. The capital is available if you have a good idea and if you have a good company.', 'What also happened in 2020 on the exit side was the phenomenon of SPACs [special-purpose acquisition companies]. This is not new, but it’s something that has gained momentum. That gives, on the one side, more confidence to investors to place their money. It presents another exit alternative to entrepreneurs. So that’s closed a bit of the cycle. Opportunities, capital, and exit options make it a very good situation.', 'On the negative side, we have more need for quality. Investors are looking more on unit economics and looking for a clear path for profitability. They are looking for the best companies out there. It’s something that makes it a bit more complex.', 'Diane Brady: So a higher bar, basically?', 'Massimo Mazza: That’s correct, a higher bar. If you think about ride hailing in China, the top companies are having their best year ever, although the total number of rides is decreasing. That’s because people go to quality. They want to go to the best in class. That means that the difference between who wins and the average will keep increasing.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting. Kim, here in the US, we think a lot about Silicon Valley. What do you see happening with entrepreneurship and start-ups right now in Europe?', 'Kim Baroudy: On the macro level, our track record has probably been less successful. There are many metrics you can look at. If you look at the global or even the US league tables around all the big companies, most of them, or eight out of ten of them, are in some way, shape, or form technology related. If you look at the European counterpart and the league tables here, you would find that that’s basically not the case.', 'Also, if you just look at the top 50 or top 100 companies in Europe, the rotation is almost close to zero. They are getting older and older. That said, we have had a great few years now, where we have seen a lot of exciting cases coming out.', 'If we talk about the macro level, there’s all the usual suspects. There are some ride-hailing companies and also fintechs. We have Adyen. We have Spotify. We have a couple of companies that have now passed the $50 billion to $60 billion valuations. We don’t have the $100 billion-plus, and maybe that’s fine. Valuation is not the only metric to go for, but it’s a good indicator for success.', 'My observation, at least through the European-centric lens, is that we are accelerating and there’s actually lots of exciting innovation coming our way. So I’m pretty optimistic, if you ask on the highest level.', 'You say capital is not a problem. Well, in Europe it actually is—or it was. We’ve seen nice growth rates. I think the estimate for 2020 is $40 billion coming into that, which is a really impressive growth rate. But it’s still $100 billion short of the US, which is $140 billion. And so there are pros and cons here. But we’re seeing exciting momentum and acceleration.', 'Diane Brady: Is it the regulatory environment? Talent? Capital? All of the above? You mentioned Europe seems to be in a bit of a sweet spot, where you’re expecting acceleration. What has changed on that front?', 'Kim Baroudy: So we think about the market structure, looking at the US and Europe, but we should also talk about others. But it’s roughly the same size of economies, right? They’re both worth $20 trillion, give or take, if I include the UK in Europe. They’re roughly the same population. We probably have the same number of software developers and all that good stuff.', 'So they’re not that different, even though we try to make them seem that way. We always focus on the negatives. Yes, it is a fragmented landscape. We have different regulatory environments. We have 24 different languages. We have all the challenges that you would look at; we can spend an hour discussing all the problems. But I actually think if we reverse that, you see we have a lot of diversity. More and more of our entrepreneurs in Europe are taking advantage of that.', 'They are saying, “Well, we actually have a diverse setup, so we have to be able to play in different regimes and environments.” If you look at some of the metrics around it, around 95 percent of all the unicorns coming out of Europe are international by default because they’re forced to be. If you compare that with the US, it’s probably only 60 or 70 percent.', 'So there are strengths we can build on by being fragmented. Of course, there are other things around culture and funding and all that good stuff. But even the market structure, which everybody has always highlighted as a liability or a negative, I think more and more people are seeing that it could also be a strength, at least in some avenues and arenas.', 'Diane Brady: Massimo, do you agree?', 'Massimo Mazza: I do agree. The only additional point I would make is that things can change fast. If you looked at Latin America three or four years ago, it would be exactly what you mentioned now: the top companies being the same, not a lot of movement, fragmented markets.', 'If you look at what it is today, the largest company, in terms of enterprise value, is actually Mercado Libre. It’s not one of the top banks, as it used to be in the past. And it happened very fast. If you look at the level of capital inflows, we actually see in the last two years a more than five-time increase in growth capital than we had in previous years.', 'That was because of the decision of a couple of players. They looked at the region, saw the opportunity, created a fund, and decided to put capital in. So things can change fast. It’s as true in Europe as in Latin America and in other emerging markets.', 'If you look at Latin America, there was no local capital for growth. So you had a lot of seed capital from international companies. What happened is that, all things being equal, a company looked to become profitable sooner. They looked to either go for an IPO or be acquired sooner. They were more conservative. They didn’t grow fast enough. As a consequence, we didn’t have that many unicorns in the region. But things are changing.', 'Diane Brady: For some listeners who aren’t immersed in this world, maybe just explain that getting series A funding is the point at which you really need to accelerate your growth. Is that correct?', 'Massimo Mazza: That’s correct. And I think your definition is probably better than using a quantitative-metric evaluation because that’s country specific. But that’s the moment that you have a good product-market fit and you need to go into hypergrowth.', 'That’s the moment where most of the founders come to us and see how we can partner together. That’s probably the sweet spot. I’ll give you a few examples. One dimension could be go-to-market. How can you dramatically increase your sales capacity, your ability to get to the right client at the right price at the right time in an efficient way?', 'That’s one of the key questions that we get: 90 percent of start-ups at some point have external help for questions around pricing and go-to-market. So that’s one important topic. The second one is international expansion. A start-up normally tends to start being local, knowing a market and maybe knowing a city or knowing a state.', 'COVID-19 was a great tragedy, but there was some innovation that happenedâ€”we are all comfortable working remotely, and in a single year, e-commerce has evolved five to ten years.', 'It’s difficult for them to decide tomorrow, “I want to expand into three different continents and ten different countries.” That’s where we help. We have a presence in 95 percent of the GDP of the world. So if a start-up wants to go into Indonesia, we can help do that quickly.', 'So that’s the moment that they typically come to us. But there are situations where they come to us very early on, preseries A. If there is an exciting opportunity, there are ways we can help. We can cover a bit of a broader spectrum. But postseries A, hypergrowth is the sweet spot.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s distinguish between small business—and small businesses can be fairly large—and entrepreneurship. What’s the difference in your mind? Is it intention? Disruption?', 'Kim Baroudy: Good question. I don’t think they’re that different, to be honest. You can have entrepreneurs inside large companies as well. This is about scaling companies. This is about starting something new and scaling it.', 'That’s basically the philosophy behind this. You can actually do that inside very large institutions. There’s nothing wrong with that, right? What you often see is that it actually happens in very small, real start-ups and in the very large corporates.', 'The SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises] are often kind of a hybrid between them, so you don’t always get these entrepreneurial journeys to the same extent, because they don’t have the funding. They don’t have the talent. There are many shortcomings, but I’m obviously simplifying here to prove a point.', 'In the very large companies, you do see entrepreneurial ventures that are very successful. Of course, that’s true of the whole start-up scene and scale-up scene. But I think sometimes we forget. We did a study, measuring the presence of unicorns as one metric of success. Europe represented 36 percent of all the start-ups in the world, but it represented only 14 percent of the unicorns.', 'Diane Brady: And a unicorn, to remind people, is a $1 billion-plus? Or has that changed? Inflation hasn’t made that $1.2 billion?', 'Kim Baroudy: We’re not that sophisticated. The point here is that we often get these very exciting household names. The US, roughly, gets their fair share. Europe gets half its fair share. And Asia gets two times its fair share. But I think we actually forget the unicorns that are created inside companies. Because they are not household brands, right? These are new ventures, adjacencies, whatever it is that come about. There, what we’re seeing is that we’re probably more on par with Europe.', 'Diane Brady: I want to go back a second, Massimo, to the state of entrepreneurship. Kim raises a point that speaks to this winner-take-all mentality we hear about in tech as start-ups become unicorns. If I was part of a team on the ground trying to start up something, it can be a bit demoralizing. So where are the opportunities that you’re seeing for companies at seed capital to really potentially be the next unicorns?', 'Massimo Mazza: In history, we’ve always had this question: Has everything already been invented? There is nothing more. The large companies dominate the space. Then we come up with new innovation and disruptions.', 'I think we are still at that stage. What changes is how fast you can get to that position and what that means, in terms of competitive distance, versus the others. Both are really accelerating. If you go back to the Industrial Revolution, there were probably a few companies that were 50 times more competitive than the average. Today, with the disruption of AI [artificial intelligence], if you are really the best, you can be one million times better than the average.', 'That has a lot of consequences. So if you are that winner, then catching up to you is very, very difficult. But it doesn’t mean that there are no opportunities. You have to find that opportunity, be the winner, and be one million times better than the average.', 'As to where we see opportunities, there are multiple vectors where I’m really excited. One is around food. Food, end-to-end, from designing and engineering food to healthy foods—more and more people are excited about this. It’s a couple of trillion dollars of opportunities. How do you make sure that you provide the best-quality food in an affordable way everywhere in the world? We see start-ups in developing and emerging markets.', 'Then, on the other side of the spectrum is where and how we consume food. We have seen a boom of food delivery in dark kitchens—online only, with no eat-in restaurant. In the middle, we are seeing disruption in how people get food from supermarkets to their homes. What we will see in the next couple of months is a big shift on the fulfillment space. Microfulfillment centers are booming and will make this chain even smoother, even more productive.', 'Diane Brady: Microfulfillment. That’s interesting.', 'Massimo Mazza: If you think about how most of your groceries that you order online are actually prepared, in most situations you have a person that goes to a store that looks like a normal store or maybe looks like a dark store, if you are sophisticated, but there is a human being that goes there, picks a product, puts it in a bag, and then delivers it.', 'The picking, it’s quite limited. What if you actually use technology and use what in the past was used in large fulfillment centers? You make it very small. You put it in the back of a hypermarket, of a supermarket. Multiply the picking time by 100.', 'Immediately, you make the chain much more efficient because grocery delivery has been very expensive due to the delivery cost and the picking time and the picking cost, especially in developed markets, where the labor cost is expensive. What if you can actually use technology to disrupt that? That’s something that I’m looking very closely at. I’m very excited about this space.', 'Diane Brady: Kim, anything particularly exciting for you?', 'Kim Baroudy: I just want to add one thing because you also asked about the size. This is an evergreen in Europe, that the winner takes all. We don’t like these very large institutions that are too dominant. There’s all kinds of downsides.', 'But there’s also a lot of upside from these, right? We should be transparent around the pros and the cons of these. If I take the FAANGs [Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google], and we can have many opinions about them, the accumulated R&D spend they have in a year is three times bigger than the total of Italy, or the total of the tech R&D of Europe.', 'These large companies, they can buy themselves to momentum. We also see it, by the way, in the pharma industry. I’m not a deep expert there, but you’re seeing more and more of the large pharma companies increasingly relying on external innovation. It’s not all, and it’s not an aspiration in itself, but it comes with a synergy of talent, funding, and infrastructure around these companies. I’m actually pretty excited about many things. There are a lot of verticals where we could get ourselves excited. There are also some other horizontals. Sustainability is one of them. There, we are seeing a lot of exciting innovation and entrepreneurship, both for smaller and bigger companies.', 'But most of the great ideas come out of the start-up and scale-up scene. These are companies that are coming in, partnering with corporates, and obviously driving innovation themselves. But then they’re doing it horizontally and saying, “In a noncompeting world, we will actually help you become more sustainable and ESG [environmental, social, and governance] compliant,” and all the upside around that.', 'I’m very excited about that horizontal. We don’t have Google, we don’t have the FAANGs in Europe, right? But we do have an ecosystem around sustainability. We could argue the same in a few other places, so there are lots of exciting platforms we can double-click on. But I think all of them will probably grow exponentially.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s switch a little to the advice for people who are listening who are entrepreneurial. I came of age, Massimo, in a time when if you were really good you were supposed to go to Silicon Valley. Is that still the case?', 'Massimo Mazza: There are a few dimensions in your question, which are, first, if Silicon Valley represents just the place where innovation happens, where start-ups are developed. The answer today probably is no—that happens in a much more diversified way. We are seeing more and more Silicon Valleys happening in multiple parts of the world. If you are a young talent in emerging markets, your dream was to go to Silicon Valley. We have seen this shift of talent moving from other countries to the US and to Silicon Valley.', 'Today, we are starting to see more and more Silicon Valleys globally. We are seeing São Paulo. We are seeing Tel Aviv. We are seeing Frankfurt, London, Shanghai. There are many Silicon Valleys that are developing, and this is a trend that is here to stay.', 'The second angle of your question is, if you’re really talented, should you go into venture creating something, and building something new? I think that’s still true and probably even more true than in the past. We are seeing the best talent come out of universities.', 'Ten years ago, 15 years ago, when I graduated, the dream was to go into banking. Let’s go into consulting. Let’s go into a B-ranked company. Today, we see more and more people who want to go into companies as a step into building their own company. So there is a trend for the best talent to get into disruption much more than in the past. But we’ve seen them becoming more and more local. And I think that is healthy. It helps you develop economies in multiple companies. It helps you develop a specific solution that you can then export.', 'If you think about some of the most exciting fintechs in the world, they are not from the US, other than having expanded to the US. If you think about the most exciting logistics disruptors, again, they are not there. And that, again, is healthy. It gives different perspectives and allows homegrown talent to stay local and develop their own countries.', 'Diane Brady: Kim, go ahead. You were going to mention something?', 'Kim Baroudy: We were all born and raised looking toward Silicon Valley for innovation and excitement. The facts will also, by the way, confirm that. More than half of the start-ups in the US are in the four superhubs, which are Silicon Valley, New York, Boston, and LA. If you compare that with Europe, the four superhubs are London, Paris, Berlin, and Stockholm. They account for only a quarter of start-ups.', 'There is a consolidation or concentration around the superhubs in the US. There is a trend that is going the other way now. We actually did an exercise where we mapped all the software developers as an example. They used to go for Silicon Valley because of software development, funding, and a few other things. There are actually as many software developers and as high quality in Europe as in the US. But they’re half the price. And, of course, as we get the learning curve, there are a lot of Silicon Valleys around the world by now.', 'Funding is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon. So it is not as concentrated as it used be. Still, the facts will point toward the US being more concentrated around the Silicon Valleys and superhubs.', 'If you can get access to talent at half the price—and, by the way, just access is obviously a huge value for most of these start-ups—I think you will see a more fragmented landscape going forward, and also in the more digital world, where you can talk more. Funding is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon. So it is not as concentrated as it used be. Still, the facts will point toward the US being more concentrated around the Silicon Valleys and superhubs.', 'Diane Brady: Go ahead, Massimo.', 'Massimo Mazza: One consideration on this one is what will be the impact of remote working? If you ask us this question 12 months down the road, 24 months down the road, what will be the answer? What is interesting when talking to a lot of different start-ups of established companies globally is that there is a big and increased fight for talent that is becoming global.', 'Historically, if you wanted to work in a company, you had to move there and stay close to where their offices are. Today, we are seeing competition for talent at the global level. You can stay where you are. You can stay in your country and your city if you like to be there and work for a company on a different continent.', 'So what will be the consequence of this one? It’s still too early to say. But I think we will see changes. We’re already seeing if you are in Colombia and you are a great company in Colombia, there will be an attack on your talent from companies in the US and Europe that can pay much more.', 'You have to find a way to retain them. The other way around, you can immediately find talent in Southeast Asia, India, wherever you want to bring to your company in a way that is very, very different than in the past. So the further we can work remotely in a very effective way will actually make more and more regions, countries, and cities become important for venture and for development going forward.', 'Kim Baroudy: Massimo’s point is only accentuated or accelerated by the new generation that is coming in. They are much more excited about purpose. They’re much more excited about the journey. They don’t come into a local or a corporate identity as we did 20, 30, 40 years ago. The career planning, if they have any, is 12 to 24 months. And then they move on. This is not to say that’s a good or bad thing. It’s just to say that the clock speed of this talent rotation is actually increasing very, very fast.', 'Diane Brady: Because they have options too, obviously. Is the diversification of talent you’re talking about, from the employee point of view, reflected in founders? Because I think many of the founders typically have been two white men. Is that changing at all, Massimo?', 'Massimo Mazza: So let me start with the good news on this one and then get into your question, which is actually quite critical. So the good news is that Compass is just filing for an IPO. Robert [Reffkin] could be the first Black technology entrepreneur to list. There should be more. When I reflect on why this is happening, something that strikes me is that normally an investor relies on a track record.', 'If it’s a large company, a listed company, you can take a look at the financials. You take a look at the analysis. You look at the past ten years of history, and then you make your investment. If you’re an early-stage company, you don’t have that luxury. You don’t have a history.', 'Investors will rely probably on two things: one thing is repeat funders, and the other thing is referrals. But the consequence of this approach is that you perpetuate the practices. And so the fact that, historically, we have more white men funders tends to perpetuate itself. We have to change it.', 'Diane Brady: Because they have the network.', 'Massimo Mazza: Correct. We have to fundamentally find a solution to this one. What we have seen in the last 12 months is the creation of diversity funds. They’re funds that are focused to minorities, a great first step. It would also be great to have more investors who are minorities.', 'That will give a different perspective. They will look at things in a different way. And that’s extremely valuable. The same way that boards perform much better if they are diverse, the same thing happens for investment communities. That’s something that needs to change. We are at the very early stage of this shift, and there is a lot that needs to be done.', 'Diane Brady: Kim, we’ve seen a push certainly toward putting more women on boards in Europe. Are we seeing more women in entrepreneurship there?', 'Kim Baroudy: Yes, we are. But I share Massimo’s frustration here. We actually tried to map this in Europe. It’s obviously difficult. But our estimate is that anywhere between 15 and 25 percent of start-ups today have female [founders]. The challenge we have is that only 5 percent of the funding is from female founders. So there’s a discrepancy there, and for many reasons. It’s a complicated challenge.', 'We are seeing some emerging acceleration and excitement around female entrepreneurs. Like we have at the boards, we’re also seeing around entrepreneurship, that there’s a huge step-up opportunity and it’s being articulated explicitly.', 'You’re even seeing some of the VC [venture capitalist] funds trying to not overallocate but have a fair balance of not just gender but all kinds of diversity in the investment requirements that they’re making. So you don’t get this mismatch between 20 percent, plus or minus 5 percent, are females, but only 5 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, of the funding is from females.', 'Diane Brady: I know a lot of large companies partner with start-ups to fuel their innovation. It’s a great way to scale in many cases, for smaller companies to partner with big. What do you find works well, Massimo? And what are the pitfalls of the large companies that are looking to drive innovation by partnering with some of these entrepreneurs?', 'Massimo Mazza: It’s actually difficult to make it happen. If you look at the pure number of how many corporates want to explore having a CVC [corporate venture capital] or partnering with a start-up, then the answer is most of them. In some geographies it is 80 percent. A lot of them look at this. But if you then look at are they being successful, are they able to do it in an appropriate way, then you have more of a mixed picture. Because it’s not easy to do it. There are a couple of things that you need to ask if the corporate wants to partner with a start-up or if a start-up looks to partner with a corporate.', 'Number one is, the CEO of the corporate needs to be convinced, and this should be a priority. It should be something that is on the top of his or her mind, on top of the mind of the board. If it’s not a priority, it’s just a recipe for failure. Make sure that the person who will be allocated to take care of this venture is one of the top performers at the corporate.', 'At the beginning, this will represent a drop in cash flow, a drop in the revenues of the large company. So if you consider it as a special project, and you put someone young in charge, someone that is not a top talent, then it will not work. The corporate should feel that it is difficult to take out the person that you put as being responsible for this partnership.', 'The second element for me is to make it clear what the mandate is. What are you looking for with these? Because if you are looking for the same risk-return profile of your corporate, then it will not work. These start-ups will need cash at the beginning. They will have a profile that is different.', 'If you’re in it for increasing your revenues in the next two years, it probably is not the right thing. If you want to make sure that you are where the disruption will be, if you want to make sure that you disrupt instead of being disrupted, then it’s the right thing. You have to have a window and horizon that is several years, not several months. The incentive that you give to people that work in this partnership should be different than the one that you give to your traditional executives because what you expect from them is different.', 'The last point is around culture. At times, you see this weird situation where you have the series A, series B groups in the company. If you’re working, it can be both ways, by the way. The one that says, “Ah, if they work in the entrepreneurial area of the company, the one that’s in the CVC or the one that does partnership with the start-ups, then they have all the cool benefits. I can go to work in a T-shirt and bring my dog, or all these stereotypical things. And if I am the other side, I have the meetings, I have the reports. I have 300 emails to write.”', 'Diane Brady: No Ping-Pong table for you!', 'Massimo Mazza: Exactly. So having the right culture, setting it up the right way, it’s very critical. So people, mandate, and culture would be for me the critical point to make it work. But it’s difficult.', 'Diane Brady: We talked about the disruption, largely for business, but a lot of these big companies have also gone remote, they’ve seen a huge amount of disruption. Has that increased the appetite for working with entrepreneurship or having entrepreneurs within your own company? What are you seeing?', 'Kim Baroudy: Absolutely. Obviously our footprint is pretty large. When we think about some of the sectors that were hit hard—it could be retail or sports or whatever it is—they are trying to reinvent themselves very, very quickly.', 'Massimo referred to the major acceleration of e-commerce. You could draw the same parallel in sports. We closed down all the arenas around the world. And e-sports is coming up or gaming more or whatever. We’re actually seeing a lot of pretty innovative and exciting new journeys there. They can never be scaled. Or not never, that’s a big word.', 'Diane Brady: Rarely.', 'Kim Baroudy: Around the culture, to take a classic executive in a big corporate who has been very successful in that world and then say, “Now you need to scale this thing,” and it’s going to burn cash for the next two years, and they’re used to a monthly or quarterly steering.', 'By the way, whenever they start the entry ticket, it is always $100 million, because everything is big in a big corporation. It’s a completely different philosophy. But what you have seen in COVID-19 is a quite impressive acceleration for some of these companies. This is not all internal innovation and entrepreneurship. They actually often have to partner with start-ups and scale-ups to make this happen and become successful. I’ve seen classical brick retailers build e-commerce platforms in less than 12 weeks.', 'That was unheard of two years ago, right? It would take them 12 months because first they need to decide, they need to work with partners. But, really, the sense of urgency has been so high. Now, they’re seeing this work. So they’re saying, “OK, but how can we leverage this momentum and new muscle that we have trained to building new ventures with external parties or not?” So I’m actually pretty optimistic about the acceleration we will see in the next 24 months.', 'Diane Brady: There is this sense of urgency, Massimo. What advice do you have for entrepreneurs who are listening to this right now as to how they can take advantage of this momentum?', 'Massimo Mazza: Clearly, it depends on what stage you’re in. But some advice would be, one, if you’re at the early stage, what Kim mentioned is totally true. Companies 12 months ago were probably scared and they were winding down investment. Now they’re excited.', 'They see that it works and they want to explore new things. So if you sent an email 12 months ago and you didn’t get an answer, send it again. Because now companies are much more open and receptive to disruption and to change. So don’t take one failure, don’t take one event that is negative, as definitive. It’s not. Go back and try again, and try now.', 'The second advice is for later-stage companies. What we’ve seen with most of the companies that we talk to is speed is critical and it’s becoming even more so. So how do you make sure that if you have a great idea, if you have a good product market, you don’t limit yourself to one country?', 'Don’t limit yourself to one area. Think, “How can I do it as fast as I reasonably can?” ‘Reasonably’ means in a way that is not reckless. But make sure that you don’t lose opportunities. Think broad and think big, on how to go global. The last one is always there and it’s around talent.', 'Whether you take fintech, artificial intelligence start-ups, autonomous cars, or blockchain, I actually think that the acceleration of innovation and the scale-up and commercialization of these things is going to be even faster the next two to three years.', 'The fight for talent is here to stay. It’s becoming more and more exacerbated. Whenever you have good people, find a way to retain them. What Kim mentioned is spot-on. You don’t retain them today with compensation. That’s one piece. It should be good enough.', 'You retain them because you are a great leader. They respect your leadership. They respect who you are as a person, who you stand for. Make sure that your company has a clear view of what they represent on top of just what they sell.', 'What young talents want is a sense of belonging. This is especially important now when people work remotely. So imagine that, historically, being at the workplace was your way to create a community. Today you don’t have that. So what will happen in the future?', 'We will probably see microcommunities that form around maybe a satellite location of the company, maybe your neighborhood. But if you are able to take advantage of this need of belonging to retain your talent, it’s critical. Make sure that you capture, retain, and nurture your top talent.', 'Diane Brady: It seems like another entrepreneurial opportunity there. Kim, what advice do you have?', 'Kim Baroudy: The last five years have been a fantastic ride for many of these entrepreneurs. The next five years are going to be even more exciting. Some of them are looking into this and saying, “Now it’s going to slow down. And this whole COVID-19 thing.” I think it’s contrary, right? For whether or not you take fintech, artificial intelligence start-ups, autonomous cars, blockchain, whatever it is, I actually think that the acceleration of innovation but also of the scale-up and commercialization of these things is going to be even faster the next two to three years than it was in the last two to three years.', 'Don’t start preparing for a slowdown. Always prepare for an acceleration. Of course you need the brakes too, you need compliance, and there’s funding—I understand that. But I’ve seen many start-ups in the last six to 12 months, because of COVID-19 or all kinds of things, starting to hit the brakes because they are getting into scenario planning and they’re almost listening too much to the old-school companies.', 'Don’t do that. Accelerate your way. Of course, you need to navigate so you actually stay on the road and capture and commercialize the opportunities. Then it’s all about acceleration. Some of the most exciting companies that we will see will be created and scaled in the next five years.', 'We’re looking into connectivity and automation and artificial intelligence and IoT [Internet of Things] and all of these very exciting functions that will impact almost all the domains and industries. So just embrace them and accelerate. That would be my main advice.', 'Diane Brady: May we live in interesting times. Massimo, any other points you’d like to add just to help those of us who are not entrepreneurs see around the corner? Because you’re on the front lines where we’re not.', 'Massimo Mazza: If I have to pick two of them that will really be disruptive, one is blockchain. And it’s blockchain hitting the main road. So we have seen it already for a while, but now it’s becoming real—the way that it’s disrupting real-estate logistics, how you seal contracts, the way that you store files, the way that you validate events. That will be a big one that we will see in the next couple of years. It’s getting out of the circles of tech geeks into the real space.', 'The other one, if I want to push myself even further, it’s actually metaverse and how the virtual spaces, virtual realities, will finally become a thing that most people will use. We have been talking about these for the last 20 years. But now it’s becoming more real.', 'We see some fashion designers that do their new collections exposed in virtual worlds and not in Milan or in Paris. We are seeing a concert, the largest concert that ever happened, online in a virtual world. It didn’t happen in an arena. So this one is another big disruption. We’ve taken a little bit longer to get on board, but it’s there and it’s happening. So these will be my two longer-term big bets.', 'Diane Brady: Exciting times ahead. And good to have your perspective, both of you. Kim, Massimo, thanks very much for joining us.', 'Massimo Mazza: Thank you.', 'Kim Baroudy: Thanks for having us.', 'Diane Brady: If you’re hungry for more, please check out the new McKinsey on Start-ups podcast from Fuel. Until next time, I’m Diane Brady. Thank you.', 'Kim Baroudy is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Copenhagen office, and Massimo Mazza is a senior partner in the New York office.

Here’s how leaders use today’s technologies to secure supply chains and create value, despite the challenges of deployment.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with partners Michael Chui and Enno de Boer about the fifth generation of wireless technologies and how artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and other advanced technologies are reshaping businesses. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Today we’re talking about the fuel that is powering the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is, of course, the much anticipated 5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology. What it delivers is an astonishing level of connectivity that will transform every industry. Today we’re focusing on the impact it’s already having on manufacturing, from the supply chain to how we run our factories, and, more importantly, that there are many times where we don’t actually need 5G to get this done.', 'Joining me today are two McKinsey leaders who spend a lot of time on the front lines of transformative technologies. Michael Chui is a San Francisco–based partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, where he leads research on the impact of technology on business and society. Enno de Boer is the global head of manufacturing out of New York, where he’s worked with partners like the World Economic Forum on the future of production and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Enno, Michael, welcome.', 'Michael Chui: Thanks, Diane. Great to be here.', 'Enno de Boer: It’s great to be here.', 'Diane Brady: You are both on the front lines. I want to know who has the cooler job here. Enno, what is your answer on that?', 'Enno de Boer: I thought it was Michael, but my job got more and more exciting over the last three, four years—as technology is just exploding on the shop floor. So I would say I’m now head-to-head with Michael.', 'Diane Brady: Well, then we have to start with Michael. Just give us a primer on connectivity, because there really are two things I remember about the Super Bowl last year: one is the halftime show with Shakira and J Lo, and the other is this slew of 5G commercials announcing that the future was here. So is it?', 'Michael Chui: Well, it’s on its way here. You know that the G in 5G stands for generation. This is the fifth generation of these wireless technologies. And each one has been faster—and that’s definitely true. But there are other things, other benefits that this generation of technologies brings. Number one is, it actually reduces latency, which is this slightly technical idea.', 'But it just means that signals go one place and back much more rapidly. And that’s really important when you need to be highly responsive, like for a self-driving car, for instance. It also provides the capability of the Internet of Things, including things on the manufacturing shop floor, which I’m sure we’ll discuss later, and reducing the amount of battery necessary for something that isn’t powered up to stay connected. So it does a whole bunch of different things. The other thing that’s really valuable is it’s much more efficient in terms of how it uses radio spectrum.', 'Diane Brady: Enno, is the fifth generation what’s powering this Fourth Industrial Revolution?', 'Enno de Boer: It is, and it is not yet. But it is soon to come. So to your earlier question, I think 5G is just coming on the shop floor because you need private networks, private 5G networks, and those are just coming up and becoming available. Now, we have a real connectivity challenge on the shop floor because typically to drive value off the shop floor you need to bring together 20 to 30 digital solutions that are really changing the way you run your operations and really augment the operator.', 'I think the challenge that manufacturers are seeing now is, as we see this suite of technologies coming toward us, how to deploy them in a very structured way and make them work together. So that’s the challenge at the moment—it’s all about deployment. The technology is there.', 'Diane Brady: I want to start with COVID-19, because we’ve seen a number of both unanticipated and, to some extent, anticipated fallout from that. Michael, what has it done in terms of connectivity IoT [Internet of Things]?', 'Michael Chui: A couple things. One is that it has brought to the forefront some of the applications that advanced connectivity—5G and other technologies, actually—can enable. So if you think about things like trying to understand whether or not your work\\xadforce is safe, and being able to determine where they are, who has been connected to whom, if you need to do contact tracing, and those sorts of things, these technologies enable those types of applications.', 'It also enables remote healthcare. A number of different things, which could respond to the real public-health and healthcare needs that this unfortunate and terrible pandemic has caused. At the same time, as Enno was saying, we are just in the process of installing all of this 5G infrastructure. It will take billions of dollars and countless person hours to actually put all of the base stations, and antennae, and all the other things that you need to put in place.', 'In fact, it has slowed the deployment of these technologies because it’s harder to operate. These are people who have to work in the physical world, the people who you might describe as essential workers. They are falling sick, they need to maintain social distance, they need to have PPE [personal protective equipment]. And, capital budgets have been strained. The industry association estimates that deployments for 2020 are down about 25 percent as a result of COVID-19. So the need has been increased to a certain extent, or become more obvious. And yet the challenge about deployment has also increased, particularly while we’re still in this pandemic.', 'Diane Brady: Enno, my interpretation, or at least what I’ve gleaned from this pandemic, is that it has accelerated digitization. So I’m trying to bring those two ideas in line—that there’s less money, there’s less being done. But yet, at the same time, we’re clearly seeing acceleration on some fronts.', 'Enno de Boer: So we see on the shop floor, in the supply chain, an absolute acceleration. And the reason for this is that digital is driving real business outcomes. We have seen in this pandemic that we have a lot of uncertainty in the system, uncertainty that needs us to be very closely connected to the customer, because connectivity is important to the customer. And we have seen a lot of supply disruption in the system through this pandemic.', 'Supply-chain resilience is now a must-have. And if you think about supply-chain resilience, what you need is to connect literally all the way to your supplier and really understand where they are in the production process. You need to have a control in place that gives you oversight over your facilities. And that needs a lot of connectivity.', 'We have seen a lot of supply disruption in the system through this pandemic. Supply-chain resilience is now a must-have.', 'So what I have seen in this pandemic is that the front-runners in the Fourth Industrial Revolution have done very, very well because they were prepared and they could retool their systems very quickly and react. Everyone has acknowledged the need for digital technology on the shop floor, so the race has very much accelerated.', 'Diane Brady: It reminds me of that Warren Buffett quote, “When the waves go out, you see who’s been swimming naked.” And that is almost the situation here—those who were prepared have done better. And so, Michael, is it accelerating across the board?', 'Michael Chui: No, it isn’t. And as we often find in this digital realm, it does tend to increase the dispersion, the performance difference between those who are leading and those who are lagging. One of the other reasons why acceleration has been able to occur is, when we studied hundreds of different potential use cases, different ways in which you can use advanced connectivity, about 70 percent to 80 percent of the value could actually be achieved by existing technologies.', 'Now, adding 5G and other technologies which are being rolled out will increase the performance even further. And yet, for those who have already invested in having the infrastructure in place, and are able to put some of these other enabling technologies in place, they’ve been able to accelerate. And clearly the demand’s been there, as Enno mentioned. Whether it’s certain types of retail volume in grocery accelerating because people are staying at home, there are places in the economy where demand has actually increased.', 'But even if your demand hasn’t increased and you do have this uncertainty, you’re going to have to manage your supply chain, you’re going to have to manage your workforce. And so we are starting to see all of these things happen. The more digital a sector gets, the bigger the difference in perfor\\xadmance between the leaders and the laggards.', 'Diane Brady: So it’s like a big day of reckoning in a way. I want to hear more about how this is actually playing out, Enno. Tell me a little bit first about this Global Lighthouse Network—what is it?', 'Enno de Boer: Yes, we started three years ago, with the World Economic Forum, to look at the top 1,000 manufacturers and how they are adopting technology on the shop floor and throughout the entire supply chain. And we have looked for examples of lighthouses that are adopting this with impact at scale.', 'Diane Brady: So that’s like a Michelin star for connectivity? Is it a designation they get for being further along than their peers?', 'Enno de Boer: I would say yes and no. A Michelin star, yes, because these 54 lighthouses—and we just announced the next ten—are really the top front-runners in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In that sense, I would say, a Michelin star. But the ambition of the network is really to make sure that everyone learns from these front-runners and everyone is taken along on this journey. And so we are hoping that everyone is coming at some point to this standard so that this doesn’t stay a Michelin star.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting that, to Michael’s point, not all of this is the latest and greatest technology. Some of it is connecting the stuff we already have. Is that true for the lighthouse?', 'Enno de Boer: It’s very true. Let me just give you a fact. You would be very surprised, but today only 20 percent, 30 percent of all factories around the globe—we have ten million—are really connected with Wi-Fi.', 'Diane Brady: Really? There’s no Wi-Fi in the factory?', 'Enno de Boer: There’s no Wi-Fi in the factory.', 'Diane Brady: I didn’t know that.', 'Enno de Boer: It’s very interesting. Very basic technologies are not there, so this all needs to be put in place. If you are a company that has a factory that still does not have Wi-Fi, you might not need 5G right away. But we’re getting more and more [factories] that are getting there, running 20, 30 use cases that are fundamentally driving value, driving agility, sustainability.', 'We heard from Schneider Electric. They connected their entire energy-consumption sources and reduced their CO₂ emissions by 78 percent through this technology. If you want to do that, you need to have a different kind of technology.', 'Michael Chui: Just to be fair to our manufacturing colleagues, a lot of factories are not very radio-friendly with regard to Wi-Fi. It can be a little bit harder than setting up Wi-Fi in your house, which, by the way, can be challenging as well. But nevertheless, Enno’s point is a great one. There’s a lot more to be done in just very basic connectivity in a lot of factories.', 'Diane Brady: I know you talk a lot about artificial intelligence, Michael, that it may be even further off, that we may use that term a little too loosely at this point.', 'Michael Chui: Well, I think there are lots of reasons why we might use that term a little loosely. I think it [artificial intelligence] implies C-3PO’s going to come in and run your factory. But at the same time, I would point out the following—and we’ve noted this a lot as we’ve thought about artificial intelligence and Internet of Things—these sensors and devices that are connected in a factory, as Enno knows very well, many times people think, “Oh gosh, I have to install all these sensors and install this infrastructure.”', 'I think AI implies that C-3PO’s going to come in and run your factory. But at the same time, you can use artificial intelligence and analytics oftentimes with data which is already being generated.', 'In many cases, these machines are already throwing off data—people have used this term “exhaust data” or “data exhaust.” The machine just throws off this data. You can start to use artificial intelligence and analytics oftentimes with data which is already being generated. And so I wouldn’t necessarily say you have to have everything wired up before you can start using AI. In fact, you can start using AI, which, by the way, is to a certain extent just a bunch of statistics. Don’t think about it as being Star Wars. You can start using that tomorrow, and we see lots of companies that already have started using the data exhaust, which they just happen to have sitting around.', 'Enno de Boer: And the manufacturing sector has more data than any other sector already. So at the moment, the only challenge is that we only take less than 1 percent of the data to make a decision. So I’m there with Michael. There’s a lot that can be done with AI. It’s already creating a lot of value on the shop floor.', 'Diane Brady: What are some of the interesting use cases?', 'Enno de Boer: Number one is the Schneider Electric case, for example, where they had sensors on every energy-consumption [source]. And they would take this in, they would predict the consumption, and with that, optimize the consumption. That would not only reduce their energy consumption, but also their CO₂ footprint. So yes, I have three examples for you.', 'The first one is, it’s all about prediction. So for example, energy consumption. You can predict energy consumption and then optimize this. Schneider Electric talked about how they had con\\xadnected all their energy sources via IoT, and then were predicting and optimizing the consumption that reduced their CO₂ emission by 78 percent. Another good example is to predict failures in machines and, with that, prevent the failures before they happen, keeping the machine uptime higher.', 'Another one is using forecasting to forecast demand. It’s a very common use case where you really try to better understand what demand is coming, and prepare your network so that you can supply that demand.', 'Diane Brady: If I’m sitting in the middle of a pandemic, and I am worried about my expenses, I can see the return on my investment, but I don’t have a lot to invest at the moment. What is the advice that you give to those that want to get some of the gains to this but can’t afford to retrofit their whole factories? Where do people tend to start?', 'Enno de Boer: Yes, so I think we have studied this very well, and we have seen a lot of companies and organizations wasting a lot of resources and money because they are following the pilot purgatory. They are following the approach of letting 1,000 flowers bloom. They are doing a lot of POCs everywhere around their network.', 'Diane Brady: What is a POC?', 'Michael Chui: A POC is a proof of concept. It’s literally where you’re testing out whether the technology works. Now, the problem is that a lot of organizations are doing a lot of these POCs because they’re a little bit in doubt, and they’re trying to figure out what to do. Now, we are saying, “Look, they have been tested. Go to the places, to the lighthouses, for example, that have tested them and gotten the value out of it.”', 'The approach that we have seen working in the lighthouses is, figure out one place—for example, one factory—and concentrate on that. Figure out what is the business problem you want to solve there. Is it about agility? Is it about productivity? Is it about sustainability? Is it about resilience?', 'And then compose the right set of use cases and make a dramatic change, and while you’re doing that, build a scale-up vehicle that allows you to take this across your organization. That is a very wise way to spend the scarce resources that you have on the digital journey.', 'Diane Brady: Michael, I think right now about the concerns people have around hygiene, social distancing. And I would want to have as few people as possible in my plants, which then raises the specter of job loss and automation. How’s that playing out?', 'Michael Chui: The question about automation and its impact on occupations and the future of work is another area of study at the McKinsey Global Institute. We do think, and we have observed over time, that more and more activities that were previously done by people and with human hands are now done by machines. But in history, what we’ve discovered is that we’ve found new activities for people to do. And so one of the questions we try to ask in our research is, “Is that changing?” because we have so many more technologies now.', 'What we actually discovered is there’s still plenty of work that people will need to do going forward that is hard for machines to do. As a result, one thing that we’ve been saying is, the greatest challenge going forward is probably not going to be mass unemploy\\xadment because of automation. The requirement for mass redeployment from what people were doing previously—perhaps doing things with their hands, and then being able to manage a whole bunch of robots, or move into other fields—is a huge challenge that I’ve described as a great, grand challenge for the next few decades.', 'What we actually discovered is there’s still plenty of work that people will need to do going forward that is hard for machines to do.', 'But it’s a very different challenge from the idea that everyone will be out of work because everything will be done by machines. We don’t see that coming in the foreseeable future. Now, by the way, there is another challenge around unemployment that’s related to the COVID-19-related recession. But that’s a different set of challenges. It’s not simply because all these robots are going to take everyone’s jobs.', 'Diane Brady: More of a skill challenge, you mean?', 'Michael Chui: Indeed.', 'Diane Brady: Enno, I want to get this back to 5G. How important is the 5G or the advanced-connectivity portion of this to success?', 'Enno de Boer: Yes, I would say there are two answers to that. Number one is that there’s certain use cases where you really need 5G. So, for example, if you want to run automated guided vehicles, AGVs, over the shop floor, they need to communicate with very low latency, not get in traffic jams, and really get to the line. For that you need the kind of technology that 5G is offering.', 'Another example is if you want to use augmented reality to instruct experts that are bringing their expertise to the line, but then have even more experienced people in the background who, with augmented reality, give them clues on how to do their jobs. That is also something where you need very low latency, you need good bandwidth, and 5G technology is really helping to do this.', 'There are a few of these use cases that can only be done with 5G. But then I think if we’re stepping back, as we’re seeing an explosion of the shop floor use cases, we found 92 high-impact use cases in our research with the World Economic Forum. If you bring them at the same time to the shop floor, you’re running into bandwidth problems. The great thing about 5G is that you can prioritize the traffic like a traffic cop, and with that, you can then manage how the bandwidth is flowing, and you can make sure that literally every application is running properly.', 'Diane Brady: I hear a lot about the speed of disruption. So since we’re now talking about the acceleration—the explosion—it would suggest that the timeline for action is pretty quick. If you’re somebody that has not done this, how quickly will you be left behind in the dust in some industries?', 'Enno de Boer: Let me answer that for manufacturing. So we have these 54 lighthouses, and I would say, compared with their industry peers, they now have an advantage of roughly 18 to 24 months, compared with someone who has not figured out how to leave the pilot purgatory. In technology terms, that is a scary long time.', 'Now, do we see already the effects? Do we see that they take their entire industries, their entire markets? No, we don’t see that. But if we spin this forward, and if we are not getting the masses really going and getting on the same kind of flywheel as these lighthouses are, then we have a real problem. Because I think then a lot of companies and organizations will be left behind, and then in every industry you will see a few that have really figured it out, and they are creating an immense competitive advantage.', 'Diane Brady: So, Michael, there’s a lot of noise out there, whether it’s certain theories about 5G or who’s ahead, who’s behind. How important is it that we resolve the societal discussion around this?', 'Michael Chui: Well, different things are of different importance. At the broadest level, you can talk about the societal importance of this, particularly in advanced economies in the West or Japan, but even China. Because of demographics, the sizes of our workforces are decreasing. And what that means is, in order for us to continue to have economic growth so that we can take people as they retire, et cetera, we actually have to increase productivity.', 'We need to increase the amount that every worker produces for every hour that they work. Because we’re just simply going to have fewer workers. These advanced technologies—these advanced communications technologies, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, the things that Enno is talking about and helps his clients do in the factory—can help accelerate productivity just so that we can make sure our children have better lives than we do. It’s hard to think of something that’s more important than that.', 'And so, getting these technologies in place and putting the management innovations in place that allow us to use those technologies better is incredibly important, you know, for our children, just to be cliché about it. At the same time, this means that people have to change what they do. As the labor force changes, we need to also pay attention and make sure that people actually get paid for the work they do, because some of these technologies could potentially increase inequality.', 'That is something that I think we need to pay attention to. And quite frankly, I think these skill shifts and income changes are the things that we need to pay attention to much more than worrying about how everyone’s going to be out of a job because the robots will take everyone’s jobs. It’s more like, “How do we actually keep people working and make sure that they’re paid, respecting the value that everyone produces for the economy?”', 'It’s one of the reckonings of COVID-19, right? We discover who is it that we actually consider essential workers, and how much do we pay them? I think that’s a really important set of things, and it’s some\\xadthing that this pandemic has really laid bare.', 'Diane Brady: Michael, help us see a little bit around the corner as to what’s next in this area. What’s on your radar?', 'Michael Chui: One is I think we’re going to continue to monitor what the cutting edge of technology is. Things continue to change—on the connectivity side, on the artificial intelligence analytics side, in the machines themselves on the shop floor. So we’re going to continue to monitor that. But perhaps more important is, how quickly can we put these technologies in place and pair them with the management innovations that will actually increase productivity? How can we see competition drive companies forward? Those are some of the things that will really determine how things play out, particularly as we’re trying to recover from this pandemic-related recession.', 'Diane Brady: What about you, Enno? More lighthouses to come?', 'Enno de Boer: Yes, more lighthouses to come. But more important, I think, is that the digital natives have also come into this space. The latest lighthouse that joined our network was from Alibaba, which totally innovated the way apparel manufacturing is done. With customer insights connected all the way to the shop floor, they are able to reduce their delivery times by over 70 percent, their product-development time for new apparel by 75 percent.', 'I think that will show a lot of industries that it’s time to move and will even further accelerate what we have seen over the last couple of months. It’s really accelerating. So that will innovate an entire industry. And I think all industries should be paying attention now. Once a digital native’s coming in, and creating their lighthouses, I think then it’s too late [to catch up]. So now is the time to get seriously moving on the digital journey.', 'Diane Brady: And any final thoughts? I’ll start with you, Michael.', 'Michael Chui: Well, one is, break through the hype on 5G. Really understand what that technology is. It’s not just a way to download things faster. In fact, it has a whole bunch of different characteristics that you need to understand. And particularly, as Enno mentioned, deploying your own 5G network within a factory, I think that’s really important. Secondly is, understand the use cases. Enno mentioned a few of them, which really can create value for your business. And thirdly, how do you scale? How do you actually get from pilot purgatory to impact that your CFO can talk about at the next earnings call? I think that’s one of the biggest challenges for an organization, for a company.', 'Diane Brady: Great. Enno?', 'Enno de Boer: Well, I would just say don’t wait. It’s not too late.', 'Diane Brady: Michael, Enno, thank you for your time.', 'Michael Chui: Thanks for having me.', 'Enno de Boer: Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: That was Michael Chui and Enno de Boer.

Here’s an action plan to reach those ambitious targets.,"['We can limit climate change and reduce carbon emissions to zero if leaders in key industries act now. Here’s an action plan to reach those ambitious targets.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with Kimberly Henderson and Christer Tryggestad about what can be done to truly decarbonize global business at scale. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Along with ushering in a global pandemic, 2020 was another record year for global temperatures. But in Washington, DC, and beyond, there is a renewed sense of urgency to do something about it. I’m joined today by two colleagues who have created a detailed road map for what actions need to happen to limit warming to 1.5°C.', 'Kimberly Henderson is a partner in McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice in Washington, DC, and Christer Tryggestad, a senior partner in Oslo, is a leader of McKinsey’s Oil & Gas and Electric Power & Natural Gas practices. Kimberly and Christer, welcome.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Thank you.', 'Kimberly Henderson: Thanks, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: Kimberly, let’s start by explaining why 1.5°C is so critical.', 'Kimberly Henderson: Sure thing. So Diane, if you think about how climate change will progress, there are obviously a number of events that will become more severe and more frequent. Those include wildfires, hurricanes, severe storms, drought, flooding, and high temperatures.', 'Those events will progress over time, and we would expect to see them becoming more and more severe. And there’s one aspect of limiting climate change that is purely about limiting the severity and the frequency of these extreme events. However, there are also fundamental changes in the Earth’s system that we’re seeing.', 'These are called climate feedbacks. Essentially what’s happening is that climate change is triggering certain changes on planet Earth that then will lead to more climate change. It becomes a vicious cycle. And these feedbacks have increasingly high risk of happening the higher the temperature level is.', 'A 1.5°C change is considered likely to stabilize the climate and limit these feedbacks. But if we see temperature levels much beyond that, it’s likely we would trigger many of these feedbacks. Should I bring to light a little bit for you what kinds of things could happen?', 'Diane Brady: Sure. To some extent, people aren’t clear as to whether we’ve reached a point of no return or what 1.5°C will look like. Is it more of the same?', 'Kimberly Henderson: So there will be some climate change at this point, no matter what we do. We have seen 1.1°C of global warming already. We’re already seeing the implications of that. So at 1.5°C, we could still expect to see more climate change. But it’s a matter of degree.', 'It’s a question of risk level. And again, I think it’s important to understand these feedbacks. Because there are things like losing our forests. If we lose our forests, which would happen at higher-climate-change levels, that will cause more global warming. It will be self-reinforcing.', 'And similarly, losing ice cover warms the Earth. And so the global warming that is leading to the ice loss could then drive further global warming. And that’s what we really want to avoid. We want to be able to stabilize the climate. And at a certain level, we would lose the ability to do that. But now we still have the capacity to stabilize the climate. And 1.5°C gives us the best chance to do that.', 'Diane Brady: Christer, I’m used to talking about these issues through the prism of sustainability and renewable energy. You lead the Oil & Gas Practice. Can you talk a little bit about how the priorities are playing out there?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Yes, I’m very happy to do that, Diane. So the sustainability trend actually hit both the oil and gas and the power industries some time ago. If you look at the drivers of climate change, energy is a very important part of that; 75 percent of emissions are related to energy.', 'For the electric-power industry, we saw the change starting quite a few years ago with incumbent power companies shifting their portfolios away from the more traditional coal and gas burning toward renewables, mainly solar and wind power. And we also saw a series of new entrants moving into the solar- and wind-development space. You could almost say that what we’re now seeing is the next wave of that, which is more focused on storage and hydrogen—clean hydrogen, often green hydrogen—as the new growth avenues for power companies that want to make a business and create value based on the sustainability trend.', 'For the oil and gas industry, the trend is a little bit newer. But it’s happening, especially with many European oil and gas companies now making significant shifts in their portfolios and creating renewable-power generation with quite some force.', 'Diane Brady: What’s motivating that? Is it public pressure?', 'Christer Tryggestad: I think it’s a combination of various things. Public pressure and reputation certainly could be a driver. But I think many of these companies would not do anything unless they also saw a clear business rationale for doing it. So they clearly see good value-creation opportunities related to renewable energy.', 'Diane Brady: Kimberly, talk about the study that you both worked on. What sectors did you look at, and what levers really are critical?', 'Kimberly Henderson: We looked at every sector that generates greenhouse-gas emissions directly. So we looked at the oil and gas industry, cement, steel, mining. We looked at agriculture. We looked at power, of course, all types of transport. We covered the full suite of industries that are significant greenhouse-gas emitters.', 'We worked with our experts in each of these sectors; we work with each of these sectors in our client work to determine what is the pathway for each sector that would be consistent with the 1.5-degree pathway and what needs to happen technically to get there.', 'So what measures can each industry, each company, take to reduce its emissions? When we stepped back and looked across all industries, we found that there were ten things that need to happen that could lead us to a zero-carbon economy.', 'There’s one category that’s around demand: how we power and fuel our lives. That is what people often think of and much of what Christer spoke about. How we power and fuel our lives includes electrifications—electrifying our transport systems and industry and buildings.', 'It includes the renewables adoption where we already see renewables at scale. But we need them at a much greater scale for a 1.5-degree pathway. It includes hydrogen that’s produced in a low-carbon way and bioenergy. That’s all the things that need to happen in powering and fueling our lives differently.', 'There’s an additional category in managing carbon. So we need certain industries to capture carbon at the point where it’s emitted, and then either store it underground or use it in a product. We also need to start managing the carbon balance in the atmosphere. That means taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. The easiest way to do that is reforestation, since plants absorb carbon. If we reforest areas of the Earth, that will help reduce the CO2.', 'Diane Brady: Christer, from a fuel and gas perspective, would you call this aspirational or doable?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Both. We’ve shown by a bottom-up, segment-by-segment analysis that it is actually feasible to get there. At the same time, it’s extremely challenging.', 'Diane Brady: When you look across your sector, Christer, where is the energy being placed?', 'Christer Tryggestad: There are several things. First, many of the oil and gas companies are addressing their own emissions from their core operations. The other thing is that we see a change of portfolio. So companies are moving away from the fuels that have a significant impact on climate change—heavy oils, for example—toward cleaner fuels or cleaner types of energy, like renewable power.', 'Kimberly Henderson: Diane, I want to come back to the point made previously about policy. I think it’s important to understand that private-sector actions will largely be dictated by policy or at least enabled by policy. So policy and regulation are critical to achieving a pathway that’s anything like this.', 'Without policy, a lot of the decisions that need to be made aren’t economical. For companies to reduce their emissions, for instance, there’s a better business case if there’s some sort of a consequence from having those emissions, which in many parts of the world right now there is not.', 'Or if you want to build a new business, for that business to make money, there needs to be a policy or a regulatory framework that allows for that. In many of these technology areas, such as carbon capture, that is a pure cost. So unless there is some sort of regulation or subsidy or incentive or tax, carbon capture will not make sense as a new business model. This is a critical enabler. I want to make clear that it’s inseparable from the private-sector actions.', 'Diane Brady: It reminds me a bit of the ethanol debate people used to have. Let’s look at the different areas. Reforming food and forestry is the first shift you advocate.', 'Kimberly Henderson: I’ll take the two pieces in turn. For forestry, what we find in our analysis is that for this pathway, we would need to stop deforestation. Right now, we deforest an area about the size of Greece globally every year. And we would need to reforest a large area. In our analysis, by 2030, we would need to reforest an area the size of Turkey. So that is a significant change in how we manage our forests and how we support forest growth.', 'Diane Brady: So when you say Turkey relative to Greece, you essentially mean that we have to be planting a lot more than we’re taking out?', 'Kimberly Henderson: Yes. We need to essentially stop deforesting. And the area we’re deforesting every year, we should be thinking about reforesting an area at that scale every year. So it’s a reversal in what we’re doing today.', 'Diane Brady: Where are some of the biggest problem areas with food? We hear a lot about factory farms, for example, but that’s from a consumer perspective. From the business perspective, where are the challenges?', 'Kimberly Henderson: The biggest climate challenge in the food space is methane. It’s not CO2; it’s methane.', 'Diane Brady: Cows.', 'Kimberly Henderson: Yes. Within food and agriculture, cows are the primary source of methane. Rice production also generates methane, and any food waste generates methane. But cows are the biggest part of the problem. If you were to take the global population of cows and assume that they are a country in themselves, then that country would be one of the top three greenhouse-gas-emitting countries in the world. To give you a sense of scale, all the cows on the planet are generating emissions roughly on par with the United States.', 'So this is a major source of greenhouse gases that would need to be reduced. There are some technical measures to help reduce that: certain breeding and genetic selection, methane inhibitors, feed-mix additives. That said, for the reduction in methane that we’d likely need to see, we would expect to probably need a reduction in beef consumption.', 'Cows are the primary source of methane. To give you a sense of scale, all the cows on the planet are generating emissions roughly on par with the United States.', 'Diane Brady: Are we asking people to consume less rice as well?', 'Kimberly Henderson: No. With rice, there probably are changes in production methods that could help reduce methane and help reduce greenhouse gases.', 'Diane Brady: Christer, talk about electrification.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Sure. Electrification. That’s the second major shift that is required to reach the 1.5-degree pathway. And when we talk about electrifying our lives, we basically talk about two end-use segments: road transport and buildings.', 'Road transport today is roughly 15 percent of CO2 emissions. By electrifying that segment—together, of course, with greener electricity through renewables—you can significantly reduce and almost eliminate those emissions.', 'Diane Brady: Electric cars?', 'Christer Tryggestad: That’s electric cars. It’s trucks. It’s buses, three-wheelers, et cetera. All road transport, if you will. The second element is around buildings. Another 5 to 8 percent of the global emissions comes from heating, whether it’s space heating, water heating, et cetera, all related to buildings. By moving from whatever source of energy, for example, gas, toward clean electricity, you can then eliminate those emissions as well.', 'Diane Brady: Kimberly, you talk about adapting industrial operations to make them more efficient. Is that a small fix?', 'Kimberly Henderson: Efficiency is part of it. It’s not only about that. To Christer’s point on electrification, there is huge electrification potential in the industrial sectors now. Things that are currently using fossil fuels could be switched to electricity and switched to clean electricity.', 'So that’s one part of the industrial transition that needs to happen. Efficiency is, of course, a part of it: improving energy efficiency, recycling—steel recycling will be very important to reducing emissions—and process optimization.', 'There’s an efficiency component here that is critical for certain industries. We talked about methane with regard to cows. The other major source of methane is the fossil-fuel value chain: the production of oil and gas and coal. And then the transport, distribution, and storage, particularly of gas that generates methane. Those industries need to take measures to control that methane and reduce those emissions.', 'Diane Brady: I’d like both of you to take us to the front lines, to what people are telling you. Since every part of the economy really needs to decarbonize to get to this pathway, are you finding a lot more interest, especially given the current climate realities we’re facing?', 'Kimberly Henderson: Yes. I think private-sector decision makers largely understand this. Christer mentioned the pressure around climate change is growing. That’s coming from a number a number of places. There’s public pressure. There’s pressure from investors, pressure from regulators, pressure from customers. Increasingly, we see companies asking their supply chain to become zero carbon. If you take an automotive company, for instance, they can have thousands or tens of thousands of suppliers that they are now asking to become zero carbon.', 'In the private sector, it’s now become part of mainstream thinking that we will need to decarbonize. The questions that people are still grappling with are the speed, the scale, and how to make the business cases work. It’s not clear exactly what needs to be done, and when, for everyone, but the realization that this will be an imperative for pretty much every industry is there.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Agreed. I see all my clients now quite focused on sustainability topics. There are two elements. One is about intentionally making the businesses more robust toward future regulation and future consumer demands. The second is pursuing growth opportunities and value-creation opportunities. Of course, the technology cost is going down, as you indicate. That makes it easier for many companies to both take the protective measures and also to pursue interesting value-creation opportunities.', 'Kimberly Henderson: Diane, if you think about cost, there are a few aspects that companies think about. There’s the cost of the measures that they implement themselves, which—for renewables, for instance—is very competitive now. So that’s a viable option for many companies.', 'Then there’s also a profit question. When Christer talks about diversification and what new industries companies want to play in, that’s a different question: Can we make money? Those are two very separate questions that companies are grappling with.', 'Diane Brady: Christer, we are in the middle of a global pandemic with COVID-19. How does that affect the discussions around this or the ability to do it?', 'Christer Tryggestad: It is clear that now a lot of public attention and government measures are focused on handling COVID-19, and rightfully so. For many countries and regions, you would also see that the financial headroom to address the climate challenge will be reduced for years to come.', 'At the same time, I do see COVID-19 as an opportunity to address climate change. First, you could say that the crisis itself has significantly reduced CO2 emissions in the short term. While many of these emissions will come back, our research also shows that there will be a net-negative effect from COVID-19 over the longer term.', 'Secondly, and maybe most importantly, the restart of economies that’s now needed is also a very good opportunity to incentivize many of the green investments that are required to drive and accelerate the transition toward a limit of 1.5°C.', 'Also, for many of these investments, the degree of technology, on average, will have relatively high employment per invested dollar compared to many other investments. Finally, you could also say that if there’s one thing the COVID-19 crisis has shown us, it’s that societies are able and willing to take dramatic measures in the face of a crisis. I would say there’s a little bit of comfort in that as well.', 'I do see COVID-19 as an opportunity to address climate change. First, you could say that the crisis itself has significantly reduced CO2 emissions in the short term. While many of these emissions will come back, our research also shows that there will be a net-negative effect from COVID-19 over the longer term.', 'Kimberly Henderson: I think COVID-19 has also helped to shatter some status quo bias. For a long time, many people just found it hard to imagine what climate change will really mean and what the risk is and how bad it could be for human society because we’ve never seen anything like it before. I think the pandemic has opened people’s eyes to the reality that there could be these exogenous shocks, these exogenous risks that completely change how we need to operate as a society and what we need to do. I think that the pandemic has opened up the aperture of the risks that people are willing to consider and start to prepare for.', 'Diane Brady: When we think about the magnitude of this problem, it almost induces an existential angst—that there’s so little we can do. How optimistic are each of you that we can make real progress here?', 'Kimberly Henderson: I’m actually very optimistic. Technically, we know what to do. This is solvable. You know, some people seem to think that we need to go invent new things and that it will be a genius in a lab that solves this. That’s not needed, actually.', 'We have the technologies we need. We need to scale them. We need to get the cost down. But we are technically able to tackle this problem. What we need is a step change in willpower to get there. For people who feel anxious or worried, I think now is the time to actually feel empowered.', 'This is a moment for leadership. The 2020s are a pivotal decade that will determine the future of the planet and the future of human society. The decisions made now really matter. For people worried about climate change, they should be making different decisions and seeking to influence decisions that are being made in the world—by the public sector and the private sector. Now is the time to really drive this change. It just requires a lot of action in a very short time frame.', 'Diane Brady: Christer, in Europe, the thinking seems to be further along on this.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Yes. So, to your question, am I optimistic? I think it is important to underline that when we talk about a 1.5-degree scenario, the challenge of getting there is tremendous. We’re talking about net-zero emissions by 2050, which is in itself a big task. Even more challenging is the fact that we need to reduce emissions by more than 50 percent over the next ten years. That’s practically tomorrow when you talk about emissions from many of the processes that we’re currently looking at.', 'What still gives me some optimism is the fact that I see a lot of momentum right now. I work a lot in the oil and gas industry. And if you look at how oil companies are talking about this topic, compared with only a year ago, it’s fundamentally different—at least from Europe.', 'I see that trend accelerating. It’s also driven by economics. I think we will continue to see that acceleration. Will that take us to 1.5°C? Maybe not. But at least it takes us a lot closer than the current business-as-usual or reference cases would indicate.', 'Diane Brady: Kimberly and Christer, thank you for joining us.', 'Kimberly Henderson: Thank you, Diane.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Thank you, Diane.', 'Diane Brady: That was Kimberly Henderson and Christer Tryggestad.

A holistic approach to healthcare can help.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with Erica Hutchins Coe and Kana Enomoto, who colead McKinsey’s Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare, about the behavioral-health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and strategies to help leaders and individuals address them. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Many of you listening will be familiar with the struggles that people have faced during this pandemic, from feelings of isolation and anxiety to increased substance-use disorders, grief, and even thoughts of suicide.', 'Today, we’re going to look at COVID-19’s impact on America’s behavioral-health crisis, with lessons that could apply to any country and any individual. Joining me is Erica Hutchins Coe, a partner in McKinsey’s Atlanta office. Erica, welcome.', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: Thanks, Diane. It’s a privilege to be here.', 'Diane Brady:  And Kana Enomoto, a senior expert in the Washington, DC, office. Kana, nice to have you here.', 'Kana Enomoto: Thank you, Diane. Super excited about the conversation today.', 'Diane Brady: Together, these two have founded and lead McKinsey’s Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare. So, Erica, let’s start with the problem. I’ve heard so many different reports, from increased depression rates to working dads embracing flexibility and loving the crisis. What is the actual toll of this pandemic on Americans from where you sit?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: What we’ve seen happen in the pandemic is not only the impact on the physical side, with some of the increased risk and the significant rate of those contracting COVID-19, but also on the mental side. We’ve seen an exacerbation of existing behavioral-health conditions—both mental and substance-use disorders—for individuals who face a disruption in care with some of the challenges underway, and we’ve also seen a new onset of conditions. There’s been a significant spike in reports of depression, anxiety, and substance use.', 'What we’ve seen happen in the pandemic is not only the impact on the physical side but also on the mental side. We’ve seen an exacerbation of existing behavioral-health conditions—both mental and substance-use disorders—for individuals who face a disruption in care, and we’ve also seen a new onset of conditions.', 'This is happening across the board, regardless of socioeconomic status, age, or background composition. It’s creating additional stress for children and adults alike. We’ve been doing some modeling that has shown that we can expect a potential 50 percent increase in the prevalence of these behavioral-health conditions that could lead to $100 billion to $140 billion of additional spend in the US just in the first 12 months post onset.', 'And I think one important thing to remember is that there are much-longer-term effects of the pandemic. These are going to take a toll for years to come. Sometimes the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder does not even appear right away. And this isn’t just from the pandemic; it’s also from the ensuing financial crisis that’s been happening. People have faced job loss or other economic uncertainty, adding additional pressure and stress.', 'Diane Brady: We have seen this in previous crises, haven’t we, Kana? I’m thinking of the last financial crisis in particular. Does that offer any lessons in terms of how this crisis is playing out?', 'Kana Enomoto: Yes, absolutely. If we look back at the 2008–09 crisis, we saw—both in the United States and globally—increases in suicide rates. So, people are concerned that for every 1 percent increase in the unemployment rate we might see a comparable 1 percent increase in suicide rates if there isn’t any intervention or prevention. That is a call to action for us to put programs in place and to reach out to folks and make sure that they have the support they need so that they don’t see suicide as the only option.', 'Diane Brady: I’m interested, Erica, in how surprising any of this would be for you since you’ve been doing research in this area for so long. What has struck you as something that perhaps you weren’t expecting or something that’s especially worrying to you right now?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: As devastating as the increase in the behavioral needs has been, the silver lining is that people are talking about it. I think what has been unprecedented is the step-change difference in the stigma that has been perpetuating mental and substance-use disorders for years, if we look back to the history of our country.', 'And I think about how the dialogue has changed almost overnight because everybody is all of a sudden feeling the onset of distress, the onset of worry, the uncertainty, the grief for those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, and that is making it OK to talk about [these issues].', 'And people are much more open about how they are feeling and how others are feeling, and I think that that has been a big shift that has happened with the pandemic. And I certainly hope that continues because it’ll be a first step toward treating mental and substance-use disorders like any other physical health condition.', 'Kana Enomoto: What has been surprising to me with COVID-19 is really how we’ve seen synergistic epidemics come together. So we know that COVID-19 leads to social isolation. We see the economic crisis leading to psychological distress from job loss, reduced income, and increasing income inequality. And then you see the frontline healthcare workers who are faced with significant trauma and stress, feelings of helplessness, and frustration. And then you have those individuals who have lost people to COVID-19 or have experienced severe health consequences themselves. You have that whole set of stressors.', 'But on top of that, we already had an epidemic of opioid-use disorder and opioid overdoses. We already had an epidemic of increasing suicides. Both of these things have been contributing to decreased life expectancy in the United States for the past 15 years.', 'And then we have the confluence of these three things. And what has surprised me is the exponential impact on the American people, where you see 40 to 46 percent of Americans reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety. That is astounding.', 'Diane Brady: And the opioid and suicide rates have gotten worse, have they not, during this period?', 'Kana Enomoto: It’s too early to tell officially. We know that overdose death rates went up in 2019. And we have some leading indicators that the number is going to be even higher in 2020 due to COVID-19.', 'Diane Brady: We’re living in a time of heightened awareness of social injustice. How does that play into these issues?', 'Kana Enomoto: You know, ever since the summer, where we had the social unrest and the protests related to George Floyd and other incidences of racism and racial violence, we’ve seen a marked uptick in distress experienced by Black and indigenous communities and people of color in the United States.', 'We had 46 percent of Latinx and Black Americans as well as an increased proportion of Asian Americans, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives reporting depression and anxiety. And I think that’s really an indicator overall of the stress experienced by these groups not only from the broader social context but also on the everyday level.', 'And so the impact of COVID-19 and how it intersects with these issues of health equity are really important to attend to. We know that there are also significant rural health disparities. Areas where we face mental-health-professional shortages are much more likely to be rural counties than nonrural counties. When we think of racial disparities, we think of them often as urban challenges. But, in fact, the disparities in access to care for minorities and people of color in rural counties are even more dramatic.', 'Diane Brady: Have you found it easy to cope with the isolation yourself? How has it been going?', 'Kana Enomoto: It has been interesting for me. Within my own family we struggle with mental-health issues. And so we’ve had to make a rapid shift to telebehavioral health, which has been tremendously effective and a good support throughout this time.', 'I have a very close family. They’re scattered across the country. And we made concerted efforts to make sure we connected every Sunday for a family game night. And that’s not even something we would have done before the pandemic. So it’s been a nice way to bring people together and get that boost of social interaction when your regular weekdays are so depleted.', 'Diane Brady: I love that. A family game night. How about you, Erica?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: I would say on one front, similar to Kana in that I also have mental-health challenges within the family. So there was an immediate kind of concern and focus on how do we ensure care isn’t interrupted, and how do we make the pivot to telebehavioral healthcare.', 'Aside from that, there certainly has been a benefit. Coming from [the experience of] being a mother of two very young children who travels for a living, I’ve had the benefit of being home all the time and have, while working significantly, the ability to actually see my family every day. My parents and brother and sister-in-law all live close by. If it hadn’t been for the pandemic, we would not be seeing each other as much as we are now. But we make a concerted effort to spend lots of time together outdoors.', 'When I think about how the pandemic has impacted me personally, it’s been such a personal call to action. We set up the Center last year before the pandemic hit. Knowing that we are in a position to be able to make a difference on this topic—raising awareness around the urgency to address mental and substance-use disorders as Kana just described—is a strong sense of calling that makes it much easier to get through the days. Even if we’re not able to be with our colleagues physically, it makes everything seem worth it.', 'Diane Brady: Erica, I’m curious. What inspired you to get into this field in the first place?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: I think what inspired me to want to dedicate my career to making a difference in improving our broader behavioral-healthcare system is a very personal experience. When I was in college, my younger brother first started to develop symptoms of a thought disorder.', 'I think seeing what his experience was—dealing with a mental illness now for the majority of his adult life, seeing the challenges firsthand of actually finding access to high-quality care, some of the challenges of stigma that exist, some of the uncertainties—really fueled me to say, “If we all experience things for a reason in our life, what am I going to actually do about this?”', 'The fact is that this can truly happen to anyone. This is rooted in a biological disorder, in genetics. It very easily could have been me that was born with a precondition to develop a thought disorder later in life versus my brother. So if I’m actually in this advantaged position, working for a large, reputable firm like McKinsey, how do I use that to drive good?', 'The opportunity came up to get energy around the Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare and to raise more awareness about these issues and truly make a difference in the health system on a large but also on a very individual level. Anything I can do to help my brother—and every other individual who might be facing something similar and might not have the confidence to talk about it because of the stigma that exists—is what really drives me to do this day in and day out.', 'And honestly, that’s what so inspired me about Kana when I met her. If I was ever to fulfill my mission of bringing together my personal passion for driving change in behavioral health with my professional role of being a partner with McKinsey, I knew I needed somebody like Kana at my side to help me make this difference. And it’s been a wonderful experience and partnership so far.', 'Diane Brady: So, Kana, tell me about your own experience of getting into this field. You were with the Surgeon General’s Office.', 'Kana Enomoto: I joined the federal government over 20 years ago and dedicated my career to addressing mental-health and substance-use issues at a macro level because, as a child, members of my family struggled with mental illness, with psychosis, with depression, with trauma.', 'When I was 13 years old, I lost a family member to suicide, which made a marked impact on me because no one ever talked about it. People said she died of a heart attack. She was in her early 20s. She didn’t die of a heart attack.', 'So I wanted to understand how is it possible that somebody so beautiful, so smart, and so wonderful could not see a path to health, and that the people around her couldn’t get her healthy. In college, I majored in psychology. I did clinical psychology. I worked for the government because I didn’t want to just make a difference at an individual level; I wanted to help create a system where that could never happen again.', 'And then more recently, in my own family, my daughter has had a number of mental-health challenges. It was almost impossible to get good-quality care. I really had to struggle and fight and call friends and do a lot of investigative work myself and spend the night in the emergency room.', 'It just shouldn’t have been as hard as it was to get care for somebody. I have all the resources in the world. I can’t imagine how difficult it is for people who know less, know fewer people, and don’t have as good insurance as I do. So I’m super passionate because I know these issues are preventable and they’re treatable, and it’s just a matter of having the political and social will to get it done. We can do it.', 'Diane Brady: And it’s about having a holistic approach, right? Erica, that’s really what your work is all about: connecting the dots in some ways and creating that ecosystem where change can happen.', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: Yeah, that’s exactly right, Diane. First, helping everyone to realize that this can happen to everyone. This isn’t someone else’s problem. It’s an issue we all should pay attention to and want to solve together for each other. That approach—to try to improve someone’s health and overall well-being—needs to take behavioral health into account.', 'We know that one in two individuals, in the course of his or her life, will have some type of mental or substance-use disorder, challenge, or experience. In order to improve the health of our country, to reverse the decline in life expectancy that has been happening, we need to account for the whole person.', 'One in two individuals, in the course of his or her life, will have some type of mental or substance-use disorder, challenge, or experience. In order to improve the health of our country, to reverse the decline in life expectancy that has been happening, we need to really account for the whole person.', 'Diane Brady: I’m curious about the Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare. How did that come about?', 'Kana Enomoto: Actually, the Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare is what drew me to McKinsey in the first place. I got a call from Erica. I had met her through other work when I was with the Surgeon General’s Office. And she said, “We’re thinking of starting this center. We’re going to look at mental health. We’re going to look at social determinants. And we think it could be a really exciting way to put McKinsey’s tools and resources to good use. Do you know folks who would be good for this?” And I said, “That sounds so exciting and like something I would love to dedicate my time and energy to.”', 'So, in pretty short order, Erica worked her magic, and I was able to join the firm. It’s been an outstanding ride since then, where we’ve been able to do work that is super meaningful and high impact for the field and for the country.', 'Diane Brady: So, Erica, tell me about the vision. What gap in the marketplace were you seeing that this was meant to address?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: As a healthcare practice, we had been doing work across the focus areas of our center for a number of years: client work on mental and substance-use disorders, social determinants of health, rural health, and maternal health. But we really felt that these issues weren’t just impacting the healthcare system, they were impacting the broader society at large. If we were only doing the work one client at a time, we would never make the difference that needed to happen. We knew that the real solution there would be in collaboration.', 'And how do we really collaborate with other partners and stakeholders to be able to spur the innovation that was needed to make a step-change difference across these issues? Take the topic of behavioral health across mental and substance-use disorders in particular, which is such a cross-cutting topic. That’s going to be driving issues in rural health, driving issues in maternal health, driving issues in some of the unmet social needs. These are issues that matter to our global society. We, as McKinsey, have capabilities to help. So let’s do something totally different. The whole goal is to be able to enable others to replicate things that have been proven effective to try to scale change.', 'Diane Brady: When you say “partner,” are you partnering with health systems? Are you partnering with employers?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: We are still in early days of the Center, but I think the goal would be partnering with anybody. It can be partnering with a foundation that maybe is also trying to move the needle and do important work in certain spaces. It could be partnering with a health system that wants to pilot a specific care-delivery innovation on a population that could better integrate behavioral health into a primary-care setting. It could be partnering with a payer that is really aiming to change value-based payment around behavioral-health conditions. It could be partnering with a community-based nonprofit, with an academic institution, or with employers—given the significant role that employers play in terms of access to benefits for their employees.', 'So I think that we’re quite open. One of our big partnerships to date has been with Shatterproof, a national nonprofit focused on reversing the negative impact that addiction has across the country by really focusing on how to reduce the stigma that exists.', 'Diane Brady: I’m originally from Canada, and I’ve always been intrigued by the US. What is unique about this market with regard to behavioral health?', 'Kana Enomoto: I think the United States is uniquely positioned in the field of behavioral health. On the one hand, we lead on so many dimensions. Our science is incomparable. In terms of what we’re doing around peer services, community-based services, trauma-informed care, and culturally competent care, the United States really leads the world.', 'On the other hand, there are some challenges based on how our healthcare system is structured. It’s more of a disease-care system than a health-promoting system. People have access to services through their employer-based insurance.', 'Where other countries are investing quite a bit in social care—making sure that people have adequate housing, people have employment, people have good transportation and food security—in the United States, those challenges compound people’s experiences of mental illness and substance-use disorder. It makes it that much more challenging for them to achieve recovery.', 'So I think it is a mixed bag where other countries do better on the prevention, promotion, social-care aspects and helping people achieve and maintain recovery. On the other hand, we really lead in terms of advancing evidence-based models of care and innovation.', 'Diane Brady: Erica, you mentioned employers. I know there have been a lot of investments in wellness programs and such at the private-sector level. But we’re facing some really significant economic constraints and a very different work environment with remote working. What are you hearing from employers?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: We’re hearing loud and clear that employers are concerned about the impact that the pandemic is having. We did a recent survey that showed nine out of ten employers felt that COVID-19 has been affecting their workforce’s behavioral health and productivity. They’re seeing increased rates of self-reported depression, anxiety, and alcohol and drug use.', 'One of the big challenges of this large-scale shift to remote work is that you don’t see each other personally on a day-to-day basis. It becomes that much harder to really be able to detect if somebody needs help and if they’re facing a challenge, or to just check in.', 'In addition to employees themselves feeling increased distress, parents who are working full time and have children in a remote-schooling situation have the added challenge of concerns about their children’s mental health.', 'That is another draw on productivity. So employers are also trying to take a more holistic approach and asking, “How can we help our employees in terms of their total life?” We’re hearing employers show and express interest but often not knowing what tools to use.', 'So how do employers know where they currently stand in terms of their offerings? Are they at parity with what they’re offering for behavioral-health care versus physical-health care? What are things they can be doing to increase the dialogue and reduce stigma around issues, especially in a remote environment?', 'We’re hearing loud and clear that employers are concerned about the impact that the pandemic is having. We did a recent survey that showed nine out of ten employers felt that COVID-19 has been affecting their workforce’s health and productivity.', 'Diane Brady: It’s very easy to have the whole conversation revolve around mental health and substance abuse, but there are other areas of focus that you take, Kana, in the Center. Can you tell us a little bit more about that and the impact COVID-19 is having, say, on the societal determinants of behavioral health?', 'Kana Enomoto: People who have challenges on various dimensions of social determinants are going to be at higher risk for COVID-19. For example, those who have to take public transportation are at increased risk, as are people who have insecure housing, who are homeless, who are living in overcrowded conditions. These are tremendous risk factors that we are seeing result in higher rates of positivity and health risk. And then if you combine that with the already-existing challenges of poverty, economic deprivation, or income inequality, that compounds those inequities.', 'Then you have the challenges of kids going to schools and the education loss. Kids from lower-income families are going to suffer more educational loss than kids who go to excellent-quality schools. As they have moved to distance learning, you hear of some schools that have high rates of free and reduced lunch also having very high rates of kids not signing into the virtual-learning environment. We are going to have years to deal with the impact of COVID-19 on the social dimensions that we were just talking about.', 'Diane Brady: What are some of the things that can spark change? Let’s start with healthcare leaders. What could they be doing right now to avert or at least mitigate some of the worst impacts of COVID-19?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: We’ve known for decades that there are high rates of co-occurring disorders between behavioral-health and physical-health conditions. So what’s really going to spark change now? I think it comes down to two things. One is knowing that there’s a solution, knowing that substance-use disorders and mental-health disorders are treatable, addressable conditions, and people can recover from them or they can be prevented.', 'A second part of that is the business case. This isn’t just the right thing to do to help people, but there’s value there. Then, I think the third piece is the social-norm aspect of it. The more that dialogue continues about the awareness that behavioral-health conditions can happen to anybody—they’re not something that is a moral failing because of how you were raised; they really, truly cut across class, economic background, age, et cetera—the more there is an obligation to say it’s time to do something about this.', 'In our work with Shatterproof, we did a whole set of research on analogous change movements. What is it that changed behavior when there was a deeply rooted stigma and lack of treatment and change? Take the example of HIV/AIDS. One of the biggest pieces that drove action was when all of a sudden focus was on Ryan White, Magic Johnson, or others where a light bulb went off—“oh, this could really happen to anybody.” That starts to make a difference.', 'Diane Brady: It does. And certainly you’re seeing a lot of people talk about mental health. When we look at other countries and the approach that they take, how is it different from the US?', 'Kana Enomoto: In developed Western countries, we see that emphasis on social care and prevention and on embracing behavioral health. In some low- or middle-income countries you see the exact opposite, where there really is no behavioral-health or mental-health system to speak of, where there is very low health literacy around mental illnesses and substance-use disorders, and you lack much of an infrastructure to address these issues.', 'One of the great researchers in this area, Vikram Patel, says there’s virtually less than 1 percent penetration of psychological therapies in some low- and middle-income countries. It’s impossible to get care because it’s just not something that’s talked about. One anecdote that I heard is that in all the 22 [scheduled] languages spoken in India there isn’t a word for “mental health.” So it just shows that we have a ways to go.', 'There are interventions that are innovative and that have worked in lower-resourced economies. There is a greater reliance on social supports and social networks that can be very supportive, healing, and curative, helping people achieve and attain recovery. But there are also some surmountable factors in terms of getting people access to evidence-based therapies as well as the modern-generation psychiatric medications. So lots of challenges and lots of opportunities.', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: I think one big difference is that often other countries are making a much more deliberate investment in social care and social needs—the broader social services that surround someone—which directly plays into that concept of whole health.', 'So it isn’t just about your physical health and your behavioral health, it’s about how are your broader social needs met? Do you have a roof over your head at night? Do you have access to healthy food? Do you have social support? Are you isolated?', 'There often is a higher amount of investment into the surrounding social services than here [in the US], which is some of what exacerbates the challenges that then fall on our existing behavioral-health care system because it is more separated from the broader social supports that an individual needs to truly thrive.', 'Diane Brady: As an employer or healthcare leader, what are some of the tactics right now that you could be doing to perhaps encourage people to address some of these issues?', 'Kana Enomoto: That’s a great question, Diane. I think there are a few things that we’re recommending that employers can do to help their workforce address the stress and the mental-health and substance-use consequences of COVID-19. First of all, let’s take a deep look at the benefits that they’re offering to make sure that they have sufficient healthcare benefits, that they have access within their EAPs [employee-assistance programs] to tools and programs that can help people manage their stress and access help should they need it.', 'Then the employer needs to make sure they’re communicating what those resources are to their workforce and sending the message that this is the expectation, that it’s OK to not be OK, and that we see this as a fundamental part of your overall health. Because we value you as an employee, as a workforce, as a person, we want you to be healthy. And part of that means that you are mentally healthy, that you’re addiction free, and that you have access to the treatment services and supports that you need.', 'And then it’s creating a culture within the work environment where it’s OK to talk about these things, where people who are in treatment are respected and cared for, and where people who are in recovery are also celebrated and supported for having overcome a health condition just like any other.', 'If you or somebody you know is struggling with one of these issues—depression, anxiety, problems with drinking too much or turning to prescription drugs—it’s important that people take the brave step to ask for help, whether that’s from a friend, from a clergy member, from a primary-care doctor, or from a mental-health or substance-use specialist. Asking for help is not easy to do, but it can be life changing.', 'If you’re a person who isn’t struggling but has the resources to help others, reach out and take the brave step to offer help to someone who you might see struggling. That can be so important and pivotal in a relationship where it’s hard to break past exchanges such as, “How are you doing? I’m doing fine.”', 'For people who are part of an organization where they have influence—whether that’s as a CEO or as a frontline employee—look around and ask the question of whether or not we are supporting these issues. Are we supporting people who struggle with these issues? Demand that we treat mental illnesses and substance-use disorders with the same care, urgency, skill, and knowledge that we do any other condition. If we all do that, it can really make a difference.', 'Reach out and take the brave step to offer help to someone who you might see struggling. That can be so important and pivotal in a relationship where it’s hard to break past exchanges such as, ‘How are you doing? I’m doing fine.’', 'Diane Brady: Kana, I’m curious about the role that policy plays in this area.', 'Kana Enomoto: That’s a great question because in the last 12 or so years, we’ve seen incredible momentum come from the policy side—where you have mental-health parity and addiction equity, where payers are no longer allowed to discriminate and put unfair limitations on treatment for mental and substance-use disorders in ways that they don’t put limitations on treatment for physical-health conditions.', 'For example, people used to be limited to, say, 12 outpatient therapy sessions a year. Well, if you have a condition like schizophrenia, there’s just no way to manage that. So it was an unfair burden on families and individuals to try to manage mental-health and substance-use challenges.', 'For many people, substance-use care was not covered at all. In the last dozen or so years, together with the Affordable Care Act, you’ve seen tremendous progress in this space because of those policies. And then more recently, in the SUPPORT Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, we’ve seen more and more momentum growing on the federal side as well as in states, which are moving quickly to make sure these issues are getting addressed.', 'Diane Brady: Erica, in terms of the return on investment—as a society, as individuals, as employers—what thoughts would you want to leave with people to make this top of mind?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: The return on investment is the fact that you have increased productivity and retention. If you’ve hired somebody and invested significantly in them and then they leave because of some type of challenge with a mental-health or substance-use disorder and the right supports weren’t there to keep them there, you have to hire somebody brand new. That’s lost investment.', 'From a healthcare-system side, there’s been ample research that shows that those with behavioral-health conditions that are unmanaged are driving a spike in physical-health costs. The incremental dollars it will take to provide more therapy or the right medication are nothing compared to the savings on the physical-health side.', 'Imagine somebody who is suffering from depression who also has diabetes. Well, if their depression isn’t well managed, they are unlikely to be checking their blood-glucose levels on a regular basis, unlikely to be taking medicine, to be checking in with their physician, to be keeping to the right diet and exercise.', 'This isn’t an insurmountable problem. We actually know what works. There are evidence-based interventions that exist. They just aren’t scaled.', 'Take, for example, first-episode psychosis. Only about 5 percent of adolescents who experience psychosis for the first time actually get the evidence-based care that we know works today. And there’s significant access issues, too. So it’s not that we don’t know what works. We just need to apply it, which in a sense is a much better position to be in than if we had no idea where to even begin.', 'Diane Brady: You talked about silver linings. I imagine that some of what we’re learning about remote work, for example, could be applied to areas like rural health, which I know is another area of focus for you.', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: Certainly. I think that there has been tremendous benefit from some of the flexibilities that have been introduced in telebehavioral health. Once a number of providers got up and running and were able to be tele-enabled, there has been a significant benefit in addressing some of the access challenges that existed. It’s something that we certainly hope will persist beyond the pandemic as a benefit and an opportunity that has come out of the situation.', 'Diane Brady: The game night, Kana, sounds intriguing to me [as an example of staying socially and mentally healthy during the pandemic]. What would you say to the individual listener right now that could make a real difference? Any advice?', 'Kana Enomoto: I think there are basic precautions that people need to take to make sure they’re eating, they’re sleeping, they’re exercising adequately. And that can be hard when there’s a blurring of lines between your workday and every other day—or every other time and every other space in your life. It all blends together, and so it can be hard to take the time out to do that self-care.', 'I think it’s also important to monitor yourself and ask, “How is my mood doing? Am I drinking more alcohol than normally, or am I using illicit substances in a way that is worrisome to me or to others?” And then to make sure that you’re willing to ask for help and you know where to get that help because we want to address these issues before things get too far away from us.', 'Diane Brady: Erica, any advice for individuals or even individual leaders?', 'Erica Hutchins Coe: Never underestimate the impact that human connection can have. You need to deliberately build it into your day. You’re not going to be passing someone in the hall. You might not be seeing extended family members as often.', 'Ask someone how they’re doing. To Kana’s point earlier, go beyond the cursory “How are you? I’m fine, thanks,” and move on to the next thing. And try to stay a little bit even more in tune [than usual], really keeping that radar up to anything that seems off, and ask the next question.', 'I think it makes a significant difference to individuals who are suffering to know that somebody is reaching out and that it’s okay to talk about it. So I think that’s something that we can all apply in our personal and professional lives—keeping an eye out for our colleagues just as we would with our family members or close friends and taking that extra effort to ask somebody how they are really doing today.', 'Diane Brady: Great.

Planning is key.","['How can senior managers get better, faster business decisions from the meetings they attend or lead? Planning is key.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey’s Aaron De Smet and Leigh Weiss about planning more effective decision meetings. An edited version of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady in New York. How would you rate yourself in making decisions? Most of us, it turns out, are not great deciders, and the more choices we have, the tougher it gets. McKinsey research shows that executives on average spend almost 40 percent of their time—that’s 40 percent—making decisions and believe most of that time is poorly used. In this episode, Simon London looks at the power of decision meetings and how to make them better. Joining him, Aaron De Smet, a McKinsey senior partner based in New Jersey, and Leigh Weiss, a senior expert based in Boston. Here’s Simon.', 'Simon London: Leigh and Aaron, welcome back to the podcast. And thanks for being here.', 'Leigh Weiss: Thank you. Good to be here.', 'Aaron De Smet: Great to be here.', 'Simon London: The last time you were here, we talked about different types of decisions that get made in organizations and certain best practices around them. Today we’re going to be talking about decision meetings in particular and how to make decision meetings go better. Leigh, why don’t you start us off? Why is this such a pain point?', 'Leigh Weiss: One of the things that we found in our research is that executives on average spend almost 40 percent of their time making decisions. Much of that happens in meetings. And 60 percent say that the time spent making decisions is poorly used. It’s not very effective. And that’s a dramatic statistic when you think about the amount of time we spend at work.', 'Simon London: So with the sheer number of hours that are spent in decision meetings, based on what we can tell, people are just not satisfied with the quality of the output?', 'Aaron De Smet: Exactly. The more senior they become, the more time executives spend making decisions. And it’s mostly in meetings. So they’re spending, as they get into the senior ranks, more than half of their time in meetings trying to make decisions. And they are saying most of that time is wasted.', 'Simon London: OK, so let’s assume I am one of these fairly senior executives. I spend a lot of my time in meetings, a lot of my time on decision making, and I am dissatisfied with the productivity and the quality of that time. Where do I begin?', 'Leigh Weiss: Well, first, I would say there are four common failure modes from meetings that we’ve observed. One is that you don’t make a decision. A second is that you make a poor decision. A third is that you make a slow decision. And a fourth is that you make a low-commitment decision. And these are all common challenges that we need to address.', 'Simon London: And a low-commitment decision is where everybody agrees in principle, but nothing happens?', 'Leigh Weiss: That’s right. We all shake our heads and nod yes in the room. And then we leave. And there are backdoor discussions and hallway conversations where we decide, “Actually, that’s not what we’re going to do.”', 'Aaron De Smet: My role at meetings is just to observe them. And one of my aha moments was that most meetings are designed to not make a decision. They’re almost set up that way structurally. You end up with a bunch of people in a room—talking about important topics. The job of presenting something has been delegated to an individual or a team. And they come in. And they present. And they haven’t actually made explicit who decides.', 'So you have a room full of people who are very important, who are very influential, and who are critical stakeholders. And there’s some assumption that either the one senior-most leader in the room decides or that everybody gets a vote. And sometimes the senior-most leaders just don’t make a call, which can be bad, because they don’t have all the information.', 'And so they invite people and ask, “Well, what do you think? What does everybody think?” And now everybody seems to have a vote. And the problem with everyone having a vote is that everyone has a veto.', 'So they present the one option that they really want. And they try not to have any dissenting opinions, because, otherwise, one person with a veto just slows it down. And this is where you end up with a low-quality decision.', 'Simon London: So just to bring it back to the very practical: Again, if I’m one of these dissatisfied executives, where do I begin? Do I look at my calendar and think about the meetings and try to look for these ones that you’ve identified just now as they’re obviously not set up in a way that’s going to be productive?', 'Leigh Weiss: One of the things that you can do is decide whether you actually need a meeting to make the decision. And often a decision can be delegated to an individual role, a particular person. So there was a healthcare company where the executive committee was being overrun by decisions. And they took a look at the decisions they had to make and cut out 30 percent of them by delegating them to individual roles. Those were decisions like, “What are the benefits that we are going to provide?” That was delegated to the head of HR.', 'And when you delegate a decision, it doesn’t mean that the person can’t consult others. It just means that you don’t need a group of people to come together to make the decision.', 'When you delegate a decision, it doesn’t mean that the person can’t consult others. It just means you don’t need a group of people to come together to make the decision.', 'Aaron De Smet: I would advise an executive not to start with the meetings—other than cutting them out if possible—but start with the decisions. So one of the problems that you often see is that we start with meetings and topics and who should be informed and aware and involved.', 'But if you start with a meeting around a topic and who should be involved, you get what most meetings end up being—a general discussion of people presenting things to each other. And that’s part of the problem. And it’s fine to have that meeting. But then be clear: The purpose of this meeting is not to make a decision. It’s for us to present things to each other.', 'Once you know what decision you want to make, then you can start orchestrating the meeting around the decision. This is one of the first questions: Can this be delegated to an individual? And if so, does the individual want to present something to the team? Because they don’t need it for a decision now. Now the individual can just go make the decision. And you tell them, “If you need help and you want to consult people, go for it.”', 'If you really need a group of people to make a decision, you start with who are the decision makers? And if you say, “OK, Leigh and Simon, you are the two decision makers,” then I would say, “OK, Leigh and Simon, who do you want in the room with you when you make the decision?”', 'And if you say, “Ah, I think for this decision—this type of decision or this recurring decision—these are the people who should be in the room,” then we set up the meeting that way. We say, “OK, by the way, it’s still Leigh and Simon who get a vote. No one else has a vote. But they want you here to help them.”', 'Simon London: So I’m hearing two things. Number one, I should start with the decisions that need to be made, not my calendar. But on the other hand, presumably there’s a point at which you need to look at your calendar. And you need to ask yourself, particularly about the recurring meetings, “What is it for actually? What is the scope of that meeting?” And to your point about a big executive committee meeting, what’s the scope? Has it drifted to a point where it’s not clear what the scope is and has everybody forgotten why we first gathered in the first place?', 'Leigh Weiss: What’s the scope? And do I need to be there? Am I going to the meeting because I want to find out what’s going on—which could happen much more easily and efficiently if there’s a memo or communication sent out afterward—or am I going to the meeting because I have an important say in what’s happening? It gets to the point of, first, not reflexively accepting all meeting invitations that come your way. And then, second, being clear about what your role is in the meeting. Are you there to contribute a perspective that will inform a healthy debate and lead to a high-quality decision? Or are you there to spectate?', 'Aaron De Smet: There are companies that in an effort to be collaborative become polite and overly involve people just so no one feels offended. And sometimes a good collaboration doesn’t mean that you’re super polite and involve everyone.', 'Leigh Weiss: Aaron, I’m reminded of a consumer-goods company that we served that was a very high-performing company and attracted fantastic talent. And they had one of those cultures where they included people because they didn’t want them to feel left out.', 'And we mapped the decisions that they made and the value of the contributions of each person who was involved. And what we found was that across many decisions—dozens of decisions in the organization—on average, 40 percent of the people involved in the decisions contributed no value. And that wasn’t because they aren’t smart, capable people. It’s just that when a packaging decision was made, an HR person didn’t need to be involved.', 'Simon London: They don’t need to be in the room.', 'Leigh Weiss: They don’t need to be there. When they eliminated the unnecessary people from the meetings, their decisions got faster. They got better. And the employee satisfaction in the organization went way up because people were spending time on the things that mattered.', 'Simon London: Is there actually a rule of thumb? How many people need to be in a decision meeting? At what point does your Spidey sense tell you, “This is out of hand”?', 'Aaron De Smet: I don’t think there is a rule of thumb, actually. One of the things we look at is if there are execution partners involved—people who need to execute the decision. Sometimes you actually move quicker and execute quicker if they’re there. And so [we say to them that] their role is, “Whatever we decide has direct implications on what you’re going to have to do and take action on. And instead of us making the decision and then writing up a memo, you can be right there. When we end, you may not have had much of a role in making the decision. But since you have to execute it, we can now say, ‘OK, all the folks who are here to go execute, do you have any questions? Is it clear? Do you know what the next steps are?’”', 'And so you can take a decision and move immediately into how to act on that decision. So you have as many people as you need. And sometimes, it’s a lot. And other people say, “Oh, you can’t have that many people.” But if they’re going to execute it, and that’s their role, and their role is clear, it will be quicker if they’re in the room. What we try to get rid of is spectators who think, “Well, no, I don’t really have to execute. I just want to be in the loop. I want to be aware and know what’s going on.” It’s like, “OK, you don’t have to be here.”', 'We’ve had decision meetings with 50 people. If you’re really clear who the decision makers are—maybe it’s ten people, or a few, or maybe just one—and everybody else in the room has a clear role to play, and we know what the role is and they know what the role is, great.', 'One of the things we look at is if there are execution partners involved—people who need to execute the decision. Sometimes you actually move quicker and execute quicker if they’re there.', 'Leigh Weiss: We generally identify four roles that are really important for decision meetings. One is, who’s the decision maker? These are the people who actually have a vote. And they jointly align. If they can’t come to a vote and a decision, then they jointly align on a plan to escalate or resolve. The second role is the advisers. These are people who have a critical voice and who are deeply affected by the decision. But they don’t have a vote. The third role is the recommenders.', 'Simon London: Is it right to think about them as subject-matter experts?', 'Aaron De Smet: In some cases. In some case, they have critical expertise or insight or information that will help make a better decision.', 'Simon London: So role clarity in the decision-making process is really helpful just as it is elsewhere in the organization?', 'Aaron De Smet: That’s right. So you have the decision makers. You have the advisers. Another important role is the recommender. Who is actually preparing a recommendation for us to engage on? Because in many cases, you have people in senior roles, and you don’t just want a free for all. You want it structured in some way. Someone who’s saying, “Here are the options we explored. Here are the pros and cons. We recommend option B because of these reasons. This is what it would mean in terms of implications.”', 'Simon London: To be devil’s advocate though, if that’s done really well, do the advisers need to be in the room? Shouldn’t the recommender actually have engaged with all the subject-matter advisers and then synthesized?', 'Aaron De Smet: They probably have. The question is do the decision makers want people in the room to help advise them? And sometimes they do. Sometimes they find that extremely helpful. They say, “Yeah, I want to hear, but if we start going down a path of really discussing and debating, I want to be able to ask questions and dig in. And I want to go direct to the source of the expertise, not the person.”', 'Simon London: And this is your point around decision quality again. If we’re going to have a quality discussion and really kick the tires out on a recommendation, it’s going to be helpful to have the subject-matter experts in the room.', 'Leigh Weiss: Our research showed that the number one predictor of fast, high-quality decisions for big-bet, important decisions that organizations make is the quality of the debate that goes into it.', 'Simon London: So you’ve got your decision makers, your advisers, and you’ve got your recommenders—and then who is the fourth?', 'Leigh Weiss: And the fourth role is execution partners. So Aaron talked about the people who are in the room because their job is going to be implementing or executing on the decision.', 'Simon London: Right. And in practice, what kind of people might they be? Give some examples.', 'Aaron De Smet: So if you are going to make a big decision about changing how we do pricing, let’s say, you might want a number of your commercial and sales and marketing people, even if they don’t have a vote. Even if we don’t need their expertise, that expertise is represented, if they’re going to need to go out and help execute.', 'Simon London: So what kind of people might they be, the execution partners?', 'Aaron De Smet: I mean, it could be any number of things, but if you imagine a company making a big change in how it does pricing, you might want a number of product, marketing, sales, and commercial people who have to help execute that—across geographies, across brands—in the room, because they can help more quickly execute it.', 'They don’t have to be in the room. You can have a formal memo typed up. You can send it out. You can have them email back questions of what they don’t understand. But you will execute much faster. And  one of the pieces of research is that speed matters.', 'So you can have a high-quality decision. And you can feel like you made it quickly.', 'Leigh Weiss: The counterintuitive insight here is that you can move faster by involving more people sometimes.', 'Simon London: Right. And this is why there is no rule of thumb. You can’t say, “More than six people in the room is a problem.” You just have to be really clear about who’s there for what.', 'Aaron De Smet: Yes.', 'Leigh Weiss: What their roles are.', 'Aaron De Smet: More than six decision makers with a vote starts to become a problem. But if you have a bunch of people who you want to go execute and you want them to go fast, it can be extremely helpful to have those people in the room ready to get clear on what they need to go do to make it happen.', 'Here’s a joke that I often tell: Five frogs were on a log. Four decided to jump off. How many were left? And the answer is five, because deciding to do something and actually doing it are different. It’s not just deciding fast. It’s then executing it and moving fast. That’s what you need.', 'Deciding to do something and actually doing it are different. It’s not just deciding fast. It’s then executing it and moving fast.', 'Simon London: So one thing that’s occurring to me is that there is a lot of orchestration and prework required to get this right and figure out who should be there. I’m sure for certain decisions, this can become somewhat routine. But for a lot of decisions, someone’s got to figure out who are the six decision makers? Who are the execution partners? For a big meeting, someone’s got to structure the agenda. Who is that? And does that role exist in organizations?', 'Leigh Weiss: Organizations do this differently. And we’ve seen all flavors of this. It is important to have a role. Many larger, and sometimes smaller, organizations have a chief-of-staff role, whose job it is to coordinate the agendas, the pre-reads, make sure there’s a clear fact base, the right people are there, and the roles are clear.', 'Smaller organizations that don’t always have the budget for that kind of role will still have somebody play it. They’ll just double hat an existing role. Sometimes that might be the chief of strategy. What’s most important is not what the role is but what the person’s skill set is to be able to figure those issues out.', 'Simon London: So who’s a good choice? What kind of person? What are the skills that you need to do it well?', 'Aaron De Smet: It goes back to what is the decision and who’s involved? So certain meetings might be an operational reading. And they’re all operational people. And you say, “OK, who is the right person to own and set the agenda and make sure all the prework is prepped?” And if there’s a pre-read needed, it’s sent out in advance, and it’s clear. The recommenders know what their role is.', 'And there’s certain things that are just helpful in making decisions that we often don’t follow, but these are some of the folks who own the agenda and own the meeting, who can help make sure that those things are followed. If it’s really a series of options that we want to debate, make sure that we present the options.', 'Because often what you see instead is that I present my favorite alternative. I say, “Here’s what we should do.” And the de facto assumption is that the alternative option is to do nothing or continue doing what we’ve been doing. And it may be that that’s just not really an option. We have to do something different.', 'And then almost anything I pick looks better than the default. And we end up picking a bad option. Leigh and I have been running this decision simulation where people are thrown into a meeting. And they have to make a decision. And they have all the information they need to make a good decision.', 'But we set up the meeting structurally to be roughly based on the types of meetings we see. So they fall into all the traps of how not to run a decision meeting. And routinely, those groups make a bad decision. And then we set the meeting up differently and help them clarify their roles and make clear who are the decision makers and how do we want to set it up differently. And suddenly, they end up making a really good decision.', 'Leigh Weiss: With the exact same information.', 'Simon London: So you can prove that the free for all just ends in a bad outcome?', 'Aaron De Smet: It ends in a bad outcome. And it doesn’t look like a free for all.', 'Leigh Weiss: And consistently, the executives who participate in the simulations say, “This is exactly what it feels like when we’re in meetings.”', 'Aaron De Smet: Because they fall into the trap.', 'Simon London: That prompts a thought from me. When you’re observing meetings, either in the simulator or actually out in the field, are there telltale behavioral signs from individuals that you see and you think to yourself, “Huh, although these individuals are present, actually their roles are not very constructive in one way or another.” What are the things that jump out at you?', 'Leigh Weiss: Lots of them. And the obvious one that always pops out is people who are multitasking in the meetings. And they’re on computers or phones or writing some separate notes, and not fully present for the discussion. A second one that always pops out is the one Aaron mentioned a moment ago, people who have individual agendas and don’t want to release their agendas to get to a good decision.', 'So, as an example, I remember working with an advanced industrial company in a meeting where they were making decisions about mid-stage development products—and there were several of them. And every product had its own team. And none of the teams wanted to see their products killed. So there was obfuscating around the fact base or what the data told us about these products and just general advocating for a particular decision based on personal preferences.', 'Simon London: So, in that case, it’s like the advisers, the subject-matter experts, almost not being straight, trying to go beyond their brief, trying to make the decision, and not having an interest in a totally enterprise-level view of the problem?', 'Leigh Weiss: That’s right.', 'Simon London: Anything that comes to mind for you, Aaron?', 'Aaron De Smet: Oh, many. You see people being overly polite. They don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. So they don’t want to disagree. They’ll even use language like, “I don’t disagree, but—” and then they give a very soft disagreement. But it’s so soft that you can choose to ignore it, and so people with a hidden agenda do. And then you’re not having a real debate. And people walk out frustrated.', 'Simon London: By the way, I’m saying “yeah” here, because I’m recognizing myself.', 'Aaron De Smet: It happens. Especially if it develops over time and it gets enculturated. You just see it. Or people who want to be in the loop; they don’t really have a role there, but they want to feel like they’re contributing. They feel the need to say something, so they’ll say something. And it doesn’t really help the discussion. It doesn’t move it forward. Often they’ll be repeating something somebody else said.', 'And different companies have different cultural barriers. But often the cultural barriers manifest in these meetings. And I have seen many, many executives who, at the end of the day, are so tired because they’ve been through so many frustrating meetings. And in many cases, they’re reviewing the same thing. And they’re trying to make a decision. And even when they think they’ve made it, a month later, nothing’s happened.', 'Leigh Weiss: A common meeting culture issue that I see across lots of organizations is the tacit agreement that I won’t mess around in your backyard if you stay out of mine. And then you often get one-on-one discussions between, say, a CEO and a business unit head, where none of the other executives are participating. And then a different one-on-one discussion between a CEO and another business unit head.', 'I remember working with one agricultural company where this happened meeting after meeting. And in one of them, they were talking about introducing a new seed product in Europe. And there had been a tremendous amount of experience with this product in the US. But the US person wasn’t going to say anything because it would have been playing around in the backyard of the European.', 'So none of the information was brought to light. And when they rolled out the new seed product in Europe, they made all of the same mistakes that they had made and corrected in the US. So the implications of these cultural failure modes are really profound for companies.', 'Simon London: As a CEO, if you suspect that’s going on, you suspect that there are cultural failure modes around meeting culture, what do you do? Where do you begin?', 'Leigh Weiss: So I would say it’s not just the job of the CEO to call that out. Anybody who notices that, any executive in an organization, especially at the senior levels—but even middle management and below—should call that out. We know that having good debate leads to better decisions.', 'So what should they do? They can call on other people and solicit perspectives. Another way to do it is to address it head on and say, “Look, I’ve noticed that this is how we do things. And I think that’s undermining our effectiveness. Can we do it differently? And what would it take from each of you?”', 'Simon London: So just tackle it head on, call it out, name it?', 'Aaron De Smet: One of the things I typically recommend when I get this question is to go through the meetings that you own or can influence and figure out if that is a decision meeting or something else. What is the purpose of that meeting? If it is a decision meeting, you probably need to change it quite a lot. If it’s just an information-sharing meeting, that’s fine. But if it’s a decision meeting, here’s what you should do. Number one, you should figure out what are the decisions that are meant to be made in this meeting? Then you should make sure that the bulk of the time is spent on that, not on the other stuff.', 'And maybe it’s for multiple decisions. That’s fine. Just say what they are. And for any meeting on the agenda, list which agenda items are for information, which agenda items are working sessions—where we’re getting input, we’re shaping, we’re problem solving—and which are actually the decision-making parts of the meeting.', 'And try to make sure that 80 percent of the time is spent on the decision if it’s a decision meeting, not the other stuff. Because if you need a long time on doing real work and getting input, that’s probably a separate working session with a different group of people. If it’s just information sharing, there are other mechanisms that are more efficient. You just email things out or hold townhalls.', 'Simon London: So again, it’s this issue of scope creep, particularly with recurring meetings. Over time they attract a kind of bloat and people lose sight of “what’s this meeting for?”', 'Leigh Weiss: This often happens when you’ve got a recurring meeting and the meeting is coming up—it’s happening in two weeks. And somebody goes out and solicits topics for the agenda. We have a meeting. We better figure out what the topics are because we’ve got to use people’s time well.', 'Aaron De Smet: If it’s a decision meeting and you don’t have a decision to be made just cancel it. Give people their time back. The other thing I would say is, in the agenda, not only use 80 percent of the time on decision topics but also state the decision and actually name who the decision makers are for that decision.', 'Leigh Weiss: And I would say also one of the good practices that I’ve seen is after a decision is reached or when you’re getting closer, ask each person who is a decision maker, one by one, “Can you commit to this decision?”— so that you get their commitment to follow through.', 'After a decision is reached or when you’re getting closer, ask each person who is a decision maker, one by one, “Can you commit to this decision?”— so that you get their commitment to follow through.', 'Aaron De Smet: Notice she didn’t ask, “Do you agree with the decision?”', 'Simon London: No, it’s like, “Do you commit?” It’s that Jeff Bezos thing, isn’t it?', 'Aaron De Smet: It is exactly that.', 'Simon London: It’s disagree then commit.', 'Aaron De Smet: The two decision makers have said this is the decision they want to make. Can you commit to executing and following through and supporting it? Can you commit? Can you commit? Can you commit? And if everybody says they can commit and the decision makers are aligned, you’re good.', 'Simon London: It’s likely to happen.', 'Aaron De Smet: It very likely will happen.', 'Simon London: Yeah. Can we just map this back to the topic of our previous podcast? We were talking about different types of decisions. And I think you identified three primary ones, which are, number one, the big bets that don’t come along frequently but are big set pieces. The more complicated big decisions—but regular cross-functional, cross-organizational decisions. And then finally, delegated decisions. How does what we’ve been talking about here map to that? Do you approach these different decision types in different ways?', 'Aaron De Smet: You do. The first thing we found is there are three things that make for better decisions regardless of decision type. Number one is to make it at the right level. Do not constantly escalate decisions up to the most senior levels for approval. Also, don’t delegate decisions too low in the organization. You have to figure out what is the appropriate level for this decision to be made and who should be involved.', 'The second is to make sure the people making the decision are very clear on not just their own siloed goals and targets but also the enterprise strategy. What is the value-creation agenda for the whole company? And the third is what Leigh was just talking about: make sure that you get commitment from the people who need to be involved, who are either affected by the decision or who have to help execute it.', 'Simon London: Those are basic decision hygiene?', 'Aaron De Smet: Those are just basic. That’s decision hygiene. Beyond that, the most important thing suddenly changes depending on what type of decision it is. I’ll invite Leigh to give a couple of examples. I’ll start us off with delegated decisions.', 'If you find that one person can make this decision, you should delegate to that person and not have a meeting. And if they want to consult people, they are free to do so. But you need to empower them and help them make the right decision. And often leaders are not good at empowering people. They’re, in fact, really bad at it.', 'Leigh Weiss: So the decisions meetings we’ve been talking about are not really relevant to the delegated decisions. They’re much more relevant to both the big-bet and the cross-functional decisions. Interestingly, what we found in our research is that for the big-bet decisions, companies overall feel like they’re doing OK, that they’re making good and high-quality decisions.', 'Where they struggle much more is with these cross-functional, cross-organizational decisions that cut across boundaries. And I think it’s those two types of decisions—the big-bet, but especially the cross-functional—where the discussion we’ve been having about how to set up a good meeting for decisions is most relevant.', 'Simon London: So I’m going to put a hypothesis on the table, which is that for the big-bet decisions, whether it’s called a chief of staff or effectively it is a chief of staff, somebody takes the time and trouble to really orchestrate it because it gets that level of attention. I suspect that for most regular cross-functional decisions, it’s really unclear who that chief of staff is. And therefore, this level of orchestration and preparation and clarity just doesn’t happen.', 'Aaron De Smet: I would start by clarifying that big-bet decisions are any decisions that have broad implications in the organization. It’s not something we make all the time. And in that sense, if it’s important enough, you typically find that a lot of resources get put on it, teams get assigned a chief of staff, or some kind of manager gets put on it. I think the bigger challenge there is that companies are starting to find that their current processes for doing that are too slow or invite too much bias. And one of the things that companies can do for their big-bet decisions is find ways to go faster that also reduce bias. And there are lots of ways to do that. But generally, companies are not saying, “We just can’t make a good decision.” They’re making reasonably good decisions. They’re just a little too slow. And sometimes they do make mistakes, because they allow for too much bias. And those are two really important things for the big bet. The cross-cutting decisions isn’t about getting everyone in a room to make the decision. That one is more about figuring out the steps involved and who’s involved in each step.', 'One of the things that typically happens for these cross-functional decisions that are not at a discrete point in time is that different people are involved in different ways in different parts of the process. I’ll give an example.', 'A typical cross-cutting process for any manufacturer of actual products is sales and operations planning. And that is not a single-point decision. How many blue widgets are we going to make and have in Asia in Q3? Nobody at the beginning of the year says, “This is exactly right.” You have a whole process that asks, “What is our unconstrained demand forecast? If it’s constrained, what does that mean? If the price changes, what does that mean?” You have various scenarios. You plug it into an operational plan and your manufacturing and supply chain. And over time, it evolves. If you try to get everybody who touches that decision involved in making the decision at a single point in time, it’ll just stop.', 'Simon London: Yeah, it’s just not going to work.', 'Leigh Weiss: You can’t do it. There’s also time that needs to happen in between.', 'Aaron De Smet: So the clarity of the process of who’s in, what are the steps, who’s involved when, and who makes which decision at what point, and when it gets stuck or when there’s an exception or when something happens, how does it get escalated and quickly resolved—that’s really what you need to figure out there.', 'Simon London: It’s like a therapy. It’s like making the unconscious conscious. You need to actually say, “All right, everybody knows in theory how this gets made, now write it down, map it, tell me how does this get made?”', 'Leigh Weiss: That is the number one predictor of success for these cross-cutting decisions.', 'Aaron De Smet: And once you’ve mapped it, practice it enough that you don’t need to go look up the RACI [responsibility-assignment matrix]. Nobody looks up the RACI before they do something. When someone sends them an email, they don’t go look up a RACI.', 'Simon London: And the RACI is who’s responsible, who’s accountable.', 'Aaron De Smet: Which is, by the way, not that helpful anyway. But it’s helpful to clarify roles for sure.', 'Leigh Weiss: What we often find is most helpful is that after you map a clear process, get the different stakeholders in a room to run water through the pipes and check that the process makes sense and everybody knows who has which role at what point in time.', 'Simon London: Right. So you might workshop it?', 'Aaron De Smet: You workshop it. And then they’re like, “Oh, so that’s how we’re going to do that? OK. And if this comes up, when that exception happens, we do it a little differently. OK, I get it.”', 'Simon London: And then you take it out into the field. So we are not recommending some overengineered process mapping for every last cross-functional decision, because you’re just going to end up with a big messy binder. And no one’s going to look at it.', 'Aaron De Smet: Exactly.', 'Leigh Weiss: That’s right.', 'Aaron De Smet: For delegated decisions, interestingly, companies that aren’t used to really empowering people—sometimes the people who we’re trying to empower—don’t want it. Because if you’re going to empower them, you need to hold them accountable. And some people are like, “Well, I’ve not been accountable for this decision for a long time.”', 'Leigh Weiss: This goes back to our discussion about what kind of behaviors you tend to see around decision making. And you see all kinds of obfuscating. And if a decision’s been delegated to me, I might try everything I can to get Aaron to make the decision if he’s the one who delegated it to me. I’ll say sneaky things like, “Well, what would you do if you found this out or you were in my shoes?” Or I’ll form a committee to get people to make the decision.', 'Aaron De Smet: One of the biggest culprits of all these meetings is people who have the clear decision right—it’s been delegated to an individual, and they are afraid. They are afraid to make the decision because they feel like if they make a wrong decision, they will be exposed and punished in some way.', 'Simon London: But there’s a fine line here, isn’t there? Because on the one hand, you want people to have someone to consult, right? So you do want that. You want them to get input from the appropriate parties. But yeah, you don’t want them to hide behind it. So getting that balance right is the key.', 'Leigh Weiss: Yeah, I think it’s one of the most troubling phenomena I see in organizations around decision making. This lack of desire to really have accountability for a decision. Because it feels so risky. And I can imagine some of the factors, although I’m not sure what all of them are, that make people feel so afraid of making decisions, and it’s so hard for leaders at the top to ensure accountability.', 'Aaron De Smet: In a small, scrappy start-up, where the odds are against them being successful anyway, you see people playing to win. They’re like, “We probably aren’t going to be successful, so let’s be bold. If we’re not bold, we’re never going to succeed.”', 'And so you see people being rewarded for just going fast, making a call. If they consult the right people and are thoughtful, they’re not expected to be perfect. At some point, companies grow big enough and successful enough and have a track record, and someone comes into a role that’s been held by five people before them. And they’re working for someone who used to have this job.', 'And they kind of implicitly, unconsciously, start playing not to lose. They start saying, “I just don’t want to make a bad decision. If it is a bad decision, I don’t want to be on the one who made it. I want everybody to feel like they made it.”', 'Leigh Weiss: What do you think is driving that?', 'Aaron De Smet: I think they feel like they’ve come into a successful company and a successful role. And they just don’t want to mess up. And they feel like the mess-ups are the ones that get noticed.', 'Leigh Weiss: Because there’s very little upside to making a good decision—and a lot of downside.', 'Aaron De Smet: If there’s a track record of things going well and your good decision is just part of that track record, it often goes unnoticed and unrewarded. And so I make a decision ten times, and the first nine times it goes just fine and smooth, but the tenth time it doesn’t go smooth; something happens, and it goes wrong. And then my boss comes and says, “I would not have made that decision.” Now I get punished.', 'Leigh Weiss: This takes us back to the issue of what works well for delegated decisions, which is bosses who, when they delegate a decision, don’t just leave an employee alone to make it; they provide some guidelines, they provide swim lanes for what success would look like. They coach the person to whom the decision has been delegated.', 'Aaron De Smet: Without making it for them, they coach them.', 'Simon London: Exactly. And that was my point about the delicate balance.', 'Aaron De Smet: That’s right. It is a delicate balance, as is also realizing that nobody’s going to be perfect and make it exactly right every time. And so when you look at if a bad decision is made and there are bad outcomes involved, one of the things a leader should look at is “Well, what is the whole portfolio of decisions they’ve been making? Did this somehow get to a level of unfamiliarity or go beyond a threshold where they should have escalated it—where it involved a bunch of other people?”', 'And sometimes the answer is no, it just happened to be not a good call. By the way, you see this all the time. You see it in sports. In American football, for a long time the statistics have said that on fourth down, teams should go for it way more often than they do. And why don’t they? Because when they go for it and don’t make it, the coach feels bad.', 'Simon London: It’s a headline.', 'Aaron De Smet: They think, “I’d rather just punt it.” So that phenomena in sports is even more pervasive in corporate America. People would rather punt than go for it.', 'Simon London: That’s right. And there’s a reason why that metaphor “punt the decision” has become quite commonplace.', 'Aaron De Smet: People punt way too often.', 'Simon London: All right. So I think we are out of time for today. But that was fascinating.

But rapid revenue recovery is exactly the kind of phrase we’ve found many executives—and frankly, our clients—coming to us with as the pandemic emerged and as it has persisted. Rapid meaning as fast as humanly possible. Revenue meaning the top line—sales and how to get that engine going again. And then recovery because, let’s face it, a lot of the uncertainty out there has forced a lot of companies to be in recovery-and-crisis mode. So that’s why they all come together.', 'In terms of what’s changed since we published our article a couple of months back, the answer is, a lot. This is where, Aimee, I’d love to hear your perspective coming at it from Asia. In North America, we’ve learned quite a bit. For one, since this whole pandemic began, we’ve seen consumers have drastically changed. Talk about an epic human experiment, right? Putting aside for a moment the crisis itself and the humanitarian loss that we’re all witnessing—if you just look at this from a true behavioral change shift, it’s quite extraordinary. What we’re seeing with consumers right now is they’re not just trading down.', 'Diane Brady: Going to generic versions of what we used to buy from big brands?', 'Brian Gregg: Going to generic versions, looking for the lower price points—essentially, consumers looking to only buy what they needed for the lowest price possible.', 'What we’re seeing now—in this particular, very unique situation—is consumers trading, period. Not just trading down but also trading from offline physical shopping to online. Trading from brands that they used to know and trust to new brands that they might either see and discover online or ones that are offering different propositions around safety and hygiene. So it’s really a moment to just step back and recognize what’s happened in the last 90 days: something that has really never been seen before on a consumer front. And we’ve learned quite a bit from that human experiment.', 'Diane Brady: So Aimee, given those changes, it would seem that growth is potentially more difficult now than it was when you wrote the article.', 'Aimee Kim: I think the answer will be quite different by geography. Even within Asia, we have some markets where the lockdown is pretty much still in full force, whereas we also have markets like China where the average Chinese consumer would argue that business is pretty much as usual, setting aside the travel restrictions.', 'So I do think that, slowly but surely, a lot of companies have figured out how to crack the code and really reengage this very changed consumer, as Brian just described. So growth is not only possible, it is happening. I do want to emphasize that the traits that Brian described are absolutely true for Asian consumers as well.', 'If anything, if we tie that with the growth question that you just raised, Diane, the companies that are able to capture the imagination, engage the consumer—the new consumer, who has completely different expectations about what hygiene means in physical retail, what delivery speeds mean—on the e-commerce side, those are the companies that will really win.', 'One more thing I would add is that this pandemic has been probably the biggest onboarding exercise for e-commerce. In Asia, we’re seeing the last consumer segments who were holding off in embracing e-commerce have really been forced to buy online. I’m referring to people who are typically older: mid-50s and above. They had their favorite shop in the neighborhood that they would frequent and were really resistant about buying online. The e-retailers that have been able to deliver a good experience are able to retain these consumers. The channel mix in the landscape going forward has completely changed.', 'Diane Brady: I think of that Shakespeare quote, Brian, “Some are born great, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” It seems like digital would be a good analogy here, where everybody went digital, but some seemed to do it a little better than others.', 'Brian Gregg: Oh, for sure, Diane. What we’re talking about now is a K-shaped recovery.', 'Diane Brady: K-shaped? I’ve never heard of a K-shaped recovery.', 'The [companies] that are taking a slower time to pivot and reground themselves in a digital-first world are, of course, having a much harder time.', 'Brian Gregg: Well, let me try and paint the vision here and see how clear it becomes. If you think of the two legs of a “K,” there’s one that points up and one that goes in the opposite direction. And to your Shakespearean quote, those who are either already positioned well in a digital world or those who have been able to quickly rapidly pivot there, those are the ones on the good side of the K, meaning going up.', 'The ones that are taking a slower time to pivot and reground themselves in a digital-first world are, of course, having a much harder time with this. This is going to be a moment that separates, more so than ever, the winners and the others. And it’s this digital shift that Aimee’s talking about that’s the biggest separator.', 'Aimee Kim: We refer to it as really exposing the winners versus the losers. And it’s really become a situation where there’s nowhere to hide. The companies that have been investing in digital capabilities, that have been thinking about how to connect online and offline, those are the ones that are really emerging. And [they are] actually accelerating growth amid this pandemic, whereas the companies who have been a bit less aggressive or proactive on that front are really feeling the pain in many cases.', 'Diane Brady: What are the aspects that really have made a big difference? Is it that last mile of how quickly they get my stuff to me or is it other factors that are causing that separation? Brian?', 'Brian Gregg: We looked at this very question because so many of our own clients and executives and boards are asking similar questions. And while this is still new, and the cement is certainly still wet, what our research is starting to show is that there are five markers of what companies who are on the upshift here are doing versus those who aren’t.', 'The first one we already talked about—those who are able to truly embrace this digital surge. That’s absolutely marker number one.', 'The second one is one we’re referring to as the granularity of recovery, which is essentially companies that are able to get much more granular about how they capture demand when it’s there; that’s a winning trait. Here in the United States, as an example, I had one client the other day say, “This isn’t one virus, this is 50 viruses.” And if you actually break it down, it’s 500 viruses. Because the way consumers are ready to buy and shop is a very localized decision right now.', 'Diane Brady: So it’s customization and data? Is that the differentiator in that category?', 'Brian Gregg: It is. The ability to get granular, to personalize and customize at a local level, is the differentiator there. That’s a second example, or a second marker.', 'The third one we found is this element we’re calling virtual agility. Many workforces have been forced to go virtual, as many know. But the ability to stay fast, rapid, and be able to respond in the moment—and I’m not talking about quarterly business reviews; I’m talking about daily, hourly shifts and pivots in which you focus your resources—that’s the third marker of what we’re really seeing successful companies do.', 'The fourth one, we’re calling business model reimagination; this idea that, while you have to manage the crisis in front of you, [it’s also important to have] the ability to step back from that and imagine that when we do emerge out of this current pandemic, what will be the business model shifts that are going to be there, and how do you take advantage or participate in those now?', 'And then, we call the fifth and final marker self-funded growth, which is basically saying, how do you use this moment to truly rewrite the entire P&L [profit and loss] and places where you’ve always wanted to make shifts as a company? Now’s a great moment. Rip the Band-Aid off and save money that maybe wasn’t being directed in the right places. And use those dollars to invest in growth. So self-fund your own growth curve.', 'Diane Brady: How are those markers playing out in Asia, Aimee? There doesn’t seem to be a lot of money around, but there’s certainly a lot of pain.', 'Aimee Kim: There is a lot of pain, Diane. I think some players in Asia have still been able to weather the storm and are really doing well. I’ll just talk about a few of the five markers that Brian alluded to; for instance, granularity. In China, there are digital agencies that will be able to pinpoint a consumer’s physical location within two meters. So they literally are able to track a consumer who’s roaming in a department store [and see] which beauty counter she is in front of. And coupling that type of geolocation data with the consumer’s spend data, with other data like these digital breadcrumbs that brands are collecting about their individual consumers, allows certain companies to really do personalized marketing like never before.', 'And so it really is super granular. Virtual agility is also the name of the game. Again, I’ll give you an example [from China] during the lockdown, and we’re talking about literally one or two weeks after the initial situation in Wuhan occurred: a Chinese mobility player was able to run thousands of campaigns in a super agile way in order to pinpoint what really worked for different consumers. And it was able to protect 90 percent of the revenues during the lockdown, whereas the average Chinese business was looking at 10 percent, if they were lucky.', 'Diane Brady: Wow. How are they doing now? Did they continue on that trajectory?', 'Aimee Kim: Oh, absolutely. They’re doing very, very well. And eating their competitors up day by day. One common theme, if we step back and look at these winning players, is the fact that they actually were sitting on a lot of consumer data, and they really understood their consumer.', 'If you ask me, [the one factor] underpinning the requirement to really excel on these five markers of future success is definitely understanding your consumer. Earlier you asked, is it about the last mile? Is it about having a good fulfillment system? All of those are extremely important, but it all starts from understanding what the consumer wants.', 'Really understanding what the consumer values and quickly pivoting your business model and your services to cater to that is how you weather the storm and continue to grow.', 'For instance, we know from our research that despite all the talk about fast delivery, many more consumers are far more interested in and demanding about transparency or visibility. So it’s much more important to be able to track where their parcel is as opposed to getting it immediately. And so really understanding what the consumer values and quickly pivoting your business model and your services to cater to that is how you weather the storm and continue to grow in this situation.', 'Diane Brady: It feels like the consumer mindset around data has changed a bit. We’re more willing to do track and trace. We’re more interested in personalization. Brian, have you found that to be the case, and is that an opportunity that brands need to explore?', 'Brian Gregg: Well, the truth on the data acceptance and the privacy concerns that consumers have had is that there was always a threshold for which consumers would be willing to give their data, right? And as long as the value exchange is there, consumers will be willing to give more and more. What this pandemic has brought upon many segments and cohorts of consumers is a different set of values that they’re looking for—for instance, guarantees of safety and wanting to know how much contact is going to have to happen in order to have a transaction completed.', 'These are all things that weren’t even on the hierarchy of needs less than a year ago and now, all of a sudden, have catapulted to the top. And so in that world, what is new and what is different is consumers’ willingness to give information about themselves, where they live, and who they are for guarantees on some of these new needs.', 'Diane Brady: It does feel like that is an area where we see a geographic divide. Aimee, what do you find, in terms of the different markets you look at?', 'Aimee Kim: I think there’s a general acceptance that sharing your personal data is really required at times in order to protect the broader social health and welfare. So in most Asian markets during the pandemic, I think the government, private companies, and individual consumers are all beginning to stack hands and are much more open to doing this.', 'And it’s because, as Brian just mentioned, there’s this fundamental belief that there’s value—there’s something coming back to me individually—in doing that. I think what’s interesting is that it’s not a one-way street. Consumers obviously are a bit more open in providing their information, whether it’s in return for a personalized marketing campaign that is really valuable to them or it’s because it’s extremely convenient for them, and so forth. But retailers are also much more proactive in some instances in sharing their information. For example, the other day, I was chuckling because one of our team members had ordered lunch, and the online delivery system had stapled a piece of paper on the lunch box, and it literally had the body temperature of all the employees that had touched the box. It doesn’t get better than that.', 'Diane Brady: Yes, that’s good lunchtime reading. Tell me a bit, Brian, about the conversations you’re hearing from CEOs—and even about that category of reimagination. It feels aspirational at this point. Are people still in crisis mode?', 'Brian Gregg: It does depend. But this pandemic has been with us now for—depending on what country or what city you’re in—five, six, seven months. And at a certain point, there’s just fatigue that starts to set in. I was speaking to a CEO of a retailer just this past week who was commenting on how to reach an element of sustainability with the maniacal focus that the crisis forces upon a retailer. This is a retailer that had to shut all their stores just three months ago. What he was saying to me was, “We did all the scenario planning you’d ever hope for, but in not one scenario did I ever plan for all our stores to be shut and for every shopper to have to stay home for almost a year.”', 'And he said, “The one thing I’m betting on right now is our ability to not only manage through the crisis today, tomorrow, or the next day but also pull our heads up and to think, ‘What’s this going to look like next year and the year after?’” He added, “Brian, what I’ve got to think through is what if stores never open? Or what if this vaccine doesn’t happen for two, three years? I hope it’s not true, but I have to plan for that.”', 'And that’s where his business-model-reimagination insight started to come in: “Where will I, therefore, be able to engage my consumer, and where will I actually earn operating profit? How does that look completely different if stores never do open?” So he’s asked his team to spend the time on all the things that take real time, even though today they’re managing through door openings and getting employees back in. He’s asked them to reserve resources for imagining 2022 to 2023: “How do we shift our business model accordingly?”', 'Diane Brady: Wow, I picture myself sitting in my living room for two years. Doesn’t sound like an opportunity for me to buy, but Aimee, what are some of the more innovative models? It’s not simply just e-commerce continuing, is it?', 'Aimee Kim: It isn’t. A lot of brands are thinking about how to engage the consumer other than through e-commerce because that’s not the only way consumers in their natural element want to engage and experience the brand. There is a role for the physical store. So how does that store have to change?', 'A lot of discussions we’re having these days is about rethinking the format of the store. Does it have to be a big store, which typically draws in a lot of crowds? Will consumers be comfortable in that setting? Or do you want to reduce the number of large formats and actually have smaller stores that are much more in the neighborhood so that the customer doesn’t have to travel long distances, or take a subway, or go through mass transport and again be exposed to the crowds?', 'So there’s a lot of thinking not only about pivoting completely to online but also about how you change your existing store format to make it much more comfortable and convenient for the customer to visit. One Japanese shopping mall operator, for example, is taking this opportunity to completely rethink their tenant strategy. And they’re using advanced analytics to forecast what type of product categories will still be sought in the offline environment because the product is something that consumers will want to touch and feel before making a purchase. They’re deciding, “Maybe we should increase our tenant mix in those categories.” [They’re also asking:] “What type of tenants do we probably think will go predominantly online? And we should probably reduce that tenant mix.”', 'Going back to managing operating profits, a lot of mall operators are thinking up much more flexible and dynamic schemes in how they will charge their rents. Because they understand that everyone is under pain. So sticking to a very classic, rigid rental scheme probably does not work. We’re seeing a lot of experimentation and imagination among retailers who are trying to get ahead of the curve.', 'There’s a lot of thinking not only about pivoting completely to online but also about how you change your existing store format to make it much more comfortable and convenient for the customer to visit.', 'Diane Brady: I am intrigued even by the notion, Brian, that loyalty appears to be dead. First, is it dead? How are people rebuilding it?', 'Brian Gregg: I wouldn’t go as far as saying it’s dead. I think it’s been shocked. It’s been jolted. All of the assumptions that guided predictive models on which brands were going to win have really been thrown out. Just think about it. We’re finding in our consumer research that 75 percent of consumers report changing either a brand, a retailer they shop, or a place they start their journey. The amount of human routine and behavioral change that’s happened in the last 90 days is just unprecedented.', 'Think about the grocery sector. Grocery is as tried and true as retail gets. Everybody has their go-to. It’s either three blocks away or three miles away. They know their cash register person. They know other folks. We found that 25 percent of consumers are reporting they’ve changed their grocer in the last 60 days. This is what I mean by a time of true routine shift and behavioral change. And so inside of that—your question about consumer loyalty—we’re finding that a significant proportion of consumer shifting is sticking.', 'The game board is up for grabs. You could argue that 20 percent of customers in any individual category are going to shift and stick. What I think what that means, and the implication for management teams, is setting your aspiration high. Ask yourself, “How do I get on the right side of that K-shaped recovery?” This isn’t about incrementalism. [Ask yourself:] “How do I maintain my momentum or maybe add one or two share points. How do we truly change the game?” How do you go from a number three player to a number one, or add 20 points of market share in the next, call it, 12 months? Those aren’t crazy conversations to have, and we’re finding a number of management teams, likely those on the offense, having those discussions.', 'Diane Brady: Well, what if I’m a little late to the game, Aimee, and I perhaps was not as quick or as deep in my investments? Tactically, I now have to set priorities. What are the areas that really move the needle right now?', 'Aimee Kim: I think anything that has a direct interface with the consumer is where you want to start. As Brian mentioned, a lot of consumers are going through a fundamental shift. And the stickiness is determined on how good the experience was.', 'So instead of trying to do heavy lifting on completely redesigning your global supply-chain network, I would start with the interface between you and the consumer, and go back from that point. Because if you try to do too much within these very challenging times, you may end up not really delivering on any one dimension above and beyond the competition. The rule of the game is to really focus sharply and start where it is a noticeable change to the end consumer.', 'Diane Brady: We hear a lot about how Gen Z engages. Are there surprises along the line as to what perhaps we thought baby boomers, Gen X, millennials, or others have done that may be changing right now? Brian?', 'Brian Gregg: We are seeing a couple things across the board with some of the cohorts you mention. We are seeing Gen Zers spending even more time on digital media than the other cohorts. We’re also seeing baby boomers and some of the older generations actually being the ones to almost discover digital and its capabilities and sticking with it more so than the other generations. What surprised us is we’re finding that two cohorts in particular are the most promiscuous, if I can use that word, on where they’re spending their time and what brands they’re sticking with. We’re finding that both the Gen Z cohort as well as the higher-income cohort are the two that are most likely to change brands or retailers.', 'If you think about brands who are always pursuing that next generation, the younger generation, of consumers or those with higher income, those are really the two battlegrounds that perhaps are the most challenging, given the environment that this pandemic has caused.', 'Diane Brady: What are the battlegrounds you’re watching in Asia, Aimee?', 'Aimee Kim: I think those are similar to what Brian just mentioned. One thing that’s quite pronounced in Asia is video streaming. So even, surprisingly, with baby boomers and the older generation who, through this pandemic, have been onboarded into e-commerce, even with that segment, the way they want to absorb information online to make a purchase is really skewed toward video streaming. It’s come to a point where the brands have, during this pandemic, very aggressively reallocated their digital marketing spend to try to excel in platforms where video streaming is the norm.', 'Diane Brady: Because I am the daughter of a salesman, I do think that all of life is marketing and sales, which is, of course, not technically true. But on an individual level, are there lessons that we can take from even how the two of you are behaving differently? Brian, I’m going to start with you. What are you doing differently in terms of your own consumption?', 'Brian Gregg: It’s a great question of reflection. If you’d asked me this six months ago, the answer would have been different from three months ago, would have been different from now. But I do think there’s a real resilience that’s forced all of us to really reflect on this crisis.', 'And to really think about how you reframe it into an opportunity—for self-growth, for resilience, or for, in my case, not getting on an airplane as much. So how do I redeploy the time to ensure that I’m with family a little bit more or spending time with my client base to help them through this time?', 'So the first thing is just reframing what might be given to you as lemons and really trying to squeeze the lemonade. I think the second thing that at least I’m trying to apply to my daily life is just the sustainability point, because boy, this—to me—came a little bit out of nowhere.', 'Diane Brady: Well, you’re in California. Of course there’s still wildfires, and that might have been a factor.', 'Brian Gregg: I’m now recognizing the importance of just simple things like clean oxygen but also of being able to get to a point where you force a different operating model, just as at the enterprise level. Many management teams are trying to hit a new speed and a new agility in their own ways of working. But [you should also be] thinking about your own operating model, setting barriers for when and when not to be working, and thinking about operating at multiple speeds.', 'It’s a very valuable lesson of how to manage the here and now but also to think a year or two years ahead in a world scenario where nothing’s clear. And then maybe the last thing I’ll just say is, since you mentioned the wildfires, I personally have just realized how important it is to embrace gratitude for every moment. And I joke because just a month ago, I was sitting around, complaining about the pandemic—how long’s it going to be, how many lives are really at risk, and how it’s really a detrimental situation—and then the fires come.', 'Walking around San Francisco, I see so many people out and smiling. And why? It’s because there’s clean oxygen. The sun actually rose in the morning. We had blue skies. So it shows you the power of really being thankful for what you do have— and in a time where that’s really an important thing.', 'Diane Brady: Climate awareness is changing consumer patterns, as well. You certainly hear companies talk about that. Aimee, what about yourself?', 'Aimee Kim: Brian’s points resonate with me personally. On a practical dimension, it’s really managing against churn and fatigue. Initially, when we were caught by the pandemic—you know, by surprise, even internally—as a firm, we had, and Brian knows this, countless webinars, with good intentions, to try to hold the hands of our clients, many of whom were really getting anxious, for good reason, and also [had webinars] among ourselves.', 'We were all just so surprised. Sitting here in Asia, quite frequently I would be doing webinars and podcasts in the wee hours of the evening. And these things take their toll. I think we have to pay attention to the advice that we give our clients, which is not to go into overdrive or panic mode but to step back and really rethink: What does this mean, in the short term and the long term, in terms of my operating model? And what boundaries between professional life and personal life am I going to set? Otherwise, things quickly become unsustainable. So on a practical level, I think it’s really protecting against fatigue and churn.', 'The second component would be perhaps changing the first “r” in rapid revenue recovery to reimagining revenue recovery. Because I think this is all about reimagining a new future, a new way of life. And so it’s a very precious opportunity for us to all look back and embrace change and do things differently.', 'Diane Brady: In terms of just tying the loop a little bit back to that growth question, it feels a little like we’re in a winner-take-all society at times when it comes to e-commerce. How optimistic are your clients about the opportunities they see going forward? Brian?', 'I will tell you this: I have been impressed with the amount of resilience that I’ve seen across the board.', 'Brian Gregg: I think it would be unfair to say everybody’s optimistic. It really depends on the individual company and the individual management team. But I will tell you this: I have been impressed with the amount of resilience that I’ve seen across the board—in all kinds of sectors and in all kinds of management teams—and with the basic humanity, and frankly, teamwork that has been exhibited in the last six to nine months, the willingness to do whatever it takes, both to keep the business alive but also to serve consumers—to do what’s right in their local communities and to really serve the broader good.', 'It’s been a very touching moment in our history, not only from a business perspective, but also from an overall humanity perspective. I’m quite proud of the way the private sector and businesses in general have responded to that. From that standpoint, stepping back and looking at the entire community, I’m very optimistic about what lies ahead.', 'Diane Brady: Great. Help us look around the corner. I’ll go to you first, Brian, and then Aimee. What’s intriguing that’s on your radar?', 'Brian Gregg: I always am having conversations with executives about looking around the corner. One thing is to recognize the potential in what this moment represents, both for the company and for your brand, or for your enterprise and the market. This is a moment we’ll look back on historically and say, “Remember when...?” And what you want to make sure you’re doing is saying, “I as a leader and we as a team used this time to do X.”', 'The second thing is that there’s no time like the present, right? I think this is a pretty obvious point in many cases. But it is a time to act now—and with purpose and with ambition and with boldness. And what is exciting about these kinds of moments is not only do they not come very often but also it’s a time when teams come together and really make bold moves.', 'So that’d be the second thing to look around the corner and say, “Are we being bold enough?” And asking yourself, “Have we accomplished everything we’d like to accomplish, given this is a once-in-100-year type of event?” And then the final thing I’ll say would be looking around the corner, this is a time to really reflect on what the future of the company is going to look like and not just be in crisis mode, as Aimee and I have said, but to be able to really shape the future of the organization you’re leading.', 'Diane Brady: Aimee, as you look around the corner, what do you see?', 'Aimee Kim: The discussions that I’m having with my clients about what the future is and how the future can be different is really about do you want to be a responding company or a reacting company, or do you want to be a shaper? And I think the more we can encourage our clients to be bold [the better]. It’s a scary time, but it is an opportunity. And in a certain sense, how they spend time and how they reshape their strategy for the next six to 12 months will have really long-lasting consequences in what type of company or brand emerges in the future. So again, the question is, are you reacting or are you shaping?', 'Diane Brady: Great advice. Brian, Aimee, thank you very much for your thoughts.', 'Brian Gregg: Thank you, Diane.', 'Aimee Kim: Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: That was Brian Gregg in San Francisco and Aimee Kim in Seoul.

Here’s how companies can manage through the crisis and build resilience against future shocks.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with Edward Barriball and Susan Lund about how the COVID-19 crisis has affected global supply chains and how various industries are faring.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady, in New York. If you’ve tried to buy a bicycle in recent months, like I have and failed to do, or you recall the great toilet-paper shortage earlier this year, you already know about the importance of the supply chain. That’s what we’re talking about today with two partners here at McKinsey who’ve worked on a groundbreaking study on the risks and resilience in the global supply chain or, as they put it, the global value chain.', 'Joining me are Susan Lund—she’s a partner at  the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington,  DC—and also joining me from Washington, DC, is Ed Barriball, a partner in the Manufacturing and Supply Chain service line within the Operations Practice, who’s worked on many of these issues across both the public and the private sectors. Susan and Ed, welcome.', 'Ed Barriball: Thank you, Diane.', 'Susan Lund: Thank you.', 'Diane Brady: Susan, I know about supply chains. What do we mean by value chain?', 'Susan Lund: A value chain takes the perspective all the way from where materials are mined, the metals that are created, how they pass through the system, and then finally how the final good gets to the customer. So a supply chain will be defined by a company, and it might include their first tier of suppliers. It might even include the suppliers of those suppliers. But very rarely do companies think of their supply chain as going all the way back to where do the raw materials come from and how do they come together at each step. So when we say value chain, we mean that whole process, from the mine to the end consumer.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting because the pandemic has brought this to being a consumer issue. Ed—I’ll start with you, but Susan too—what has been the impact of the pandemic? What’s different about it?', 'Ed Barriball: I think this is one of the most significant shocks that global supply chains have faced, really, since we started to globalize, decades ago. The reason that we undertook this work is because shocks like what’s happened with the coronavirus are becoming more and more frequent and common. But this is certainly what the coronavirus really highlighted—the impact that shocks can have on these global supply chains. And so in terms of what it’s done—I mean, I think it’s actually, to Susan’s point around value chains—it’s had a huge impact not just on the ability to get supply from your suppliers in different countries around the world but also what’s happening with the end consumer in these value chains.', 'So you referenced toilet paper at the start. All of a sudden, people were buying a lot more toilet paper than you needed for your house, and office toilet-paper demand was completely down through the floor. And because of that, you had people who couldn’t get toilet paper. And so it’s been both a demand surge in some areas that has really put strain on supply chains, not just demand drop-off and not just a supply problem. So it’s truly been across the entire value chain that you’ve seen the impact.', 'Diane Brady: Susan, you’re an economist. I’d love to just get your top-line thought of what surprised you. This is a global study, and you look across multiple industries. Anything that just sort of really jumped out to you as different about now?', 'Susan Lund: Well, one of the things that I thought was really surprising was the extent to which we were able to quantify that the world is a riskier place. I’ll admit, we started this work last fall—fall of 2019—and pandemic was not on our list of supply-chain risks. We were thinking about things like trade tensions and trade disputes, or hurricanes or cyberattacks. And then COVID came out of nowhere. But even before COVID, we were able to talk to experts across industries and find out that, on average, companies now will expect to see a disruption to their production lines of one to two months, which is a very long time, every three-and-a-half to four years.', 'So even though each time there is a disaster, it seems like it’s coming out of the blue, the fact is that the world has more shocks. This reflects the fact that we live in a multipolar economic system, so there are differences in economic systems competing with each other. It reflects rising temperatures around the globe that’s creating more frequent and severe events, like typhoons and hurricanes, heat waves, and flooding. And it also just reflects the fact that we’ve spent 25 years creating these incredibly complicated, complex global supply chains. And they were designed for cost and efficiency, but without really a thought to what could go wrong along the way.', 'Diane Brady: Yeah, the just-in-time sort of very lean supply chains. That struck me in the report—the complexity of the supply chain in certain industries, but also the overlap in suppliers. Were there particular industries that look especially vulnerable?', 'Susan Lund: We looked at, geographically, where different global supply chains sit. And we find, for instance, that mobile phones and communication equipment is the most exposed to a range of shocks. It’s very exposed to trade disputes because these are high-value goods. It’s exposed to some of the geophysical risks because it sits largely in coastal Asia. And it’s also exposed to cybersecurity risks because it is a high-tech value chain with a lot of value at stake and a lot of intellectual property.', 'Diane Brady: Ed, I want to get to the resilience part.', 'Ed Barriball: I was just going to build on that. It’s interesting. There are some industries that are obviously exposed to shocks. And Susan’s describing the industries that are largely located in coastal Asia. But to her point about the fact that pandemics weren’t really high on our list when we started this a year ago, I think it’s a bit of a fool’s errand to try and predict where the next shock is going to come from. Obviously, you should have an idea of what’s out there and what could happen, and a sense of the probabilities. But we also really think companies should be not just focusing on the scary event—the hurricane, the cyberattack, the pandemic, whatever it is—but really focus on their vulnerabilities. What do you control? Where are you single sourced? Where do you not have visibility in your supply chain that you should? And focusing on those. If you try to predict what the next shock is going to be, you’re probably going to be wrong 99 percent of the time. But you can certainly see where your vulnerabilities are.', 'Diane Brady: Where are most of the vulnerabilities? What do you find are some of the most overlooked areas where you can sort of have levers against these acts of God and other things?', 'Ed Barriball: I think it starts from a foundation, really, of actually just even knowing what is out there. So a lot of companies have relied for a long time on the people that they know, they buy from directly, to essentially manage whoever they buy from and manage risks around that.', 'You need to both understand and have a really good idea, based on who you buy from, of the risks that they represent to you and the vulnerabilities that they represent. But then you also really need to work on building the fact base of “if I try to get as good transparency as I can, and then who else I’m buying from, what vulnerabilities do they represent?” So I think there’s been a real shortcoming just in understanding the full scope of vulnerabilities, from who you know you buy from and from who they buy from.', 'You know, I think sometimes people think about, oh, financially fragile suppliers or, oh, the places I’m single sourced, and those are certainly vulnerabilities. But as we’re in the world we’re in today, I think looking at vulnerabilities in areas of data security—in reputation and structural exposure to things like climate change or things like trade tensions is really important.', 'Diane Brady: We’ve seen this push for transparency, Susan, in areas like retail, where consumers, for example, want to know where something is sourced, how much somebody was paid. How important is transparency in your mind as a lever going forward, and is it an area where you think that, you know, there’s some critical decision making taking place?', 'Susan Lund: Well, transparency is incredibly important because it’s an area that companies can make this a win–win. So they can become more resilient by understanding their full network of suppliers, as Ed was saying, and then they can take steps to address it, so they can actually be more efficient and resilient. You pointed out that consumers have been worried about environmental and labor standards, so this has already been a push. But by understanding the deeper tiers of your supply chain, companies are finding that they have critical potential bottlenecks. So there might be a second-tier supplier who’s supplying five of your tier-one suppliers. So if something happens to that one node in the second tier, that could bring down a whole set of inputs.', 'You can go into the third tier of, you know, your supplier’s supplier’s suppliers and find similar things. And so by building visibility, companies can first of all build resilience, but then they also have an opportunity to rethink the network structure and geography of their supply chain.', 'Ed Barriball: Building on that with Susan, I think it’s not even just the transparency into the tiers that you don’t know about—that she was talking about—but with the number of acquisitions and mergers that occur, a lot of times companies might not even have that full picture for the people that they’re now consolidated from. So it’s even at the most fundamental level of getting transparency about what you buy from as an entity and also getting down into those lower tiers.', 'Diane Brady: I want to talk about the reality of the situation that we’re facing, and certainly the pandemic has touched so many industries, and looking ahead to the economic picture, investing in, building in redundancy or creating new control sounds like an expensive exercise. If I’m sitting here as a business leader, the equation that I’m making in my head is what can I afford to invest in this environment? Where is the most strategic use, for the most part, of my limited resources?', 'Ed Barriball: Well, I think the first thing I’d say is that you can’t afford not to invest in this. If you don’t invest in this, you’re going to end up behind over time or as the world continues to change, and you’re exposed to more and more shocks. You’re just going to end up facing, over time, probably losses that aren’t sustainable. And then, yes, I think others are going to. And our big challenge for companies in this situation is how do you get both more resilient and more productive? And I think many companies have the ability, long before you have to start making decisions, to ask “do I invest in something that’s not going to make me more productive today?” There’s a whole list of things that can make you more resilient and more productive. Can you actually have a different category strategy for things that you’re buying? “I’m buying circuit boards. Could I actually buy them in a way that’s more resilient and also result in lower cost because I have a more diverse set of sources to choose from? Could I think about redesigning how I design my products to actually allow me to have more diversity in my sourcing and make it simpler to assemble?”', 'The auto industry went through this, actually, over the past decade or so, since the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which was really a wake-up call for that industry to the risks they faced. They did things like dual sourcing and getting more transparency, but they also focused on ”how do I simplify my products so I’m not introducing a bunch of vulnerability from the complexity of my products?”', 'Diane Brady: So redesigning. That’s interesting.', 'Susan Lund: I think there are two interesting examples of companies in the report. One, back to digitization, was Nike.  Nike has China-based operations. Nike is a company that had invested in really understanding where goods were in its supply chain, through a digital platform linked to its contract manufacturers. And when COVID hit in January, it was able to see what products it had, reroute goods that were headed toward the brick-and-mortar stores that were shut down now, toward ecommerce fulfillment centers.', 'They were able to shift their marketing strategy to focus on marketing the goods that they had in stock, not the ones that they were planning to have but knew now they wouldn’t have. And as a result, sales declined less in the first quarter, compared to other competitors. So that agility is a great example of how this does pay off over time. But I’d also say that one of the things we did in this report was actually try to size how much does it cost companies to have all these disruptions that are increasingly frequent. And what we found on average is that a company could expect, over a decade, to lose two-thirds of their profits in one year when you look over to ten years. It of course varies by industry, and it will vary by company, depending on how much inventory they hold and other elements of their own production system. But we hope that with this analysis, and by doing that calculation, companies will realize that they could invest up to that amount and still come out ahead if they take a multiyear view.', 'Diane Brady: How much are companies looking at this through a political prism, the trade realities. Susan, are they moving to new markets?', 'Susan Lund: Well, trade tensions are a big issue for companies sitting in every geography in the world. And there is definitely a sense that we are in a world in terms of government involvement in trade. And we had lived in a world, and everyone in business today had grown up in an era, where, basically, trade became more and more free as time went on, right? Tariffs went down, not up, and restrictions, nontariff barriers came down, not up. But we’re no longer in that world, for a variety of reasons. So, yes, companies around the world—in the United States but also in Europe and in Asia—are actively thinking about how are they going to cope with the new realities of trade tensions and where that could go.', 'Diane Brady: I was shocked at the percentage of the supply chain that could relocate across borders. I think it was something like one-quarter. What’s the time line for that?', 'Susan Lund: The analysis we did was to try to get our arms around—based on both the economic factors involved in supply chains and the noneconomic factors—how much could reasonably shift over what we call the medium term, say three to five years. And the long term, a decade from now, clearly everything could move. But in the next three to five years—based on the business case for moving or based on the likelihood that governments are declaring your good that you’re producing an essential item or important to national competitiveness or security—that could shift.', 'And we come up with a range of 16 percent to 26 percent of world trade that could take place among different sets of countries. It’s not a forecast saying this will happen, but it at least gives you an idea. First of all, not everything can move. For those who say, you know, reshore everything, that’s not really an option. That won’t happen. But for others who say, well, supply chains are very sticky—nothing’s going to shift—I think our analysis would suggest that’s probably not the right answer either. So it is a big number. It’s $2.9 trillion to $4.6 trillion worth of exports each year that could, over time, shift to different countries.', 'Diane Brady: Ed, a lot of what you do is regarding transformation. I think digitization plus transformation equals automation in many cases. What’s the impact of this on jobs?', 'Ed Barriball: I don’t think there’s a blanket answer for that. I think there are people who have been predicting the demise of the need for human labor and the rise of robots to do all of our work for a long time, probably for decades—the idea that at some point we’ll automate away all work, and humans will just live a life of leisure. And I think we’ve found that the world’s a really complicated place, as this report highlights. And that probably isn’t happening any time soon. So I don’t think that there’s any blanket implication for jobs from this. Will there be shifts, then, for certain types of work, as Susan is talking about? Absolutely. Value chains will move. They have been, and they’ll continue to, and what we say in this report is that there’s potential for significant shift in the medium term.', 'Diane Brady: Well, let me talk about what it means for consumers as somebody who’s bought a $3 roll of toilet paper at one point during this pandemic. Is that my future? Am I going to have to put up with paying more for what I want?', 'Ed Barriball: No. I really don’t think that’s the case. I think that there is a moment in time there where you could have such a discontinuity with coronavirus where there are some commodities and some products that have gotten more expensive. But this is solvable problem. I really, truly believe that through the example like Susan gave with Nike in China—their ability to use digital to not only avoid really disruptive costs from this but also to be able to work with the marketing team and make sure that things are getting out to the market that consumers want and consumers will buy. And they were actually able to really satisfy their customer demands at the time and also avoid a really disruptive stop in their supply chain and in their logistic operations.', 'That to me is the future. And I would look to that and say how can we, as companies across industries, get to that point where we’re driving both better service to customers and also not increasing our costs.', 'Diane Brady: Susan, you spoke a little bit about the regional variations in industry. I’m curious, as you looked across industries, which ones are furthest behind? Are there particular ones that really strike you as most vulnerable, and where would they need to invest?', 'Susan Lund: One thing that we’d say is there’s certainly no industry that’s uniformly out ahead on this. There are companies within each industry that are leaders and have set up risk-management systems in their supply-chain operations, that have used big data analytics to forecast demand, who scan the horizon and see shocks coming and respond. But there’s no industry that’s done a great job. In fact, a survey that we did in May of global supply-chain heads found that only in one industry—aerospace and defense—25 percent of companies thought that they had already fully digitized their supply-chain operations. And all the other industries were lower than that. So every industry just has massive opportunity to get out ahead of this.', 'Diane Brady: Ed, what do you see companies actually doing? Where are we likely to see a surge  of activity?', 'Ed Barriball: I think there’s a few things. One is I do think there’s a real push right now around this transparency question, and how do I get better transparency, both in the who I’m buying from and who folks that I buy from are buying from. And there’s some really interesting innovations. I was reading about a company that is starting to use a mix of satellite data and cell-phone data to track where their raw material is coming from. They source a lot of material from forests in Southeast Asia, and they’re very worried about making sure material is coming from farmers who are not practicing nonsustainable farming practices and a lot of slash-and-burn farming.', 'And so they’re actually using satellite data and mobile phone-data to actively monitor that. This whole idea of “how do I use all of the new sources of data that are available to me over the past five, ten years, combined with processing power that I now have to get more transparency and to get better monitoring of our supply chain?”—that’s one big push. I think there’s going to be another real push around “how do I rethink how I’m running my organization to make sure I’m incentivizing the organization to build resilience as well as grow the enterprise and control our costs?”', 'It’s very typical for executives to have their performance-review metrics around revenue growth, market-share gain, productivity gain, cost cutting, et cetera. How do you add in there metrics about resilience? And how do you hold executives accountable for actually building resilience? How do I answer the question “am I more resilient now than I was a year ago or two years ago?”', 'Diane Brady: The supply chain almost sounds like it has to be taken out of the silo of the supply-chain officer and embedded more in the general organization.', 'Ed Barriball: Absolutely. I think it really now needs to be a CEO-level issue. One of the statistics that we have in the report is that 80 percent of global trade now flows through countries with declining political-stability scores. That’s not a siloed issue for companies to deal with. That is an issue that you need to think, in a cross-functional way, about what does this mean for us as a company. What does this mean for our value chain, as Susan articulated at the beginning—you know, the full chain from raw material to the end customer—and how do we need to respond to that.', 'Susan Lund: I think that a big shift we’re seeing in companies around the world is they are reevaluating the geography of their supply chains. First of all, you know, different costs of energy, of labor, of transportation have changed, so part of it is just a recalculation of very specific components. I’ve set a supply chain in a certain way; it may span the entire globe, but is that still the most efficient, given that we now have changes in wage rates around the world, and we have, you know, low-cost energy in some places but not others.', 'And now they’re going to embed resilience as well. One of the trends we saw happening even before COVID—and at the McKinsey Global Institute I’d written about in a report 18 months ago—was the regionalization of trade, how for the first time in 20 years, trade among neighboring countries was growing faster than trade between countries in different regions. So trade within Asia, within Europe, and within North America was growing faster than trade across those regions.', 'And that’s really interesting. And it was happening for several reasons not having to do with risk at the time. We thought, well, there is a premium on speed to market for any good that you sell to customers. It’s better to be able to capture shifts in demand. So in the fashion world and textiles and apparel, if an influencer like Meghan Markle or Kim Kardashian West wears a certain dress or uses a handbag, it flies off the shelves. So you need to be able to  react quickly. So having suppliers closer and  taking less time to get to your end-consumer markets was important.', 'There was also a premium put on being able to collaborate more closely with suppliers, and it’s just easier if they’re not halfway around the world. But now, on top of that, we’ve got the element of COVID and the realization that there is resilience. So one of the things Toyota did after the 2011 Fukushima disaster was it found that it was producing parts in Japan that were distributed to its plants around the world, and so production went down worldwide. After that experience, they moved to diversify their supply chains in North American, in Europe, and in Asia, so that a shock in one part of the world wouldn’t have this ripple effect. And a few years later, when the 2016 earthquake hit, they were in a very different position and saw much less downtime.', 'Diane Brady: We’ve talked about stress tests in the report. One thing that’s interesting is where the pressure regarding these value chains is going to come from. We’ve talked about bikes, we’ve talked about toilet paper, but there’s also food and, you know, personal protective equipment. These can be life or death issues. Give us some sense as to the environment around this and how critical an issue this is at the country and the consumer level as well.', 'Ed Barriball: Right now, it’s on the agenda of every C-suite that I speak with and that I hear colleagues of mine speaking with. Right now, it is truly a top-of-mind issue. I think what will really force change in this area over time is customers are going to start asking questions about “tell me about how resilient you are.” And it might not always be the customer in the grocery store but, certainly, the grocery stores themselves. And if you think across all sectors, companies are going to now start asking their suppliers to help them understand how they plan for resiliency, how they are resilient.', 'So I think pressure will come from the customer. I think pressure will come from investors. Investors will realize that even if returns look great today, if the supply chain was designed in the way that they’ve been designed over the past couple of decades—and there’s fragility there—those returns aren’t going to be stable over the long run. And so I think customers and investors will force this change.', 'Susan Lund: I would agree. I would add that I think that governments may play a role as well, that COVID has illustrated vulnerabilities in getting essential goods like medical equipment and supplies and pharmaceuticals in a hurry when they’re needed in great quantities. And lots of countries around the world are thinking “how can we better understand those potential vulnerabilities and minimize them in the future?”', 'Diane Brady: Thank you to Susan Lund, who’s in the McKinsey Global Institute, and Ed Barriball, in the Supply Chain and Manufacturing Practice.

Here’s how organizations can use agile practices to transform their organizations.,"['Agile operating models are characterized by rapid learning and decision-making cycles. Here’s how organizations can use agile practices to transform their organizations.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Sherina Ebrahim and Shail Thaker on how companies can use agile practices to transform their organizations. An edited version of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, agility was a hot topic. Some companies came into the crisis with agile practices, and let’s just say that others have had agility thrust upon them. But what does it really mean to be agile, and how can companies use those practices to transform their organization? Simon London finds out, speaking with senior partners Sherina Ebrahim, who works in New Jersey, and Shail Thaker, who’s based in London. Here’s Simon.', 'Simon London: Sherina and Shail, thanks for being here. Welcome to the podcast.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Thank you.', 'Shail Thaker: Thank you.', 'Simon London: So let’s just define our terms because this is a hot topic. This is a topic one reads about quite a lot. But Shail, why don’t you take a first whack at this. How would you define agile?', 'Shail Thaker: That’s a very good question to start with. So agile started life as a set of working practices in software development that were really focused on ensuring that product development was done in a customer-focused way—so end-user centric, heavily iterative. All of those things that a lot of people associated with agile at a working-practice level. And we’re in a very exciting time now where those working practices are being scaled up. Not just scaled up in IT, but actually scaled up across entire organizations.', 'And we are ending up with organizational constructs that look and feel quite different to what a lot of us grew up with over the past 30 years. We’re in a sort of tipping point now, where a lot of companies, a lot of entities, are looking at themselves and saying, “Well, is there an opportunity for us to organize in a different way? How do we organize in a different way to get a different outcome, particularly to increase external focus, adaptability, speed, raw cycle time?”', 'Agile is, at its core, in its simplest, a set of almost team-based working practices. If you ask me, “What is agility at an enterprise level?” I’d say it’s the scale-up of that in a meaningful way across entire organizations.', 'Simon London: So maybe, Sherina, just double-click on that. When we’re talking about at an organizational level, what are some of the things that you’re going to see on the ground that would define an enterprise or an organization which is becoming agile in that sense?', 'Sherina Ebrahim: I think the one thing that also is really important to think about when we think about agile organizations is to remember that it’s not only about what we would typically think about as organization structure.', 'To really become agile, it’s very much around mindsets and behaviors and really adopting a very different way of working. And so, I was just actually having a conversation yesterday with someone who said, “Well, we have cross-functional teams. It sounds basically the same as what agile is.” And it’s not. If you have a truly agile organization, you have groups of people who are singularly focused on what we would call a mission or a value driver or task, however you want to define it.', 'And the right groups of people are brought together to accomplish that. So if it’s about coming together to launch a new product, the people from insights and R&D and marketing and supply chain will all come together into a squad or a team. And their job is to say, “Instead of launching a new product in three years, how do we do it in six months?” How that’s enabled is not just to say, “We came together,” and then gave them a task. It is giving them the room to make decisions quickly. It is giving them the autonomy to pull in the right people when they need them, so that they can get the right insights at the right time. And they can actually make choices to move faster than what our traditional, hierarchical, matrixed organizations will allow them to do.', 'If you’re on a team, you feel quite empowered. You feel like you have an end goal. Everyone on the team, no matter what part of the organization you come from, is incented on that end goal—not what my function or chapter expects of me.', 'If you’re on a team, you feel quite empowered. You feel like you have an end goal. Everyone on the team, no matter what part of the organization you come from, is incented on that end goal—not what my function or chapter expects of me, but we’re all driving against the same goal in the same time.', 'Simon London: Right. Now then, I think an interesting question is, how many organizations are really trying to go big on this? Because I think, as you say, there are a lot of organizations that say, “Well, we have cross-functional teams.” Or there are certain parts of the organization—typically, software development to begin with, but other things as well—that are trying to work in an agile way. How many organizations would you say are really going big and trying to do this at enterprise scale?', 'Shail Thaker: I think we have to be a little cautious around what we define as going big because the end blueprint of what one company may look like in its fully agile state could look and feel quite different to another, right? And that depends highly on industry contacts, the specific portfolio you have, a whole bunch of things—not least the legacy and sort of historic baggage that a lot of organizations have.', 'Now, if you asked me how many have an ambition to do this at scale, we’ve done recent survey work across a broad spectrum of companies, across industries, that says 70 percent of companies in some shape or form are piloting agile now.', 'It is a big difference from running agile pilots to actually feeling comfortable that version one of whatever your agile operating model is, is in place. And with that, it’s not “I’ve done my architecture; now I can sit back and breathe,” but it is having an ambition to say, “I’m not just doing it in IT. I’m not just doing it in these shiny, new digital areas. I’m not just doing it in these particular business units.”', 'Almost use system thinking to say, “I can have individual teams that work in very much the way that Sherina described earlier. But actually, I need a backbone that supports them. I need an HR system that enables people to move around. I need a finance system and a budgeting system that allow me to resource reallocate. I need to have career paths defined for people.” So I think there are a lot of companies—I would argue even to say most companies—that are experimenting.', 'And then I think there are a handful of companies around the world who have done it at enterprise scale successfully.', 'And interestingly, those aren’t the biggest companies. Actually, the ability of some small and midsize companies to move very quickly on this agenda, where this is actually quite existential for them—you do this or you die—or indeed, they have the ability to mobilize the entire organization against this mission: those are where we see some really, really interesting case studies.', 'But the things that come out of them are that you are getting happier customers, you’re getting a productivity uplift, and you’re getting happier employees with improved engagement. So it’s a long way of saying, “How many companies are trying? An awful lot are trying.”', 'Simon London: It’s a journey.', 'Shail Thaker: Absolutely.', 'Simon London: But there are an awful lot—maybe, like we said, 70 percent based on survey work—that are either on that journey or have an ambition to go on that journey.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: And I think there are maybe two other things to consider. The ones that we see moving faster along that journey are the ones who, in many cases, have to. It’s a do-it-or-die kind of thing.', 'And that’s maybe a little bit alarmist. And we see that, for example, in the financial-services industry and places where the external environment is changing so fast, such as digitization—how consumers are using technology and interacting with that industry. So you actually have to change in a way that is faster to respond to what’s going on—meeting the needs of consumers. There’s another slew of industries, whether it’s consumer or healthcare, coming right behind as well. So I think that’s one reason that accelerates people through the journey.', 'The other, I would say, is leadership. There are definitely companies that are not quite on the cusp of “we really must change.” But the CEO or a business-unit leader has recognized the power of what this could be and has started to take the organization on a journey, albeit maybe slowly, trying to really build the muscle in order to get there first.', 'Simon London: What are some companies that come to mind that are a fair way along on the journey?', 'Shail Thaker: I mean, there are some fairly talismanic examples that are high profile. So I would argue, in the banking sector, you could pick many banks. But the most publicly known is obviously ING. If you look in the telecom sector, Spark in New Zealand is a great example of leadership-led transformation.', 'And you could argue that, in the pharmaceutical world, Roche has been taking a real leadership stance but with a very different angle around creating agile leaders and what that means. And the list goes on. I would say those are still companies that are on a journey.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Just to add in other industries, I think we are seeing it with Walmart, which is in a very different industry that is starting to see benefits of using that methodology.', 'Simon London: And then there are companies that were sort of born agile, like Spotify, which is one of those sorts of talismanic examples of a company that’s just done this almost since the very beginning.', 'Shail Thaker: Absolutely. And that’s where, when I refer to the historic baggage of companies, if you’re talking about a 100-person start-up, these working practices, particularly if it’s a tech-enabled company ...', 'Simon London: ... it’s probably how you work.', 'If you’re talking about a 60,000-, 70,000-person organization that is across 80 countries and has been operating in a matrix with very well-established norms, then [becoming agile is] more of a journey.', 'Shail Thaker: It’s absolutely the most efficient and effective way of working in small groups. If you’re talking about a 60,000-, 70,000-person organization that is across 80 countries and has been operating in a matrix with very well-established norms, then that’s more of a journey.', 'But I would argue, that is also where a ton of value-creation potential is, because those are the companies that were built based on a simple premise: the matrix is a great structure for leveraging skill—and frankly, being the 800-pound gorilla and stomping on your competitors.', 'Alright, that is a wonderful construct for that. It is not a great construct if you have to move at speed. And that’s where, as I think Sherina referred to—whether it is external regulatory pressures, whether it is shifting consumer behavior, whether it is challenge of incumbents by disruptors—this imperative around speed comes in.', 'Simon London: There’s urgency?', 'Shail Thaker: There’s real urgency, yeah.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: And what’s interesting about it is, if you think about a spectrum of “born digital,” typically, they start small and can do everything that Shail just described. And on the other end of the spectrum, we have very large global companies—highly matrixed, functional.', 'What’s interesting is that the challenge is sort of just an area of gray. So we have already talked about how a large organization just starts to think about changing, really think about moving to an agile organization, with the right backbone.', 'What you see as start-ups scale themselves is that they start to run into the same questions, because you can’t just keep running like that as you get bigger. So they, too, then have to ask, “Well, what’s the backbone that I need to put in place in order to continue to work in this way?”', 'If you think of agile as an outcome of a particular setup where you’re putting the Lego bricks around which bits are dynamic and which bits need to be stable ... start-ups have a ton of dynamic, not a whole lot of stable. Incumbents: huge amounts of stable, not a lot of dynamic.', 'Shail Thaker: But also, if you think of agile as an outcome of a particular setup where you’re putting the Lego bricks right around which bits are dynamic and which bits need to be stable for me to be able to deliver speed and be nimble and all that good stuff, start-ups have a ton of dynamic, not a whole lot of stable. Incumbents: huge amounts of stable, not a lot of dynamic.', 'So it’s the different ends of the spectrum, but as Sherina says, the convergent, the equilibrium point, for these—there’s a lot of cross-learning to be had.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Yeah. And I think the other thing I would add is that, oftentimes, one misconception is that agile is just to “do what you want.” And it’s not, actually. It’s systematized. It’s a pretty structured way in which to work.', 'And so, this notion of what should be stable and what should be dynamic is really an important distinction that people should think through, because the stable enables people to come to work. They know the framework that they’re working in. They know their role and what might be their career path. And they know where their home is, if you will. And the dynamic is actually ways of working in which you can bring different people together so that they can quickly get something done and then move on to the next one.\', ""And a pretty important success factor, I would argue, is the notion of dynamic resource allocation, which larger, more stable companies are not used to. They\'re used to yearlong planning cycles, budget cycles, but to be much more agile, you have to think about quarterly."", \'And so, it sounds easy when you say, “dynamic resource allocation.” There are reams of proof that it actually is a value-creating driver. But it’s a very hard thing to change—especially if—you’re not used to it at all.', 'Shail Thaker: I think, to dig into the point around dynamic resource allocation as an example of the types of things that are different, there’s absolutely a hardwiring piece. Finance organizations are not built to move money around. We don’t have the management information systems that allow us to track.', 'We don’t have the forums and meeting cadence and business calendar that free up enough time to make real trade-offs. We haven’t trained leaders to have the right discussions around this. But sitting above all of this is also a massive change in management mindset.', 'We have an entire cadre of leaders. I will paint this in black and white, just to point out the extremes: “I have been successful as a leader because I was given my budget, and I delivered or overdelivered on my budget.” That is very different from an enterprise-leadership mindset, which is essentially, “We’re all in service of a mission.”', 'To do that, I accept that, if things change, the budget I thought I had, the financial and human capital, can and should be reallocated. And that is a massive shift from “my number and budget commitment is my bond as a leader, and that is my commitment to the enterprise too.” I am now a participating leader in service of a mission.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Another difference is very much how you think about incentives.', 'Shail Thaker: Absolutely.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: So in Shail’s story, for example: if you’re incented on making your budget, that’s what you’re going to do. Whereas if you think about an organization that’s agile, you’re not incented on your function. You’re not incented on your box. You’re incented on the purpose, the mission, which is very clearly tied to the value creation of the company. That changes the entire mindset and behaviors of the people. Again, easy to say. Not very easy to flip the switch when you’ve grown up in an organization.', 'Simon London: So let me just pick up on a term you used earlier, Shail. You talked about a blueprint. That implies to me an overall mapping of the different elements of this end state that you want to get to. Just double-click on that for us. What are the elements in the blueprint?', 'Shail Thaker: I think the blueprint is quite a key step in a company’s journey. It’s not always the first step, but it is a key step. Companies can start by piloting. But without a 60 percent, 70 percent view of how all the building blocks come together in the enterprise level, it’s quite hard.', 'And that’s why we think a blueprint is important. Now, what is in a blueprint? You don’t do agile for the sake of it. Your agenda around applying agile working practices is strongly linked to the ability to create value.', 'And that refers to which parts of your business system actually could create more value by being faster or more adaptable and, indeed, which ones could create more value by having more dynamic resource reallocation. So it’s almost through this value-creation lens that you look at your business.', 'Simon London: So that’s the first step?', 'Shail Thaker: And you identify nodes. So there are bits of your business for which agile working practices are massively relevant and create a huge opportunity. There are, frankly, other bits which don’t matter so much, and agile’s not going to transform them, because they are actually steady, consistent. Now, they play an important role in the system. But the blueprint first identifies these nodes of value. Where is agile going to make a difference?', 'Sherina Ebrahim: People will say, “We want to become agile.” And so, I think, you have to ask, “To what end and where?”', 'Shail Thaker: Absolutely.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: And if you are not clear on that—and again, it seems very simple, but people are not clear—it really isn’t a critical underpinning of success as a starting point.\', ""Shail Thaker: Yeah, absolutely. So let’s take step one of the blueprint as understanding where value is created by the application of agile working practices. The second piece is, “If I have those, I have a set of options of almost dynamic Lego bricks”—that\'s a visual I use."", \'And you may think that agile working practices equal a cross-functional team. The reality is, that’s not at all true. There are plenty of working models that contribute to agility—by the way, going all the way back to lean working practices and some quite old-fashioned but very relevant concepts.', 'There are quite a few more Lego bricks than you might think. The step two of the blueprint is, you apply these dynamic models and choose the right model for the right node of value to create the most value, right?', 'And once you’ve got that right, it’s great. You have almost a patchwork. Then you have to think, “What’s the minimum backbone I need to put in place to actually get the system working?” And it’s important to think of the backbone in this blueprint as something other than the organizational units you currently have. Often, it could be shared vision, common career path—think job descriptions.', 'It’s actually thinking expansively about the backbone in the system that holds the system together. As an enterprise leader, you can take a step back and say, “Am I comfortable that this is all building to an end point that makes sense?”', 'Simon London: So three steps I’m hearing. Number one, really figure out and agree as a leadership team where value is created to your application of more agile working practices—where could it be transformative?', 'Number two, what are the working practices we’re going to apply, where? And to your point, it’s not always just one thing. It’s not like everything’s going to work on a scrum basis.', 'And then third, what are the more stable elements? What is the backbone? What are the enablers that we’re going to need to allow us to scale this? Is that right, broadly?', 'Sherina Ebrahim: And the one thing I think is implicit in your number one, when you said the leadership team really has to be clear on the vision, the implicit value is that the leadership team really understands what they’re about to embark on. And so, what kind of scale or vision of transformation are they thinking of?', 'That doesn’t mean they have to know today that we want to become 70 percent agile or whatever it is. But they do need to have a sense of, “What are we trying to accomplish if we go down this journey?” Because just doing one or two pilots here or there, that might get you something.', 'But if you have a bigger vision, if you’re trying to turn the company or a part of the company in a different way, being clear on what that is and how they will have to lead in a different way is actually a very important thing for them be very aligned around.', 'Shail Thaker: I mean, we look at the success factors, and it’s also the failure modes. And one of the biggest is actually ambivalent leadership commitment. It’s really easy to sit back and say, “Look, I’ve got a whole bunch of pilots going on. We’ll sit back and see how they turn out.”', 'The reality is, after a while, you can create a huge amount of value in a localized agile pilot. But to some extent, it’s like entropy. You’re shifting the complexity to a new set of interfaces. And you rely on the energy and enthusiasm of the people to sustain that pilot.', 'That is not indefinite. So pilots can run out of steam, and organizations can lose their window, because agile becomes a dirty word or a failed-pilot word in the organization. And it’s not about learning; it’s actually just that thing we tried a few years ago. So you can’t pilot your way to scale. At some point, leadership has to commit. At some point, there will be—particularly when it comes to the backbone—a switching of how the organization is wired, and that takes commitment.', 'Simon London: So at some point, you’ve got to make a leap of faith? I mean, not without evidence.', 'Shail Thaker: Yeah, well, I would say it’s not so much a leap of faith as an understanding of what the consequences of this are going to be for the organization and you as a company.', 'Simon London: And the consequences are profound, if you’re going to do it at scale? That’s the point.', 'Shail Thaker: We believe that they are. Yeah.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Absolutely.', 'Shail Thaker: It’s a transformation, and it is very, very different from how organizations operate today. But that is not to say that the people who are operating our organizations today are irrelevant to the future organization. It’s just that you have to be signed up for the journey.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Yeah. I think that’s a really important point, Shail, because I fundamentally believe—and obviously, I’m biased—that whether it’s five years down, X years down, every organization is going to have to embody some components of agile.', 'The external world, the consumer environment, is just moving in a way that means we have to change. And so how do you actually move from what are fairly monolithic organizations today—everyone has their role, everyone has their function, et cetera—to one where everybody really embraces that it’s actually quite different and dynamic and it will continue to change? That is the point. So how many of our clients, our companies, today go through reorganization number one? And then before that one’s just finished, you’re on to reorganization number two.', 'Because you’re trying to get it right in terms of what you need to respond. And if you actually get it right from an agile perspective, you will never have to do a reorganization, because that is the fabric of how you work. You should be able to shift and change. And maybe today you work in a stable part of the business, and tomorrow you’ll be on an agile team. If you can just sort of paint that picture, it’s quite different from what it is today.', 'And therefore, to your point, it’s quite a shift. But at the same time, as you’re on that journey, it’s really important to make sure that people come along, understanding where they are and their place in the organization as well.', 'Shail Thaker: And to build off that, as we go back to the mindsets and why is this sometimes difficult, there is a perception—and I’ll use the word “perception”—of risk around this, because it feels like moving from classical command-and-control systems to much more decentralized systems. Now, the reality of the risk versus fully accounting for the cost of doing nothing has to take into account that this isn’t throwing all the pieces in the air. It’s actually quite a regimented but different way of working. So there’s that piece around risk that is quite important: around getting this sort of mindset shift.', 'And the second is, you’re talking about redefining how people value themselves and value impact in businesses. So I am in a system where, if I do well at my job, I’ll also get a pay raise, but I’ll get a new title. And with that new title comes more people. And I manage bigger and bigger things.', 'One of the outcomes of more fluid resource reallocation and really focusing almost the body mass of the organization around the biggest priorities is that you don’t have as large of a management layer in between. And that delayering is quite disorientating for people who say, “But hang on, if I’m great at my job, there are all of these roles that I could’ve got into.” So this links to some of the things like incentives or career pathing. How do you reward, recognize, and give people progression in a world that is fundamentally more dynamic? So these are all the types of challenges.', 'Simon London: This underlines for me a couple things. Number one, why it’s transformation if you’re going to do it at scale, because it has to touch all of these: systems, mindsets, processes—I mean everything. And the other thing is, what you’re talking about there again is backbone in a way, isn’t it? Thinking about rewards, career progressions, different roles, and having fundamentally different ways of being recognized for impact compared to a traditional organization.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Absolutely. I think it’s to make it really real. For many current employees, it’s very much tied up in how they value their own self-worth, right? My title, my number of people. And so, as you say, I think the backbone parts are all of those things.', 'And what’s interesting is, the younger employees of today actually prefer to work in a much more fluid, more information-based environment. That’s how they grew up, right? And so that’s also going to play into this as organizations grow.', 'I think what we haven’t touched on enough, as you think about the backbone, is processes. So this implies that quite a few processes actually have to change, right? One we already touched on was how do you think about budgeting—resource reallocation, right? That needs to be reengineered.', 'Simon London: Yes, because if you’ve got a plodding budgeting process, you’re not going to be able to allocate capital in an agile way.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Technology infrastructure underneath it to help you do it dynamically, right? That’s one of the barriers today: the system doesn’t allow you to be that fast. So budgeting is one of them. You’ve already talked about career pathing and career planning. To some, it’s blasphemous to not necessarily know in three or five years where I should be going. And people have to get comfortable with some of those things—again, not in all parts, but in how to live in a world that has some of these other things. So I think some are going through transformation, and some processes will stay the same.', 'Shail Thaker: Car-rental policies.', 'Simon London: Yeah, right. Just as an example.', 'Shail Thaker: Yeah, company carpools. There’s going to be a whole bunch of background stuff that speed and adaptability will not impact in any shape or form.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Right. Not everything will change. There are some that will need to, and many others will stay the same.', 'Shail Thaker: There is an important clarification. It is absolutely true that the younger generation of workers adapt to this. They’ve sort of grown up in this environment and  are adapting to it a lot more quickly, and it’s natural to them.', 'That is not to say that, irrespective of age, engagement doesn’t go up. So when we look at what the data shows, it’s not that the younger workers are really happy working this way, and the older workers find it terrible. It’s that teams, irrespective of age, see massive increases of engagement. I’m talking about 20 points, 20 percentage points plus, right? So people enjoy working in this as long as the rest of the system allows them to do it and does not massively penalize them or make their life considerably complicated.', 'Simon London: I was going to ask a devil’s advocate question, actually. I mean, the younger generation adapts to this easily—big generalization, but a lot of younger people, particularly having come into the workforce in the last ten years, have been forced to do gig work, and gig work is almost a form of agile outside any organization. Are we talking here in some way about bringing gig work inside?', 'Shail Thaker: The gig economy has come up now. I would say “forced” is a very strong word. So that sense of compulsion  when we talk about the gig economy is always dangerous territory to get into.', 'But absolutely. The facts are that there is an element of flexibility and an element of uncertainty on what you’re going to be doing on a day-to-day basis. What I would say is, there isn’t one element of the gig economy, which is uncertainty of income. And actually, that sort of uncertainty stretches so far.', 'But you still have the security of being part of a mission, right? And this again becomes part of the stable backbone. There are elements of purpose, elements of mission, and elements of security that sit around this way of working that actually allow people to step away from a lot of the insecurities of the day-to-day work in a big company that are negative. It frees up a lot of the positive energy, which is where we see the uplift.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: I completely agree. I think it’s very important to reinforce this notion of security, for lack of a better word. It’s not necessarily job security as we know it today. But we do know the fundamental fabric of the company that you’re working for and what they’re trying to do, how they’re trying to do it—whether it’s processes, how you’re treated, the ways of working.', 'And so, yeah, I may not know exactly today that tomorrow I’m going to be in a different mission. But I know that’s how I work. And that baseline of security, which all people want, is one that’s an important thing not to miss. Otherwise, it feels like it’s a bit of a free-for-all, and it’s not.', 'Shail Thaker: I’ll play devil’s advocate back to you, which is to say that, ultimately, the reason we see the engagement scores go up in the way they do is a greater sense of fulfillment: a greater sense that an individual worker’s time is spent on things that are more value adding, plus a greater connection to a mission that feels more relevant.', 'Those are things that far outweigh almost the comfort blanket of the old way of doing things, with “I know exactly where I fit into the big system.” So the devil’s advocate back would be, yes, there are elements of the gig economy. But the engagement scores of the outcome show that one of those factors significantly outweighs the other.', 'Simon London: So I think a takeaway for me out of this conversation is that I assumed that to do agile, you had to be sort of doing squads, scrums, chapters, guilds—the bunch of core processes that you just have to do if you’re going to claim to be doing agile. It sounds like, actually, as this is scaling across different industries and different sectors and different companies, it’s more heterogeneous than that.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Absolutely. It’s definitely more heterogeneous than that. And I think the way to think about it may be to walk away from all the terminology and the vernacular. There are just core concepts in different ways of working, as we’ve talked about.', 'There’s, whether we call them tribes or squads, the right people coming together to accomplish a mission. There’s what we would call self-managing teams, who sort of run themselves. There’s flow-to-work models.', 'There are a number of different models. And even when you do things that have a construct, which many call tribes, squads, or chapters—frankly, people are starting to use the terminology that works for them—I would try not to get caught up in the language but to ask, “What are the principles around ways of working that really help unlock the value?”', 'Shail Thaker: There are two things that have been particularly important, I think, when I’ve worked with companies on this. One is really defining for your company how the Lego bricks come together. And that’s which of the Lego bricks are most relevant, because you don’t want to create a whole bunch of additional complexity by doing things in a different way, in a different part of the organization to achieve the same end. And then the second piece is how you solve for an individual team, but that blueprint piece is really, really important.', 'Simon London: Let’s discuss how you begin. Let’s say, as a management team, after doing an offsite, you’re beginning to think, “We’ve got to go for this.” How do you start?', 'Sherina Ebrahim: I think there are a couple things, at least, if you’re that management team. When you say, “We’ve got to start,” I would ask that first question on our blueprint, “Agile to what end? Where is the value creation? What are we trying to get to? And over what period of time?”', 'And in that decision, I would actually make sure you, as a team, really understand what it  looks like for both the management team and the mindsets and behaviors, how you have to lead, and what that might imply from an organization perspective.', 'I think once you get your mind wrapped around that—and it doesn’t have to be perfect, but you need to get at least in the right zip code, if you will—then you can take one or two or three of those value-creating levers and say, “What might we actually start to pilot or try within the organization?”', 'But then really know that it is a bit of a proof of concept. It’s not a pilot in the sense of “we want to try it and let it go.” It’s, “How do we want to prove some of these things to build conviction for ourselves and the organization?” And then know that, at some point, you’ll want to, as Shail said before, think about how to flip the switch and start to scale.', 'Shail Thaker: The one thing I would add is there is no substitute to going and actually seeing a company that’s done it. Like, because we can talk about this. You can see it on a page; you can do a workplace.', 'Until you actually see the deployment of this at any form of scale, go and talk to leaders who have done this before and what their journey has been like. That needs to be pretty high on the list of to-dos for the leadership team you described, because it’s great that they all held hands and said, “We’ve got to do this.” But unless they really know what “this” is or what it could be, it’s meaningless.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Yeah, it’s actually step one before you have that conversation. To have a sense of what you’re starting to embark on, go see.', 'Simon London: This sounds negative, but the failure-modes question is often very revealing. So what are a couple of failure modes that you see?', 'Shail Thaker: One, I would say, is one we talked about a lot: leadership conviction. And if that leadership conviction isn’t there or you allow the proliferation of pilots but don’t have the convictions of leadership ...', 'Simon London: ... you’re never really going to flip the switch.', 'Shail Thaker: Do not pass go; do not collect $200. It won’t go anywhere.', 'The second piece is the blueprint. You let leaders who have the conviction do things in their own way. If you don’t define enough guardrails around what the way will be—the right, scalable way—then you won’t get any practices scaling up sufficiently to warrant the backbone change.', 'The third one is, you hope to pilot your way to scale. And actually, as a result, you don’t design the backbone.', 'The fourth one is capability building. We have talked a lot about this being a massive shift in capabilities, at an individual level but also at an institutional level—both the rewiring of processes and also giving people the skills to thrive in this new way. This is, for most organizations, going to be an unprecedented way of working, an unprecedented capability-building challenge, because you’re talking about a large number of people needing to learn how to do things.', 'Simon London: Yes, and the agile coach has become a role in its own right, right?', 'Shail Thaker: Absolutely.', 'Simon London: At a lot of organizations, in the same way that it used to be the Six Sigma Black Belt world, now you’ve got to have agile coaches.', 'Shail Thaker: And then the final one I think I would add is actually, look, this is a transformation. And that means some of the classical transformation tool kit is very relevant. But also, some of it isn’t. So thinking that in the classical organizational design, where I’m going to lock myself up with a small program of people in a room I’m going to design and architect, I’m then going to execute for a period, and bang, we’re going to have day one and hit a new structure. Really understand it’s a transformation, and take the right elements of the transformation tool kit that are relevant for what you’re trying to do.', 'Simon London: Anything you’d add, Sherina?', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Doing the hard work to change the underlying culture, mindsets, and behaviors is a pretty big failure mode. Not doing enough of it. There is such a thing as not quite failing but not quite achieving the promise of agile. And what I mean by that is, I think we’re seeing more and more people recognize a need to do it.', 'But sort of reading the book, hiring maybe one agile coach or something says, “We’re going to change the labels. We’re going to make some teams. And we’re going to check the box for agile.” No way. Right? Really, you can’t just surface-level get there. You have to do the deeper work.', 'Shail Thaker: They are doing performative agile, not really doing agile.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: I encounter a number of people who say, “Oh, we’re agile,” and then you ask the leadership team, “OK, you say you’re agile; what does that mean?” Ten people around the table will give you ten different definitions. “It means we have open space. It means we have three teams.” That’s something I would guard against. If you’re going to do it, really do the deep work. And it’s not a little bit of work to do.', 'Simon London: Awesome. Well, we are out of time; I should let you go. Thank you. That was great fun.', 'Shail Thaker: Thank you very much.', 'Sherina Ebrahim: Thank you very much.', 'Sherina Ebrahim is a senior partner in McKinsey’s New Jersey office, and Shail Thaker is a senior partner in the London office.

An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hi, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast; I’m Diane Brady. Here in the US and in much of the Northern Hemisphere, it’s time to go back to school. This year, there’s the added anxiety of how kids will go back to school. With COVID-19 still spreading, how do we keep people safe and keep students learning? What impact could this have on students and on education itself? Joining me is Jimmy Sarakatsannis, a leader in McKinsey’s North American edcuation group in Washington, DC, who also leads the firm’s K–12 work internationally. Jimmy, welcome.', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: Thanks, Diane. It’s a pleasure to be here.', 'Diane Brady: Let’s get some sense of the landscape. What did we learn from the shutdowns last spring?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: One thing we learned is, very few schools and school systems were ready for remote schooling. There was a big scramble in pretty much every home and in every school and school system to figure out how to keep students learning when they can’t go into schools.', 'A lot was tried. Thankfully, many school systems did try remote schooling. Some of them found it too difficult to even get items such as paper-and-pencil-based resources and any sort of connection to their students. But many were trying daily, doing check-ins with their students virtually at multiple points throughout the day through videoconferencing, apps, and other tools.', 'Some countries with even less access than much of the US were creating TV and radio stations that students could tune into to get at least some instruction. Largely, though, we learned that the scramble in the spring wasn’t good enough. And despite many of our best efforts, we need to do better if we’re going to continue remote and virtual instruction in the coming school year.', 'Diane Brady: I’m the parent of a high schooler, and I have visions of him lying on his bed, saying he was logged into classes, and it not going well. And I start to think about kids who don’t even have access to computers. Tell us about the learning gaps and what happened there.', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: We’re still trying to figure out exactly what level of learning did happen in the spring. Our hope is that over the next couple of months, as students go back to some version of school, we can assess what students actually do know, where they actually are, and compare that to where they were in other years.', 'But we do know that there is a wide variation in access among students. We know that in the US, for example, there were big gaps in access to devices and connectivity among lower-income students, among black students, among Hispanic students. We saw this in log-in data and from self-reported information on simple access.', 'We estimate that if disruption to access continues until January, students in the US will lose about seven months of learning. But that loss won’t be equal: given that level of disruption, we expect white students will lose about six months of learning, Hispanic students about nine months, and Black students up to ten months of learning.', 'Diane Brady: It’s almost as if remote learning is worse for students than if they had not been to school at all, in some cases. Could you give me some sense of what it is that has caused students to suffer so much?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: It’s not clear that remote learning was worse than not being in school at all. But it’s definitely the case that low-quality remote learning, or students struggling to even log in or have any access or interaction with their teachers, is at least as bad as what we’ve seen in past years for students losing ground over the summer, for example.', 'And some of the challenges come from what we would expect. First and foremost, as we’ve said, the ability to have a device and strong enough internet connection to actually log in if there is a session with a teacher or a discussion is important.', 'We’ve all learned as parents and as adults trying to work remotely through this time that it’s not always easy. It’s not always easy to find a quiet, calm place, and students are no exception. We also know that students in challenging circumstances have a harder time finding a calm setting to be able to do that.', 'And finally, imagine a second grader, a third grader, a kindergartner trying to engage pretty much on their own for an entire day. Those students who have a parent or a guardian or some other family member who can support them throughout the day are going to have a much easier time of learning and staying productive and engaged and enjoying themselves than a child who has all of their family members either at work or needing to be engaged in work and unable to spend time supporting them throughout the day. There are a range of factors, many of which end up challenging, again, students of color and low-income students more than their white, wealthier peers.', 'It’s definitely the case that low-quality remote learning, or students struggling to even log in or have any access or interaction with their teachers, is at least as bad as what we’ve seen in past years for students losing ground over the summer, for example.', 'Diane Brady: You raise a good point about younger kids because they can’t engage in the same way. When you think about who needs to get into the classroom once it’s safe to be there, how would you rank the different groups?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: This is a tough question that every community in the US and around the world is thinking about, with some of them thinking about it differently. In general, there appears to be consensus that there are three groups of students for whom school systems are trying to bring back some form of supportive learnings first.', 'And those are basically the couple of groups that we’ve been talking about—those students who might be furthest behind in their learning because of access challenges in the spring or other challenges engaging in remote learning. Group one includes students who are experiencing greater challenges and are further behind and students with special needs that simply can’t be met outside of the classroom. In the US, that’d be students with IEPs [Individualized Education Programs]. Essentially, students who are receiving some sort of special-education service. Some of those programs can’t be effectively done remotely. So that’s another group of students that school systems should try to get back in person first.', 'We have learned, and it matches a lot of our intuition, that for the youngest students, it’s more difficult for them to engage in learning remotely. But also, if they’re home, families can’t go back to work. It’s also critical from an economic-activity standpoint and the ability to reopen and restart the broader economy—getting younger children back to school so that schools can perform what should be the secondary role of childcare.', 'Diane Brady: You mentioned how schools suddenly shut down. We’ve now had several months to plan. So how will remote learning look different?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: We’ve had a couple of months to plan. We’ve also had several months for schools and school systems to ask their families and their communities how it went and what they would like to see different. And I think there are a couple of things that are likely to change across many school systems as we get back to school.', 'The first is, I expect there will be more emphasis on what a full-day experience should look and feel like for students, for their families, and for the teachers. In the spring, it was basically do whatever we can. And there were often long stretches of time where students or their families didn’t know what they should be doing because educators hadn’t figured out what they should be doing at the moment, because it was new for everybody.', 'With time, there’s going to be a lot more purposeful planning for what an experience should look and feel like: How much of the day should be live instruction versus independent work? How much should be digital and online versus offline, paper and pencil, or just reading?', 'For live sessions, how much of that is big-group, whole-class instruction, versus small-group instruction with a teacher, versus one on one with a teacher, one on one with some other adult, or even small groups of individual students? More thoughtful experiences will be crafted for a student’s day.', 'With time, there’s going to be a lot more purposeful planning for what [a school-day] experience should look and feel like.', 'Diane Brady: Jimmy, what are some of the different ways to build a hybrid model?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: First, lay out the purpose of a hybrid model, as school systems are now thinking about how we can have some students in school, in person, while other students are home.', 'The main objective is to reduce the number of students physically in a school at a given time so that the school can practice a range of physical-distancing guidelines. And there are a few ways that school systems are trying to figure this out. The first is thinking about the old model of students receiving instruction and having experiences in school and then doing homework out of school but taking that to a wider extreme.', 'For example, if it’s a student’s turn to be in school on Monday and Tuesday and then home Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, on Monday and Tuesday, they would have lots of interaction with their teachers, lots of small-group practice. They would get lots of instruction on those two days and lots of social time in those two days. And then Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday would be more about practice and independent work, building on those two days of in-person instruction, much like we think about homework otherwise.', 'Diane Brady: Here in New York, I think we’re one of the few large school systems where parents have been given a choice between remote and hybrid. And it’s an agonizing decision. Do you have any advice?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: It’s a tough decision. I have a first grader starting in a public school in DC this year. We weren’t given a choice. In some ways, I’m thankful because I don’t know how to necessarily make that choice. Students are starting fully remote here.', 'It comes down to your own family’s risk factors and tolerance for risk and your own circumstances. There are, in some ways, no wrong answers but also no fully right answers at this time. It comes down to what each family thinks is best for their child: what’s best for their family in terms of both health-risk factors and financial, economic, and work realities and then the extent to which their child can thrive in or out of school.', 'Diane Brady: Obviously, keeping staff safe is important, too. One of the things that intrigues me about your background is that you, yourself, were a middle-school teacher. How does that inform how you view these issues?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: I now feel all sides. I was a middle-school teacher. I’m now a parent. And I work with leaders of school systems to help try to understand, from that vantage point, what to do. There’s not a week that goes by that I don’t think about my days in the classroom and my students during normal times. And lately, I think about it every day. I personally can’t imagine what it would be like, either, to teach all of my students—I had 115 every day back then—fully remotely.', 'Diane Brady: Where did you teach?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: I taught in DC public schools, at a middle school. The challenge of a teacher who’s been teaching for decades (or even just one year) fully in person and then having to switch to do that fully remotely is daunting. I definitely feel for all those teachers who are having to figure that out now.', 'The challenge of splitting that up and having some students in person on a couple of days and other students remote means, essentially, you could have to do twice as much planning and twice as much management at one time. And even if and when schools are back fully in person, before there’s a vaccine, there will be new challenges to deal with in maintaining physical distance, new routines, et cetera, all of which are different and new. Teaching was hard enough before we had a global pandemic to deal with. So I can certainly feel for them.', 'Diane Brady: I think I can hear your first grader.', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: I think that’s true. Day one of virtual school ended 30 minutes ago.', 'Diane Brady: Jimmy, what would your teacher self say to the parent that you are now? Any advice?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: I’m a bit reticent to take advice from my 12-years-younger self. But I think: hang in there, be patient, roll with it. This is new for all of us. Extend your child’s teacher a little bit of grace. Extend yourself a little bit of grace. But also, for my son, it’s his one chance to experience first grade. For every student out there, it’s their one chance to experience the grade that they’re in now.', 'Diane Brady: How about your parent and McKinsey selves? Any advice to teachers, in deference to the fact that it’s been 12 years since you’ve taught middle school?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: All teachers have relied on the support of families and parents in the past. But this year, that support is exponentially more important. Therefore, the level of communication, the frequency of communication, and the specificity of communication are going to be higher than they’ve ever been before. As a parent, I appreciate that the more conversation, the more interaction with my son’s teachers, no matter how much there is. That’s the main thing.', 'Diane Brady: There’s been a lot of discussion at the college level about rethinking college, as students sit in their rooms completing coursework. When you think about the K–12 system—I know it’s early days yet—what do you think the long-term impact of remote learning is likely to be on the model?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: That’s a great question. There are a few things that have changed pretty substantially since the spring. And we were just talking about parent engagement. Parent engagement is dramatically higher, not necessarily voluntarily, than it was a year ago at this time.', 'But what’s interesting is what many parents, when asked, are saying. Aside from supervising their children at home, the elements of engagement around understanding what their child is doing in school, wanting to know how they are doing, and planning to take more of a role in the response to how they are doing—those numbers are all high.', 'Parents are saying, at least for now, that they plan to stay as engaged as they are now. That’s one thing that will change. Schools are figuring out how to work more with parents. And that is likely to be a muscle that schools and school systems build that will stick around.', 'Diane Brady: What about the classroom model itself?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: There are two things that have changed and have the potential to be enduring changes. One is the level of technology use and the access to technology. The other is the role of the teacher. Everyone is upping their tech quotient and their tech skills during this time.', 'Some schools and school systems are building entire platforms that offer virtual instruction full time. Others are making lots of their content digital and putting content online. Whether it’s in small ways, such as always having a way to assign and have students practice work and instruction online, to big ways, such as always giving students some sort of online or virtual option, digital and online content will likely be here to stay in some shape or form.', 'In order for teachers to use these hybrid models, in order to have enough adult interaction with students in a physically distanced school setting or remotely, more adults are taking part in interactions with students.', 'Diane Brady: Do you mean more adults are taking part in interactions with students as coaches?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: Yes, such as when coaches in physical schools supervise a study hall while students practice independently. But what we’re finding is that schools are trying to figure out how to get teachers who have the skill and the experience to do things that only teachers can do, like share new content or deeply engage with a small group of students in practice.', 'Schools are trying to figure out how to extend the time that teachers do teacher things and spend less time supervising the cafeteria or even grading papers or planning lessons. That unbundling and redefinition of the teacher role to make sure teachers are spending time on things that only teachers can do is potentially something else that we’ll see change.', 'Diane Brady: It’s hard to separate out pandemic issues from school-system issues. But I’ve come to appreciate the social and emotional role that schools play. How much attention will be paid to that this fall?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: Lots of attention is being paid to that. Before the pandemic, we know that, in the US, at least 80 percent of all mental-health services and other social and emotional services that are provided to students happen through schools. Schools are an access point for children in communities.', 'And that’s likely to continue. What’s changed is the importance of that access point and the knowledge and awareness of the importance of it. There are reports in China of significant numbers of students self-reporting symptoms of depression or other mental-health issues following school closures earlier this year. We’re starting to hear at least anecdotal reports of that throughout the US.', 'I can’t say that we’ve come up with all the solutions right now. But certainly, ranging from small things, like schools dedicating the first week or two to simply building relationships and checking in on students emotionally, to larger efforts, such as deliberately building mental-health and emotional- and social-support elements into the curriculum, the solutions help in the day to day. Also, finding ways to support parents and engage family members in both checking in on their children and providing some support to their children on these topics while they’re at home is important.', 'Diane Brady: I’m glad you mentioned China because everybody has been dealing with fallout from the pandemic, clearly not just the US. What lessons, good and bad, can we learn from other markets?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: There are a couple of lessons we can learn. First, the context of the place matters. The actual health indicators, number of COVID-19 cases, trajectory of cases, hospital and broader healthcare-system capacity, and also the ability to test and contact trace—all of these contribute to a region’s ability to bring people back to school in person. That’s what we learned from both good and struggling cases abroad.', 'The other thing we learned was the value of communication and engagement with the community. We saw some international systems that basically decided on a Friday they were going to open up school on a Monday, had choppy and inconsistent communication with families and teachers, and then had to change guidance, almost on a daily basis, throughout the first couple of weeks. Systems such as that had pretty significant challenges with COVID-19-infection rates and with the ability to keep schools open.', 'Contrast that with other systems that made plans weeks in advance, phased in the start of school—some students in week one, more students in week two, and more students in week three—and had robust communication with families, teachers, and other stakeholders. They were able to have a much more seamless opening and fewer challenges with infection rates and other things.', 'I’d say those were the main things that we learned from early attempts at reopening in the spring. As we open up in the fall, and more school systems try getting more students back in person and have a more robust approach to the hybrid and remote learning, I think it’ll be important to collectively, as communities and as a field overall, deliberate about what questions we ask, what data we collect, and, therefore, what we can learn about what’s going on and what works.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting because while remote learning is new to me, there are many families around the world who have done this, to some extent, whether they’re homeschooling or otherwise. Any inspiration that we can take from them or even research on what parents, teachers, and students can do better in that environment is helpful.', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: You’re so right. Virtual learning has been around for a couple of decades. Granted, these are schools where families opted in to support their child’s learning at home and have their child learn remotely. But there are a few things that the most successful virtual-school networks and individual schools have done that can be instructive for schools now.', 'Some of the supports put in place for students include a dedicated text or chat line, especially for at-risk students—to connect them with, for example, an experienced tutor or peer. In such cases, virtual-engagement metrics are used to identify which students might need further one-to-one support or encouragement to engage—if, for example, they aren’t answering questions in a live chat or otherwise logging on.', 'We also see that the best virtual schools maintain something that looks like the routine of a typical in-person school day. Having a morning check-in, a midday touchpoint, an afternoon checkout, things like that, are helpful. Also, we know the virtual schools weren’t fully digital. They would mail not only computers but also books, printed materials, manipulatives, and other physical resources to students so they could use those throughout the school year.', 'Diane Brady: So they are virtual schools but without eight hours of remote learning?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: That’s right.', 'Diane Brady: Jimmy, what is a manipulative?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: Good question. They’re little things, objects, to help students count from one to ten—pegs on a pegboard, things like that. Tools they can use with their hands to improve their learning.', 'Diane Brady: Ah, fidget spinners. No?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: Yes, something like that.', 'Diane Brady: We don’t know when the pandemic will end; ergo, we don’t know when the current school situation will end. So as someone who researches and advises in this area, what’s on your radar right now?', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: There are two things. One is looking for school systems to be able to determine what they and their peers are doing on a pretty granular level, all the way from the health and safety protocols for in-person students to what in-person learning and other supports will be in place to which remote-learning models to use to make sure that, six months from now, we aren’t saying the same thing we were three months ago, which is that we’re trying lots of things but don’t know what works and what doesn’t.', 'That’s the main thing on my mind now: that we stay focused and we’re able to learn from the experiments and everything that people are trying right now. The second is, while a vaccine may still be many months out, there are other developments happening around our understanding of the virus and our understanding of how to essentially live and try to get as close to normal life as we can with the virus.', 'Research on what role children play in both contracting and transmitting the virus, what that means for their safety and the safety of adults in the classroom, advances our ability to test and contact trace and to increase the amount of in-person time that could happen for students in schools. Essentially, all this applies beyond schools to our broader economy and public-health situation and how we can use that to make it easier on schools to do the things that they need to do, which is focus on education and supporting students in other facets.', 'Diane Brady: I do want to end on your point, which stayed with me, about the learning loss of students, especially the number of months they have lost already. What advice do you have? It sounds like you almost have to accelerate learning to help kids catch up. As this goes on, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on how to address that.', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: We absolutely do. We know that there were opportunity gaps between different groups of students before the pandemic. We know the pandemic is widening those gaps. So we have to find ways to accelerate the learning for those students who fell most behind.', 'And we know there are some things that can do this: more intensive support for students who are behind, whether it’s through one-on-one tutoring, more time with highly effective teachers, or simply more time in school; longer school days, using time over the summer or other vacation breaks. But finding ways to have more time with students, more contact points, can help.', 'Another option is, we need to maintain our high expectations for students. There’s plenty of research that says students who are exposed to on-grade-level content are more likely to catch up than students who are catered to and only exposed to content that we think they can handle, without trying to challenge them.', 'And the third is not only to focus on the academics but also to support the whole child, everything from their relationships with the adults that are working with them to broader social and emotional supports that tend to their mental and physical health overall.', 'I think that the challenge to us all is, we know some of these things work. We’ve closed some achievement gaps in pockets before. But this is a whole new scale. So we need to invest as a society, as an education field, as families to do these things at a pace, a scale, and a level of intensity that, frankly, we haven’t been able to do before.', 'Diane Brady: I can’t think of a better place to end than here. Thank you very much, Jimmy.', 'Jimmy Sarakatsannis: Thank you, Diane. It was a pleasure.', 'Diane Brady: That was Jimmy Sarakatsannis, who coleads McKinsey’s education group in the US.

Here’s what companies can do to help their LGBTQ+ employees bring their authentic selves to work.","['Despite visible signs of progress, workplace challenges persist for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Here’s what companies can do to help their LGBTQ+ employees bring their authentic selves to work.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Diane Brady speaks with McKinsey senior partner Diana Ellsworth and Maital Guttman, senior manager of diversity and inclusion, about the unique challenges that members of the LGBTQ+ community face in the workplace. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast, I’m Diane Brady. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first Pride March in New York City, where a historic police raid at the Stonewall Inn sparked riots a year earlier. A lot has changed for people in the LGBTQ+ community. The US Supreme Court has upheld the right to marry a same-sex partner and, most recently, to be protected against discrimination at work. 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 590 U.S. (2020); “Brief of 206 businesses as amici curiae in support of the employees,” Supreme Court, July 3, 2019, Numbers 17–1618, 17–1623, 18–107, supremecourt.gov.\\r               \\r \\r  But courts don’t create an inclusive work culture, companies do. More important, people do. And on that front, the McKinsey Quarterly has just published a global study about the unique challenges that LGBTQ+ employees still face. I’m joined by two colleagues who helped to lead this global study. Diana Ellsworth is a partner in the Atlanta office, where Maital Guttman is a senior manager of Diversity and Inclusion. Diana and Maital, welcome. Diana, tell us a little more about the study.', 'Diana Ellsworth: Thanks, Diane. As you mentioned, we’ve seen a lot of movement in the US and around the world in recent years related to the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. A lot of steps forward, in some cases some steps backward—but we know that this community is underrepresented still in organizations. And particularly in leadership levels of organizations.', 'And so we wanted to dig in and understand, both from a survey and also from stories, anecdotes, and experiences of LGBTQ+ leaders, about the challenges that employees face\\xad—so that we could understand and help to address those challenges and help to shape the way organizations and leaders think about this segment of their employees and how to support them.', 'Diane Brady: Maital, what stood out for you? I mean, one thing that’s interesting is not everybody necessarily comes out at work, do they?', 'Maital Guttman: In fact, we found that only about one in four LGBTQ+ of our respondents are not broadly out at work. Even though there is more visibility, more conversation, and more and more people identifying as LGBTQ+, we’re seeing that in the workplace—especially for younger colleagues, junior colleagues, women, and people outside of the US and Europe—that they are less likely to be out at work.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting, because the younger generation, I would’ve thought, would be more open about that. Is that just, to some extent, your place on the ladder?', 'Maital Guttman: We think so. That’s part of what it is when you are joining a workplace, you’re still trying to navigate—even if they have all the right policies in place—you’re still trying to navigate how you bring your authentic self to work.', 'And so you look around at senior leadership. You look around at your managers. You look for the visible cues, in your office or with your clients, about how much you can be out and how open.', 'And unfortunately, what we found is that people are still too often the “only.” They’re the only LGBTQ+ person on their team or at their clients. And they are still more likely to experience microaggressions. They’re still more likely to hear derogatory remarks or have to correct people’s assumptions about their personal lives.', 'Unfortunately, what we found is that people are still too often the ‘only.’', 'Diane Brady: Diana, tell me a little more about microaggressions. What exactly does that tend to look like?', 'Diana Ellsworth: It can look a variety of different ways. Inherent in the notion of the microaggression, these aren’t the egregious, flagrant sort of acts of discrimination that certainly exist as well. But these are the small pieces that add up over time. A lot of that can do with making assumptions about somebody’s personal life outside of work.', 'It can be around people feeling like they need to back up what they say even more, to be taken as credibly as someone else would be. And these small microaggressions impact somebody’s experience, as they pile up one on top of another.', 'Diane Brady: So let me go to the fact that women are less likely to come out, and to speak with both of you about that. Diana, I’m going to go to you first. Tell me about your own experience in the workplace, and were you reluctant yourself to talk? Sexual orientation is not something most of us feel like we need to disclose; it’s optional.', 'Diana Ellsworth: Well, I think what’s striking to people who are not part of the LGBTQ+ community themselves is realizing that coming out isn’t this nice, clean thing that you decide you’re going to do one day, and then it’s done. It’s actually a big part of your daily or your weekly experience. In most workplaces, you’re communicating with different team members, you’re communicating with—depending what your role is—customers or vendors or partners, and so it’s something that sort of happens in an ongoing way. You know, in our research, we found that nearly half of our respondents said that they come out at work at least once a week. And, one in ten said they do it on a daily basis.', 'Diane Brady: So when somebody asks who your husband is, you have to correct them. When you’re talking to a client, is that the incidents where these things come up?', 'Diana Ellsworth: Exactly. And so that’s where, when I think about it for myself, it just made such a big difference to be out, and out broadly at work. And I think it’s on two different levels. One, it just takes out some of that effort and background stress of filtering, right? Which is what you inherently have to do if you’re not out. Because for people who are straight, they don’t have to come out—but they can casually mention who they went to a movie with or who lives with them in a way that they don’t think about as coming out as straight, but that’s  exactly what it is. And so, for me, once I was out and could openly talk about who I was dating or who became my wife, it just changed the dynamic.', 'It took out that filter and background stress. And on the positive side, it just created a different level of connection with people, right? I was suddenly being a much fuller, more authentic, more open version of myself. Which just contributed to much deeper relationships in the workplace.', 'Diane Brady: Were you senior in your career or fairly junior?', 'Diana Ellsworth: I’ve been at McKinsey over ten years now, and I was out when I joined McKinsey. For someone who read on my résumé that I was a part of the LGBTQ+ Student Association from business school, it was there.', 'But then again, if I think about it, few people read my résumé, right? So it was much a matter of conversation after conversation, day after day, week after week, and in some cases, year after year. It was a trickling out from the time I joined.', 'Diane Brady: Maital, I’d love to hear about your story and also the fact that you handle diversity and inclusion, and as Diana said, you can look on a résumé and see somebody’s affiliation, for example. But it’s not something that jumps out at you; it’s not something you can necessarily recruit for. So tell me a little bit more about both your own experiences and what you’ve noticed as you talk about this with colleagues—and with clients as well.', 'Maital Guttman: It’s such an interesting point, because there’s coming out in the workplace, there’s coming out to your family, there’s even coming out to yourself. I like that it’s an active verb, because it is a process. And so, for some of our folks, they might not yet be out yet to their families.', 'But they want to be out at work. Or vice versa. So I think it is important to say, “You don’t have to come out, but we want to create an environment where if you are out, if you do want to be out, that you can.” For me, my parents found out that I was queer when I was 14. And I remember seeing the first time I ever saw my dad cry. And they would identify as liberal; my dad’s a rabbi in the South, but he has gay friends. Even though they would identify as liberal, it was different when it was their own child. And what I’ve come to understand is that what felt different for them was they were almost mourning what they thought my life would be like.', 'And they were nervous that American society and workplaces would not be welcoming, and so my life would be much harder than what they hoped it would be. What’s been amazing is their journey of also coming out and being comfortable—seeing how they’re coming out as parents of an LGBTQ+ child and also then as my dad became a big advocate. He officiated our wedding several years ago. And a huge part of that, I think, has been that there’s been tremendous progress in the US in the past couple of decades—and seeing how I married, had a baby; I’m pregnant with our second one.', 'Diane Brady: Congratulations.', 'Maital Guttman: Thank you, thank you. And in a workplace, in places like McKinsey—McKinsey is not the only place; it’s almost become table stakes for many of the large Fortune 500 companies that you need to be inclusive and that they are celebrating their LGBTQ+ folks. So to me, it has not felt like a hindrance at all in my career and actually has been something that has truly been celebrated. I think it’s an incredibly exciting time.', 'Now, there’s a lot more work to be done, but seeing how you can be an out professional and that it is something that is celebrated by companies—it’s not something that we would’ve thought would’ve been true 20 years ago.', 'Diane Brady: Well, and it’s a good point, Diana, that the zeitgeist is changing. We have the pandemic, Black Lives Matter, the Supreme Court decision—how do you think that those events affect LGBTQ+ issues?', 'Diana Ellsworth: This is just such a complicated time we’re living in right now. I think one thing that stands out is this notion of different aspects of people’s identity and certainly intersectionality. We’re living in this world now, this moment, particularly in the US but even globally, where, here we are in June, which is Pride Month, and yet here we are in the midst of a real reckoning on racial equity. And this idea that these communities aren’t separate from one another: they intersect, and they’re members of multiple underrepresented groups who face increased discrimination or increased disadvantage because of that. And I think this is just a moment where we’re acutely aware of how those different pieces come together.', 'Diane Brady: And I think about the importance of having allies. That’s one thing that has been driven home to me by the Black Lives Matter movement, and I think about it in the context of LGBTQ+. I want to get to some of the voices. One of the great things about this study to me is all the stories. It’s very much the stories and the voices of the people and the experiences in the workplace. It does drive home that good policies and protections aren’t enough.', 'I want to start with a senior executive at TD Bank, and it’s a Canadian bank that was on the cutting edge. Being a Canadian, I remember in the early ’90s, they came out with policies around same-sex marriage. Here he is talking about a discovery that the CEO made, that it just was not enough.', 'TD Bank executive: TD was one of the first major banks in Canada that offered same-sex benefits in 1994 to our employees. At the time, we had about 50,000 employees in the bank. When I asked asked HR, “What’s the take-up rate?,” it was 90. It was abysmal. Ninety, because people thought Big Brother was watching them.', 'Diane Brady: What’s that? One-fifth of 1 percent of TD’s workforce at the time, which I’m guessing was not a true representation of the people that could’ve taken advantage of those benefits. Diana, what was the CEO doing wrong? And more important, perhaps, what did he start doing right?', 'Diana Ellsworth: I think that’s great, with the question, “What did he start doing right?,” because I think the reality is he probably, in his core, was accepting and embracing to begin with.', 'And what I don’t think he was doing, or what it sounds like he wasn’t doing, was demonstrating that in a visible, authentic way that set the tone for the organization. And so there are a lot of reasons why people are hesitant, and they are looking for those signs that say, “This is a safe space, a supportive space, an inclusive space.” And that sign does need to come from the top. It’s not sufficient to just come from the top, but it is critical that it does come from the top and that people do know that discrimination, a lack of respect, won’t be tolerated, and in fact, the opposite is required and encouraged.', 'People look for a safe, supportive, and inclusive space. It’s critical that it comes from the top.', 'Diane Brady: Maital, let’s pretend I’m a CEO, and I come to you. What advice do you have for me? I’ve sent out the message that this is important. What else?', 'Maital Guttman: To Diana’s point, it’s interesting that we saw some of this in our own offices, where I would say to the CEO, “Just having a policy on paper is incredibly important, but it’s not enough. You need to role-model what inclusion looks like. That’s showing up, that’s being visible, and that’s a public display, both internally and externally, of support. Even casually mentioning somebody’s significant other and partner sends a strong signal, especially to the LGBTQ+ employees who themselves might not yet be out.', 'It reminds me of a story. We celebrate a global Day of Pink, where we basically ask our allies to wear pink in April to show their support for the LGBTQ+ community. And we’ve had offices where you would expect, because of the legal landscape or even just the cultural landscape of the country that they’re in, you would expect them to be LGBTQ+ friendly. But what we found in some of our surveys is there’s a couple offices where it stood out as surprising that that they weren’t. And when we dug a little bit deeper, it wasn’t the policies, it was the—are there enough visible senior leaders who are taking a stance and showing support? What was exciting was when we then did an intervention: we had a couple—it was just a handful of people—who said, “This is not right; we want to make sure that our LGBTQ+ folks feel included.”', 'They participated in Day of Pink. They marched in Pride. They made sure that there was communication about how important being inclusive is and how important our GLAM and LGBTQ+ network is. 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             GLAM (grow, lead, advance, mobilize) is a professional network and supportive community for LGBTQ+ colleagues at McKinsey.\\r               \\r \\r  And in only one year, the responses to the question, “How open is your office to LGBTQ+ people?,” jumped 20 or 30 points. So, to me, it’s  such a good reminder that a lot of change can happen in a short amount of time if you’re sending the right signals, particularly from leadership but  throughout the entire organization. There’s a ton of opportunities for allies to show up.', 'Diane Brady: The opposite of that is very interesting, too. Because I know it’s a global study, and there are, of course, parts of the world where it’s illegal to be in a same-sex relationship. And yet there are still ways to show support. I’m thinking of—was it a nail-polish station that you had, Diana?', 'Diana Ellsworth: So yeah, one of the stories that we heard was similar to our Day of Pink—it was an organization that encouraged employees to paint a fingernail purple in support of the community and set up these, as you referenced them, nail-polish stations at multiple places, to make it easy. This is a 30-second exercise, right, during your day, or you’re on your way to the coffee bar, to stop and paint a fingernail purple. But people were amazed by how many people did it, and it created a little bit of a viral, I think, energy and momentum, and just this visible sign of support for the community. Again, the interviewee who talked about it—it was striking how much this small thing set the stage in a different way for what the level of support was within the broad employee base.', 'Diane Brady: I want to get to another one of the voices, which is around leadership, and as a leader, of course, you’re a role model, but you know sexual orientation can be private—to identity can be private. And it creates an extra pressure and responsibility. So I want to refer to one woman who came out in a very public way about a decade ago, in a video to help LGBTQ+ kids that were at risk of suicide. And she recalls how it was transformative. Here she is.', 'Recording (“Beth”): We’ve got to be advocates. We have a duty and obligation to not just be out but also to use our platforms as visible LGBTQ+ role models, to help change the world.', 'We’ve got to be advocates. We have a duty and obligation to not just be out but also to use our platforms as visible LGBTQ+ role models, to help change the world.', 'Diane Brady: So, Diana, talk a little bit about that. She—I know she was 52 at the time. Is that quite common?', 'Diana Ellsworth: I think you find people come out at all sorts of different ages and life stages and tenures in organizations. And I think it’ll be interesting to see how that changes over time as well. I think it’s not uncommon, Beth’s experience.', 'Diane Brady: So a duty and an obligation, Diana. Do you think that’s fair?', 'Diana Ellsworth: I think a lot of people do feel that way. Maybe an opportunity is perhaps the more positive spin on obligation. But I think we heard from a lot of our survey respondents and interviewees, and I can certainly say personally, I feel the same way. There is a real opportunity to demonstrate for others that you can be happy, satisfied, successful, and out.', 'And I think it’s for younger employees; it’s for people who just have greater challenges. I mean, I referenced intersectionality before. There’s a piece of it that’s that.', 'There’s also a piece of it—that is, the trans experience today is very different than it is for other members of the LGBTQ+ community, who are cisgender, who identify with the same gender they were born with. And so as we think about that whole different set of experiences, there’s something powerful about there being visible role models who are willing to talk about it and be seen, and who create a sense of, “You are not the ‘only,’ whoever you are, whatever you’re feeling.” There’s a positive path forward.', 'Maital Guttman: I just want to add I think it’s such a good point, and if you think about the broader context of where we are, and the conversations that we’re having in the workplace—they are pretty courageous right now, and can even be uncomfortable, whether we’re talking about LGBTQ+, or we’re talking about race, or we’re talking about intersectionality. Not everybody feels like they have the right vocabulary and tools to have those conversations. But I am quite amazed that it gives a sense of purpose to people when they do come out. And even though—like what Diana referenced earlier in the conversation—even though people are still coming out every week, and still reference that oftentimes, almost 40 percent of the time in the last month, at least one of the coming-out experiences was uncomfortable.', 'So even for people like Diana and myself, who are very out, it’s still a conscious decision every time we come out. Because it’s not guaranteed to be a comfortable conversation. But to me, and I think to many people, the idea that you make it easier for the next person—to me, it gives a lot of that extra oomph of courage, to be able to have those uncomfortable conversations and be out when sometimes it might just feel easier not to.', 'Diane Brady: Well, let’s unpack intersectionality for a second, because I think that’s a term, certainly, that is relatively new to me, and it is, in some ways, about how we all have multiple identities. And maybe one of the ways to set up this part is to refer to a clip where we’re talking with somebody who was in London, who didn’t become aware of racial bias until he moved to the US. Let’s take a listen.', 'Recording: I never realized the color of my skin when I lived in the UK. Maybe I was very lucky. It was an inclusive environment; my corporate environment was inclusive. But when I moved to the US for the first time, I felt the color of my skin. I felt like a second-class citizen.', 'Diane Brady: Does that surprise you at all, Diana?', 'Diana Ellsworth: I think that people are constantly having to navigate different environments. I haven’t ever worked in the UK, but his experience sounds quite positive. I think, if anything, that would be the side that surprises me. The fact that he was conscious of the color of his skin in the US does not surprise me.', 'And that he was navigating that while also navigating his experience as a gay man—it adds complexity to it and challenge to the choices he makes on a daily, if not hourly, basis.', 'Diane Brady: Let me ask about the Supreme Court decision, because I recall that it was something like half of US major employers have policies in place. What do you think is going to change, both in terms of the pressure, the legal environment? Are you getting any more interest from clients, for example, in addressing these issues as a result of that decision?', 'Diana Ellsworth: I think the impact of the Supreme Court decision cannot be [overstated]. I think the impact is going to be incredibly broad. It’s going to have impact on employers, like you suggested. There are many states where this fundamentally changes the way people are going to think about precedent related to employment. But also things like housing and education and healthcare. At its core, this decision gives individuals across the US recourse at the federal level that they didn’t previously have. And so it’s a game changer.', 'Maital Guttman: And I would add, I think that’s it. I agree, and to me, it almost felt like we were not expecting it, and what a great surprise—just some great news coming out of the Supreme Court. But in some ways, it still doesn’t feel like quite enough. It is a recognition that employers shouldn’t be discriminating against LGBTQ+ people.', 'But to me, it also emphasized the need for broader legislation to make sure that we’re not—that it is more institutionalized in our laws and policies, as Diana said, beyond employment. It’s one of the reasons we’ve signed on as supporters of the Equality Act, to make sure that there’s not discrimination across many different dimensions.', 'Just the Friday beforehand, there was a ruling that—the administration basically said that they would not include transgender as a protected status in the Affordable Care Act. So I think it is incredibly important in the Supreme Court. My wife and I got married on the steps of the Supreme Court, because we were so grateful of their decisions, and it’s the reason we were able to get married when she was not a US citizen. But I think there’s—we need much more legislative protection as well.', 'Diane Brady: Well, and it does feel like—that transgender is one of the newer areas that people are coming to terms with. I want to hear from one other voice. I’ll give the description that she gives, actually: “Mother; divorced; I’m queer, lesbian, Latinx, and Mexican.” Let’s listen to what she has to say about how we can make the workplace more inclusive for people who are transgender and other identities.', 'Recording: Don’t use the term “guys”; use “hey, friends,” “hi, folks,” “hey, everyone,” “hey, you all.” Those are the sorts of things that are not necessarily financially a heavy lift. They can be done relatively easily. The heavy lifts can be further topics of discussion in the years to come. But there’s a lot of simple work that could be happening that’s not happening.', 'Diane Brady: It’s interesting, and Maital, I want to talk to you about this, because we do think a lot about cost, and we think about the cost of doing this. I’d like you to think about the cost of not doing it. It’s not just an employee-engagement tool. Why is it important to have these kinds of policies and practices?', 'Maital Guttman: It’s a great question. One of the big surprises out of the research was when we asked if people had not taken a job or not pursued a company because they felt that it was not an inclusive work environment, and 58 percent of LGBTQ+ respondents said that they had not taken a job. But what was surprising, I think, to several of us was the high levels of—40 percent of all respondents said that they would pass up a job if they didn’t feel that the company was inclusive enough. So this is something: that having an inclusive culture is incredibly important to employees.', 'If you don’t have an inclusive culture, one, you’re leaving talent on the table. You’re not going to get the best talent. Two, if they do come, they’re less likely to be engaged or to stay. Three, they’re less likely to be able to authentically bring themselves to work and fully be able to participate and engage, and get the best out of them. It’s one reason that I think we’ve seen that more diversity in the workplace, and especially at the top, yields better financial results. This is not something that’s just a nice to have, a good thing to do, which it is, but it’s actually good for business. And to her point, that it doesn’t have to cost—some of this doesn’t have to cost much, right?', 'One of the interesting things, now that everybody’s videoconferencing virtually, is that it allows people to have their names and their pronouns next to their names on their screen names. It allows for more people to signal inclusion, to be less likely to misgender people. And doing that is free. So there’s a lot that can be done to create that inclusive culture.', 'Having an inclusive culture is incredibly important to employees. If you don’t have an inclusive culture, you’re leaving talent on the table.', 'Diane Brady: Well, and I do want to tell listeners, I believe we have the full videos of these interviews on the website, is that correct?', 'Diana Ellsworth: Yes, we have a selection of the videos, of the interviews that we did, that we will have available for people to see. And again, there’s something about reading the quotes; there’s something better about hearing it. But to see the faces behind the experiences, I think, is quite powerful.', 'Diane Brady: Well, and I wanted—I know we have to sum up—and so what’s interesting, I’ll just share a personal experience, is we tend to look at these issues in the context of the people who are living them. And it’s a much wider ecosystem.', 'Maital, you mentioned your parents, and it’s certainly something that has come into my life through my children. But even my dad, I remember, in the late ’80s, he was a carpet salesman, and the moment of pride for our family was seeing him march in the Pride Parade, because he installed commercial carpet at the first AIDS hospice. And the pride that he felt, the pride that our family felt—these are much bigger, broader issues than simply the people who are living them.', 'Maital Guttman: It’s such an important point. I remember, we did an LGBTQ+ training, an allyship training in one of our offices. And we asked people to raise their hand if they felt comfortable if they themselves identified as LGBTQ+, and a handful of people raised their hand. And then we said, “Well, who has family members?” And about half the group raised their hand. And then we asked, “Well, who has close friends and family?” And I would say almost 90 percent of the room raised their hands.', 'So the concept of inclusion and who is part of the LGBTQ+ community—it’s so much broader than the people themselves or the employees themselves. One of the things I’ve found to be a trend is that people who are talking much more recently are parents who have LGBTQ+ children. And actually, we have a growing number of parents whose children are trans and have come to us and said, “I’m so proud to be working here and so grateful for our inclusive culture and for our offerings and our resources. Because I know that I belong and that my family belongs.” And so those who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community is just growing. And that matters to people.', 'Diane Brady: So let’s end with a call to action of some sort or some takeaway. Pivoting off the study, I will, again, go to the McKinsey Quarterly to get it. I recommend it highly—a terrific look at insights on what the current experience is. But for listeners, what would you have them do? Could be one thing, two things. Give us some advice or inspiration to head off and make a difference. Diana, I’m going to start with you.', 'Diana Ellsworth: I might say two things. One is at the personal and individual level, which is one way you influence an inclusive culture. And that is about, How do you give the visible signs? How do you use the inclusive language? How do you put up a sticker that shows your ally support in your office window, if we end up back in offices with windows at some point? How do you attend events? But I think there’s something as an individual, which is about being visible in your support for the LGBTQ+ community.', 'The second thing, at the organizational level, is to say, “How do we make the ‘only’ experience that Maital referenced earlier rarer? How do we strengthen our talent pipeline, as it comes to LGBTQ+ employees?” That’s everything from thinking more creatively about where you source your talent at the beginning to looking at your performance-management processes and making sure there isn’t bias in them in some ways. It’s about making sure employees are sponsored by more senior members of the organization.', 'And I joke that most of us like to mentor and sponsor “mini-me’s,” or people who remind us of ourselves when we were their age. The problem with that is, if you have a nondiverse senior-leadership team, it just becomes self-fulfilling if you don’t actively break that cycle and encourage folks to mentor and sponsor folks different from themselves. But I think there’s a real role in organizations saying, “Let us look across our whole talent pipeline and figure out how to drive greater diversity through the whole thing.”', 'Diane Brady: Yeah. We do tend to recognize excellence in a form that reminds us of ourselves, don’t we? Maital, how about you? Call to action.', 'Maital Guttman: I think we’re in a pivotal moment in history. You know, COVID-19 is impacting us globally. Certainly, racial-justice issues in the US and beyond. And what I think that is doing is we’re realizing we might all be in the same storm, but we have different boats.', 'And some of those boats are not as well equipped as others or aren’t as—they’re not all created equal. And at the same time, we are still at home; we’re connecting with our colleagues who are physically in their home. And so the boundaries of our lives are much harder to separate. And so, to me, I think this is an opportunity to lean into that. To check in with folks, to listen, to let them bring their authentic parts of their lives, regardless of or because of their different identities. To be open to that and to encourage those conversations. To lean into the vulnerability and to have those brave and courageous conversations. This is, I think, such a unique time for us to be able to listen to each other—to learn and then to take action.', 'Diane Brady: Wise words, Maital. Thank you both very much for your time.', 'Diana Ellsworth: Thank you so much for having us.', 'Maital Guttman: Really enjoyed the conversation. Thanks so much.', 'Diane Brady: If you want to hear more, go to the McKinsey Quarterly. I’m Diane Brady, thanks.', 'Diana Ellsworth is a partner in McKinsey’s Atlanta office, where Maital Guttman is a senior manager for diversity and inclusion.

To do it successfully, an organization needs the strengths of an incumbent and the agility of a start-up.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey partners Vaibhav Gujral and Ido Segev about business building. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Diane Brady: Hello, welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. With COVID-19, we’re hearing a lot about how companies need to reinvent themselves, or disrupt. But how do you build a new business within a business? It could be a new product or service, or maybe it’s the germ of an idea that could transform the entire company. Simon London speaks with Vaibhav Gujral, a partner in McKinsey’s New York office, and Ido Segev, a partner who specializes in digital strategies, out of Boston.', 'Simon London: Vaibhav and Ido, welcome to the podcast and thank you for being here.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: Thank you, Simon.', 'Ido Segev: Happy to be here.', 'Simon London: So this is in some ways not a new topic. We’re going to be talking about business building, I think is how we would frame it. But people also talk about intrapreneurship within companies, corporate venturing. There’s a lot of, you know, literature around this over many years, so maybe, Ido, you take a first whack at this. Why is this a big topic now?', 'Ido Segev: I think the thing is to recognize that longevity as a successful business is correlated with the ability to reinvent yourself. Maybe, you know, two stats to tee up. The first is, 50 years ago, the average life span of a company in the Fortune 500 was 60 years. It is only 20 years right now. So, you know, companies come in and out of the Fortune 500 list much, much faster.', 'The second stat is, if you look at the—six of the top ten companies in the largest companies in the world right now are companies that reinvented themselves. So think about Amazon, started in e-commerce, AWS, just as an example. Think about Apple. Think about Google. What they have done over the years, you know, to their business model.', 'The second thing, I would say, is that the pace of change in many industries is massive right now. The customer expectations are rising and changing very, very quickly. The availability of technology to disrupt an industry is becoming faster and faster. Think capital and changes over time, but there is a lot of capital right now that goes into industries.', 'The implication of that is that new models are going to emerge, and they’re going to emerge in the next, you know, two to three years. And at the beginning, they will be nascent, but ten years from now, those new models are going to be big. If you’re an incumbent, you need to think about that, because if you don’t, and if you don’t invest in actually changing your business model, you won’t be able to participate when a new business model comes in. And by then, it might be too late.', 'Longevity as a successful business is correlated with the ability to reinvent yourself.', 'Simon London: And to your point, it’s not just, you know, the usual suspects in the sense of e-commerce was in the front line of this—you know, publishing, those media-type companies are at the front line of this. So yes, it’s not just those sorts of frontline industries anymore.', 'So Vaibhav, I would guess that the odds of success at doing this are pretty low. So what do we know about the odds? And also what’s our advice to clients about what are the key things to try and beat the odds of building a business and getting it to scale?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: That’s a great question. The way to think about the odds of success in these businesses is what would have the odds been if you were a pure start-up, starting this business in that sector, trying to disrupt the same business, versus what are the odds if you’re a large Fortune 500 company, investing in any initiative. It doesn’t need to be a disruptive initiative. It could be any initiative, right?', 'And the reality is the odds are somewhere in between, right? Our research shows that the odds of success of Fortune 500 companies or Fortune 100 companies investing in significant new business builds or ventures is about one in six, which is lower than the odds of, on an ROI basis, initiatives that you’re investing in as a corporate but is much better than the odds of success of the average—', 'Simon London: It’s better than VC?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: It’s much better than VC, right? And the reason for that, and to your point, the odds of success is, right, there are three things that are fundamentally different about large companies starting these ventures.', 'The first is you’re starting with some form of “competitive” advantage. That competitive advantage could come in the form of distribution or unique access to customers, or it could come in the form of data or proprietary insight or some form of technology that you’ve developed where you have a moat or IP privileges around that. Start-ups don’t have that, so they don’t have access to five million or ten million customers.', 'And the second is capitalization, right? As a large company, not only can you fund the seed round, but you can fund the series A, B, C round. And as a start-up founder, you spend an inordinate amount of time fund-raising. One of the core things you’re doing as a founder and CEO is not just marshaling the product and your team, but spending a lot of time going out there and fund-raising.', 'And last thing I’d say is that you’ve got unique expertise and talent that sits in the parent organization. These new businesses are often truly new ventures, but they’re not in domains that are completely detached from what the parent is doing.', 'Simon London: And then what will we say to clients about how do you beat the odds?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: So the first thing is, if you’ve got a really clear and good sense of what your core competitive advantages are and you’re leveraging those for building these new businesses, the odds of success, in our view, go up significantly. We’ve done a ton of research on this—on companies that are following and chasing others tend to not succeed.', 'Companies that start with a really clear understanding of what their competitive advantage is—it typically falls into either a distribution-type advantage, where you’ve got unique access to customers. The second type of distinct advantage could be access to data or proprietary insight that you have that others don’t have. The third may be some regulatory advantage or structural advantage, based on the sector that you’re operating in.', 'The second, I’d add, is this really needs to come from the top. When initiatives start driven by the CEO and the management team, with a real commitment to success and taking a three- to five-year horizon, versus thinking of this as an experiment, it radically improves your odds of success.', 'Simon London: So the CEO needs to be out there, being very clear that his is a significant bet, this is not an experiment? This is a multiyear journey, and this is like the future? And if you don’t do that, you don’t get the buy-in internally, and you don’t necessarily attract the talent that you need to scale?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: That’s exactly right. And you know, what comes along with that is a commitment to funding it, right? If you evaluate these initiatives with the same 12-year annual budgeting process, return-on-investment-type lens, many of them would not cross the bar. And invariably, you’ll end up in a situation where you’re competing for resources six months, 12 months, 18 months in.', 'A lot of the counsel we give our clients is actually thinking about creating real long-term sustainable businesses where you’re generating either equivalent margins once the business is stabilized to your core business or slightly better margins. The reality is, most digital and tech-led businesses, which a lot of these tend to be, over the long run, once you’ve established the infrastructure platform, people, and talent, will generate a healthier margin than most existing businesses that are trying to disrupt themselves.', 'Ido Segev: Those who are successful are really, really successful. So we’re talking about building billion-dollar businesses and even more, and so, anybody who is thinking about that needs to compare the two, right?', 'Simon London: Right.', 'Ido Segev: And you know, there’s outsize impact if you’re successful. Yes, it’s difficult, but it is outsize impact. And frankly, if you’re not thinking that big, [it’s] maybe not worth going after it to begin with.', 'Simon London: Yep.', 'Ido Segev: And acknowledging that the people that you have running your business, as good as they might be, might actually not be the ones that you need in order to launch a new venture. Some of them might, but by and large, I think our experience shows that there are other types of skills that you need in order to be successful, and those might reside outside your organization.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: The talent point is a fantastic one, because what it also creates is initially a cultural clash between a set of people coming in from very different backgrounds, relative to the industries of the incumbent or the players that are building the new businesses.', 'Creating the right process for integrating that talent and embracing that culture to change is critically important. Those who are able to do this well are able to drive a reinvention and a dynamism in the core. Those who don’t do it well continue to have this sitting in a different building, in an innovation lab, at arm’s length, where people in the headquarters building will point to them and say, “These are guys running their experiments,” as opposed to truly embracing that cultural change that comes with this.', 'Creating the right process for integrating that talent and embracing that culture to change is critically important. Those who are able to do this well are able to drive a reinvention and a dynamism in the core.', 'Simon London: So it’s not a choice between either building a new business or reinventing your core business? If you get this right, actually building a new business helps accelerate the innovation in the core?', 'Ido Segev: That’s absolutely right. They feed on each other, and I think strategically both are important, because, you know, many of our clients, they need to focus on the core and the next, you know, two to three years, but if they don’t also think about reinventing themselves, they might be out of business—to the point we made earlier—ten years out.', 'Simon London: Yeah.', 'Ido Segev: So you need to do both, and there’s a lot of reinforcing mechanisms—', 'Vaibhav Gujral: Just to give you a tangible example on it, we started in the business-building journey a couple of years ago, with a large team in the US. They initially built a new business which over time had 50 to 100 people that were staffed on the team, but the reality is it created the conviction and confidence in the parent to embark on a whole range of new initiatives. And they’ve got a pipeline of 15 new businesses that are being worked on across the portfolio now.', 'That’s really powerful. You’re using this as a catalyst and as an engine to create a pipeline of new businesses and ideas. Not all of them will go anywhere, but one in five or six will actually go there. And you’ve created that pipeline of bets.', 'One of the things most large companies underestimate is they want to get one idea, and they want to try and get that one idea right. The reality is you have to start on the journey. You have to build that talent, and you have to build that DNA. And you’ll figure the ideas out.', 'Simon London: So this is the initiatives-type idea? You need different initiatives like this at different stages of maturity. But I mean, I’m also hearing that when the time comes to say, “Yes, we’re going to build a business,” you actually have to make a pretty big commitment, and you’ve got to make clear that this is for the long term, it’s going to be expensive, the return profile is going to be very different to standard capex. But, you know, there comes a certain point where you actually need to decide to go big. Is that right?', 'Ido Segev: I think you need to go in knowing that those ventures take three to five years to break even. On a customer-vantage level, they might actually break even sooner, but basically to recoup the capital expenditure at the beginning takes, like, three to five years.', 'And I think you also need to have a process to evaluate the progress of the venture that is very different from the way that you evaluate your annual budget—you know, investments. One of the things that I’ve done with one of my clients is the VC would meet with the intrapreneur on a quarterly basis, and they would go through, like, certain parameters that are very different from what the head of a company would go—the CEO. They would go at, you know, your burn rate. They would go at, you know, how many clients have you acquired. They would go at what’s your cost to acquire those, and they would compare those to, like, a set of parameters or metrics that they had in the top-down business case.', 'And then, based on that decision, they would say, “Are we moving from series A funding to series B funding? Are we giving you the next thing? Or what would we want, you know, to see in order to give th—?” That is a very, very different way of thinking about the business and funding the business that you have to embrace.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: Once you’ve got the product-market fit right and you’ve derisked that, you’ve got to be ready to commit and double down, right? As you’re going through stages of whether you think of that, as Ido was describing, a series B—going between series A to series B—the first thing you’re trying to do is get the product right and figuring out what customer need you’re solving. And you’re experimenting with a range of ways to solve that customer need.', 'But once you’ve got that product-market fit right, you’ve got to be ready to double down, because then—otherwise, there was no point in you having embarked on the journey to start with. That said, you know, the savviest players are ones that are smart about capital structure. And it doesn’t need to be entirely your capital.', 'And if you think of these as truly new businesses, which you can potentially separate from the parent over time, and they take on a life of their own, you can bring in other investors. And you’ve got to make a deliberate choice at some point of do you have all the capabilities and talent and assets that’s going to make the business successful, or does that better belong in partnership with others, or can you benefit from the expertise of bringing others in.', 'Simon London: So we’ve touched on a couple of elements of this, but I want to double-click on the question of the relationship between the new business and the parent, so to speak. Again, there’s a lot written in the literature about how to get this right and how to get it wrong. Ido, what would you say? How do you get this relationship right, and what are the factors to consider? I think the whole premise, you know—to go, if you’re an incumbent, to go and build, you know, something, and we talked about it—is the fact that you have some competitive advantage that you could leverage vis-à-vis a start-up, right?', 'Ido Segev: So you have a customer base. You have a balance sheet. You have distribution. You have stuff that actually could be quite valuable. In fact, start-ups, you know, would die to have that, so that basically suggests, “I can’t really be completely separated.”', 'Simon London: So this is the incumbent’s advantage? There’s a book—actually it was written by a McKinsey guy, right, many years ago—called The Attacker’s Advantage.', 'Ido Segev: So this will be the incumbent—', 'Simon London: The incumbent’s advantage?', 'Ido Segev: Exactly. So what is the attacker’s advantage is the agility. The attacker’s advantage would be the entrepreneurship, basically, drive. You know, the attacker’s advantage would be, you know, “I’m not going to take no for an answer.” The attacker’s advantage would be “I’m not tied to any legacy systems that are, actually, (a) represent big fixed cost that I need to deal with, and (b) just, like, will constrain me from, you know, what I can and what I want from what I can do.” So the question is, How do you actually leverage the competitive advantage that you have, the incumbent advantage, while bringing a culture of agility, a culture of innovation, and marrying the two?', 'Simon London: Yeah.', 'Ido Segev: And what I advise to my clients, you know, to do is a couple of things. I say, “This starts from the top, and it can’t be buried,” right? So we talked about that, because if it’s a priority for the CEO, they will make sure that they deliver the right level of engagement, that they prevent, you know, the rest from, you know, the—too much engagement.', 'The second thing is, like, how do you bring new types of skills and talent to the organization? I think the third thing that I advise my clients to do is basically try to set the governance in a way—we talked about it earlier—in a way that looks like, you know, how a VC would work with a start-up, right? So it impacts the frequency of meeting. It impacts, you know, the type of people that you put on the board, you know, to work with the start-up.', 'And then the fourth thing is, as a CEO, you need to work and be very attuned to the head of the whatever, like the venture, and take feedback that they have.', 'Simon London: Yeah, yeah.', 'Ido Segev: Be ready for them to say, “Look, you know, you are not letting me go as fast as I can. You are—you know, the procurement organization is not letting me onboard basically vendors that I just need for the success of this.”', 'Simon London: Right, because I’m getting resistance. C-minus-two or C-minus-one level or something? The CEO needs to know?', 'Ido Segev: Exactly. And then escalate those quickly and solve them, right? You know, I think if you—at the beginning, there’s going to be so much of those tactical but yet really important, you know, challenges. Allow the head of the new venture to escalate that and then act on it. And if you act on it quickly, I think the belief that you can move faster, you know, will grow exponentially. What do you think?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: The simple philosophy behind it is that if you’re creating something new, you have to wait till it grows up to stand on its own feet before you release it and fully unleash it to the rest of the organization.', 'And the reality is that you’ve got new talent coming in. These are—ideas are more nascent. Often the needs that you’re solving, by definition, are new market opportunities that will take a longer period to test. So you’re going to cause organ rejection if you release it to the parent too quickly. At the same time, if you leave it separate for too long, you’re going to create organ rejection at a later point, where this thing has become too large and starts competing for interests, relative to the parent.', 'Other businesses—you may realize at a certain point that you’ve gotten to a sufficient stand-alone business, but the new ideas you’ve come up with are much better as add-ons to existing service lines, and putting them in the hands of your sales force or digital distribution channels is really valuable.', 'So you’ve got to take them and merge them with the right aspects of the parent at the right point.', 'Ido Segev: I also think that to the extent you have a view of five years out what you’d want to do with this, is it basically—is the new business basically a Trojan horse to then roll in the old business to the new business? If you have the foresight or some view initially of where you want to take this, it might actually impact decisions that you make around how to build this and how to set the governance.', 'Simon London: The other attacker’s advantage that people talk about, and this was the—well, Clayton Christensen sadly has just passed away—but one of the Clayton Christensen insights, as I understand it, was the return profile on the capital is going to be very different. Even the profit margin of what the new venture is doing is going to be very different.', 'And this is one of the reasons why historically, you know, big companies have struggled with what Professor Christensen called the “disruptive innovation”—sort of lower-margin kind of disruptors coming in from below. And a big company will say, “Oh, that’s low-margin business. I don’t want to deal with that. Look, I’ve got all this great high-margin business.”', 'So presumably—like, we’ve touched on this, but the financial metrics, how you’re measuring success of this new venture—certainly be clear about this is not standard capex?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: That’s exactly right. I think there are two important things to keep in mind on that, right? One is you’ve got to look at what the margin profile would be of the business, once it is successful and operating, and not what the margin profile of the business is likely going to be over the first one or two years that you’re setting it up.', 'And then you have to look at that stand-alone economics of the business a couple of years out to say, “Is that structurally more attractive, potentially, than our core business?” And in many industries, if you reinvent the business model and you go from—you know, take the simple example of banking. You go from having banking branches to actually having a model that is predominantly without branches. You’ve structurally reduced a bunch of costs that you weren’t incurring. So if you can get that right, you will have a fundamentally lower cost in operating model in the future state, once you’ve got scale. You can’t evaluate the margin along the way, because the margin’s actually going to look a lot worse. So particularly in capital-intensive industries, where you’ve got a large installed base and infrastructure, it’s very hard to envision what that margin is going to look like.', 'But often you can get to a new ways of delivering it. And if you take the attacker and disrupter mentality, the start-up doesn’t have any of those assets, so they’re trying to be as nimble and as scrappy and as smart as they can in an asset-light way. And the same way Airbnb created one of the largest hotel chains in the world without actually having any hotel rooms, you start to create and think about how you solve customer needs without creating the same and replicating the same cost base, right?', 'The second important point is you have to have strict guardrails around what stage gates need to be crossed and is it working or not. The biggest fallacy in large corporations is once you’ve started something, there is a huge bias to continuing it and talking about how it’s working and pointing to different metrics over time.', 'Simon London: The sunk-cost fallacy?', 'Ido Segev: Uh-huh.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: That’s right. And if you’re a start-up, if you are not generating cash or if you’re not generating very strong leading indicators of what will drive cash, whether it’s users or revenue per user, you’re not going to get funded when you’re in the next round, right?', 'And you have to have the same mentality of not changing the metrics that you’re measuring as you’re going along to prove that this is successful, and only funding and continuing to fund it if you truly believe it’s on that trajectory and margin profile.', 'We often construct a reverse P&L with the key assumptions as we get started on these initiatives, because you have to know which assumptions you have to prove and derisk along the way, so you can get to that margin profile that you need.', 'Simon London: This is very nerdy, but I’m going to ask you to double-click on reverse P&L—just explain it.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: Reverse P&L is constructing a P&L for the business, perform a P&L for the business, so you can construct a clearer view on what the valuation of that new entity would be, and then backing into what core assumptions need to be true in order for that P&L to come true, both on the revenue side—', 'Simon London: So would this be looking sort of three or five years out? Going that far? Or just sort of next year?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: It’s going ten years out but then backing into a more deliberate view on the first five years and what key assumptions you need, both in terms of users, how much money you’re making off of each customer or user, whether you’ve got the right ramp and you’ve got the right acceleration on it, and whether you’ve got the right cost structure.', 'Simon London: Gotcha.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: It’s very hard to predict all of these things as you’re going along the way, so you have to make sure that you’re testing assumptions along the way. And if those assumptions change early on and you realize that you need more service intensity or you need more customer support stuff, you have to factor that into your P&L and think about how much money you expected the business to make, versus what it’s actually making.', 'Ido Segev: You asked a question around the financial profile, the economic profile of those ventures. And I think Vaibhav, you know, mentioned many of them are very fixed-cost intensive. You know, the way you make money on fixed-cost-intensive ventures is by scale.', 'And that actually means once you build the product, you need to be ready to actually, like, drive the hell out of it and, you know, do the marketing. And one of the things that I find—so some of my clients, you know—some organizations actually don’t do well is they’re not hitting the pedal to the metal.', 'Simon London: Right.', 'Ido Segev: You need to be ready to drive the market, and you need to be comfortable with the marketing expense associated with scaling those businesses, because without it, it will never scale. And for many organizations who are not as used to, you know, driving marketing at that scale, you know, they see the marketing budget and they say, “Well, this is a bit scary.”', 'Simon London: “Oh, we’ll cut that in half”?', 'Ido Segev: Exactly. But then it’s a self-fulfilling, prophecy, right? So you don’t spend on scaling this. It won’t scale. And then it just dies.', 'Simon London: Yeah, yeah. Can we just talk a little bit more about talent? We’ve mentioned it a couple of times along the way here, but what does an ideal business-building team look like?', 'Ido Segev: I think first of all you need, you know, those intrapreneurs—so people who build businesses, people who build businesses, people who will not take no for an answer, people who when, you know, the problem gets tough, that energizes them and [they] say, “Ah, I’m going to figure out how to, you know, solve this.”', 'I think the second thing is you need people who understand customers, you know, that can understand what does the customer need, what is a customer pain point. You know, they have the empathy toward the customer. And they actually use the customer-centric design as a framework for problem solving and building product. You know, it’s not, you know, people necessarily who know what’s the product P&L and therefore what would be most profitable for that. So that’s, you know, I think the second thing.', 'The third piece is you need engineers. And you need top-notch engineers who, by the way, if they are entrepreneurial and they have the customer empathy, that’s even better.', 'Simon London: By which we mean software engineers?', 'Ido Segev: Yeah. I think it’s tough, you know, to find, you know, the two first talent categories that I mentioned, but software engineers in this day and age—the competition for that is very, very, very tough.', 'And you know, the—you want the people who otherwise would go to Google or to Facebook, to— you know, you want them to build your products, so that would be either the third category that you need on the team.', 'And then I think it—to the point we talked about earlier, it can’t just be these guys, right? Because they don’t have with them any of the parent or the incumbent advantage, you know, with them. So you know, these guys need to be supplemented with some, you know, people from the parent company—people who bring whatever, like the risk mindset if you’re building a bank, or people from procurement, or people from legal. You know, you name it.', 'Simon London: And presumably, there’s something around just knowing how to get things done in the parent company as well? I mean, that’s an art in itself in a big organization—just to know who to talk to, to unlock a certain asset, to take advantage of these competitive advantages, as you say.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: Yeah, that’s exactly right. I think pairing the new venture with a set of folks from the parent organization who know how to get things done in the parent is really critical. And ideally, you want to embed some of these folks early on into the management team of the new venture.', 'It’s one of the hardest challenges you’re going to have as you’re building this out is tapping into the right people networks and a lot of domain knowledge and expertise, which may not be explicit but is implicit. So knowing who those savvy operators are and placing them onto the management team of the new venture early on is critically important.', 'Ido Segev: I’ll give you an example that sounds mundane, but it’s critical. So with one of my bank clients that built a new venture, you know, early on, there were a lot of third parties that needed to be onboarded—new system, new marketing solutions—you know, you name it. And if you know anything about banking, you know that onboarding new vendors is a long, long process.', 'Simon London: Yes.', 'Ido Segev: You know, it could take three, six, you know, months—you know, time sometimes—', 'Simon London: Yeah, and legitimately. I mean, there’s compliance reasons—', 'Ido Segev: Yeah, of course. But what they did in that situation, they said, “Okay, we are now going to have, you know, somebody or someone from third-party risk, you know, sit in this venture and get it done.” And get it done in five weeks, right, because you can’t do it in five days. You have to have—to your point on compliance, but get it done. I think that is the kind of mindset that you need to do.', 'Simon London: Get it done?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: I think the important thing, which is the crux of the talent question, is you have to solve for great intrinsics versus solving for great résumés. And what underlies the best people in these environments are ones who will have creativity and vision, because they’ll come in with ideas and they’re not looking for direction or the path to be laid out for them. Often people who’ve got great résumés but worked in large organizations but weren’t actually the ones coming up with the ideas, they were taking other people’s ideas and executing them—they find it hard in these environments, because it’s not as clear what you need to do. So you have to have that creativity and vision. You have to have agility and the ability to be okay with ambiguity, be okay with change.', 'And the third is ambition and hunger, right? This is not a nine-to-five, nine-to-six job. The best people are going to be ones that are willing to really be switched on 24/7, thinking about where they could take this venture. That’s the hardest one, because often you can’t create the same incentive structures that you have in pure start-ups. So you have to have people who have that desire and ambition and hunger but to do something and to drive change and impact, versus it being purely monetary or financial returns.', 'Simon London: I’m going to be devil’s advocate here, because that’s just—when you mentioned financial incentives, that’s just where I was coming to. Like, is it really realistic to expect XYZ healthcare company or XYZ insurance or bank to attract the caliber of people who would go to, you know, the latest hot Silicon Valley company, whether big or small, just because there’s not going to be the kind of stock options available? You’re not going to be sort of immersed in that same culture of start-up-ness or hot tech that you are. So is it realistic, and you know, what do you advise clients? What can and should they do to try and make it happen?', 'Vaibhav Gujral: I think it absolutely is. I think to assume that everyone who is ambitious and creative and wants to see change in the world wants to work in a 10 or 20 percent start-up or a tech company is a narrow view, right, of the world. There are a whole lot of incredibly talented, ambitious people who want to drive change and leverage platforms that many of these larger organizations have, that from the outset derisk, right?', 'And we talked earlier about improving the odds of success where you’re going in. You know you have assets and capabilities that give you a huge head start, in terms of driving change in the world. So two years in, you could be running a new company that has changed a sector.', 'Simon London: So you have to persuade them again that “our odds of doing something very cool here are pretty high”?', 'Ido Segev: Yeah.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: We are incredibly uniquely positioned to do something different and drive impact and change much faster. And if you have that conviction, you can attract great talent that has the right hybrid, right? But you have to appeal to a motivation that is different than the person who’s solving purely for the stock options.', 'Ido Segev: I think there’s talent out there who has appetite to disrupt, you know, any industry, right? So no industry is boring; let’s just put it this way. So it’s now a matter of how do you make sure that they come to you versus, you know, do it on their own or do it with someone else.', 'Simon London: So what are the common failure modes, is probably the best way of putting it? When you look at big business-building initiatives that fail, what are some of the common things that we see that could have been avoided? I mean, Ido, how would you answer that?', 'Ido Segev: Well, you know, there are a couple that come to mind. The first is around expectation. And so, you know, I think this is expecting the new venture to be ROI-positive in the first quarter of its existence. It sounds banal, but it’s very, very common that there’s a lot of pressure to show standard ROI metrics very quickly.', 'The second I would say is around what I would call “cultural contamination.” So this is building a new business but having a lot of the parent culture basically creep into the new venture and disable it from moving fast—from, you know, thinking differently, you know, et cetera.', 'The third is killing it with bureaucracy. What do I mean by that? Two examples. You as a new venture would probably need to hire people very, very quickly. The standard hiring processes of many incumbents are very, very slow. If you tell, you know, a new venture, “Hey, you need to adhere to existing processes,” they won’t be able to hire, you know, quickly enough. Another common example of killing it with bureaucracy would be onboarding new vendors that, you know, are critical for the success of this.', 'And then the last one that I would think—that I could think—about is not scaling quickly enough. I think we talked about the fact that the economics of a new venture like that, particularly digital ones, are very fixed-cost heavy. And the way to actually make it work is by scaling.', 'The economics of a new venture, particularly digital ones, are very fixed-cost heavy. And the way to actually make it work is by scaling.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: I think the scaling point is a critical one, because if you don’t have a clear view right from the outset on what is the thing that you were testing and, once that has worked, where you can take it, then—and you’re figuring that out after the first stage of the process—you’re never going to get the return profile that you would expect as a true start-up-type venture. You have to be ready to hit the pedal hard and go into hyperscaling mode, once you figure out it works, because not only are you leaving dollars on the table, chances are you’ve proven the idea for five other people, and you’re going to—', 'Ido Segev: Yeah, and they’re trying competition. So if you’re actually not scaling faster than others in creating a mode for yourself and leveraging that first advantage that you have, it’s a missed opportunity.', 'Simon London: So it sounds almost like there are a couple of leaps of faith? And this is probably true of, you know, whether it’s an entrepreneurial start-up or a, you know, business built within a big company. First you have to have the leap of faith to say, “We’re going to do this. We don’t know exactly where it’s going to go, but we’re going to do this. We’re going to do it at scale. We’re going to take it seriously.”', 'Vaibhav Gujral: That’s exactly right. You have to create a catalyst for change. And you have to have a leap of faith that it’s pointing the direction of the company forward. And that is a real leap of faith and often is not going to come from looking at quarterly market indicators, and it’s not going to come from looking at what’s going on in other industries. It’s going to come from looking at disruptions, and it’s going to come from imagining what the future could be.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: You have to take a leap of faith that the capital investment, management attention, time, et cetera, is worthwhile, because the return profile for the first one or two years, as we’ve discussed, is going to be different. You have to have a leap of faith that if you’re taking a medium-term horizon on the business, not only are you going to make the business much stronger from a growth and economics perspective, but also position yourself in—future-proof yourself against—potential disruption and what competitors might do.', 'Simon London: Vaibhav and Ido, thank you for making the time. That was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. So thank you.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: Thank you, Simon.', 'Ido Segev: Yeah, thank you.', 'Vaibhav Gujral: My pleasure.', 'Vaibhav Gujral is a partner in McKinsey’s New York office, and Ido Segev is a partner in the Boston office.

Here’s how—and  what to do about it.,"['The newest consumer generations—Gen Z and millennials—are upturning retailers’ expectations. Here’s how—and  what to do about it.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Lucia Rahilly speaks with McKinsey partner Bo Finneman and associate partner Emma Spagnuolo about how Gen Z and millennials are influencing the future of shopping. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Lucia Rahilly, and I sat in to host today’s episode on the new age of the consumer: Generation Z and millennials. We recorded this podcast just before the outbreak of COVID-19 that has unexpectedly shuttered stores across the globe. But as retailers begin cautiously to reopen, the questions we discussed return to the fore: How does Generation Z differ from the millennial generation? And how are they reshaping the way that we shop, buy food, and do business? We’ll find out more with Bo Finneman, a partner in our Miami office, and Emma Spagnuolo, an associate partner in our New Jersey office.', 'Bo, Emma, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for taking the time today.', 'Emma Spagnuolo: Thank you so much for having me.', 'Bo Finneman: It’s great to be here.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Great to have you. Before we get started, let’s define terms. Emma, who are Generation Z? When were they born? How old are they?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: Gen Z is our latest generation. It’s not super clear today where they end; it hasn’t been defined. But they started out in 1996, and they’re up to 24 years old. When you think about millennials, you’re looking more at a 20- to a 40-year-old, so roughly 1980 to 2000.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And what’s the importance of Gen Z as a demographic? How big a cohort do they represent, and what’s at stake for the brands which are looking at them as they emerge over the coming years as consumers?', 'Bo Finneman: Great question. I think from a Generation Z point of view—although as a population, they won’t peak for another ten years—we’re really looking at them as the core influencers today that have a really big impact on both millennials and Gen Xers in terms of what they buy. In size, they will definitely reach scale in the next  ten to 15 years, but it’s about their influence today—that’s what’s so important.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And how do they have influence on Gen Xers?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: So I think it goes both ways, actually. On the one hand, you have Gen Z needing to influence their parents in order to get what they want. But on the other hand, if you look at the influence behaviors of Gen X, they’re much more likely to be influenced by the people sitting at the dinner table. So as they listen to their kids talk to them, they’re being influenced about what they want to buy for themselves.', 'Lucia Rahilly: It’s so interesting, because I was visiting my in-laws over Thanksgiving, and there were multiple generations at the table. And I have to say, the teens, the moms, and the grandparents were all sort of dressed alike. It seems that there’s no longer that division in generational approach to clothing that there used to be 25 years ago or whatnot.', 'So in order for brands to understand whether they’re tapping into Gen Z’s wants and values, we need to understand a little more about what those needs and wants and values are. When we think about Gen Z, what are some of the characteristics that come up? How is this younger generation typically described?', 'Bo Finneman: I think the way in which it’s described is not always in the most positive of terms. So you may actually have some things come out from executives saying, “Are they entitled? Or are they a bit elitist in terms of their beliefs and their perspectives or their demands on brands?”', 'But I think there’s a real authenticity to the Gen Z generation in saying they want to breathe new life into what corporate responsibility looks like. And one of the biggest elements that’s come out of the research in the last few years has been the focus on values. They’re looking beyond tangible products and actually trying to understand what is it that makes the company tick. What’s its mission? What’s its purpose? And what is it actually trying to build for us as a society? And to me, it’s that lifeblood of thought that’s been quite compelling for them.', 'They’re looking beyond tangible products and actually trying to understand what is it that makes the company tick. What’s its mission? What’s its purpose? And what is it actually trying to build for us as a society?', 'Lucia Rahilly: Do you see that same shift happening with millennials? Is that common across both cohorts?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: Yes. What we see is an acceleration. These are trends that started for sure with millennials over the last couple of years. And now what we see is, as Gen Zs are coming up, they’re pushing it even further and accelerating a lot of these trends.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And so how is that emphasis on values and sustainability—how does that relate to value as a priority? Are Gen Zs, in other words, willing to pay a premium for sustainable goods with a story that makes them feel guiltless about consumption and so forth?', 'Bo Finneman: There’s a real shift in the generations in terms of how you even think about value delivery to a customer. Before, it was pretty easy. You could almost think about it as what does the overall price look like and the quality of the item and what’s the trade-off I’m making?', 'And now that simplistic lens—we’ve actually seen it really diminish. And when you look across generations, it’s very significant in terms of the folks that say, “I make a decision based on pure value or lower cost.” And now that equation of how we even evaluate what something is worth is so much more multidimensional. To your point, it goes to societal values, it goes to status, it goes to social influence, et cetera. That dimension has become far more important than what it was before.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How does Gen Z feel about luxury?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: So it’s interesting, Gen Z is definitely willing to spend on luxury, which is different than what you hear a lot of times out in the press. The difference is that Gen Z doesn’t think of luxury as a name brand that they want to slap onto their bag or their shirt and wear as a badge. They’re really looking for unique items that set them apart.', 'And this is a place where millennials and Gen Z diverge. Whereas a millennial is looking more for that kind of showcaser status—“Look at me wearing this brand item”—a Gen Z is looking more for this item that shows that they’re different, they’re unique. And if they find it from a luxury brand, then they’re absolutely willing to pay for it.', 'Lucia Rahilly: To what do you attribute that shift in mindset from exclusivity to uniqueness?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: I think part of it is just the world that we’re living in today. They’re growing up in times where things can be difficult, both from a geopolitical and a climate perspective.', 'There’s a lot of contradictory things they’re hearing out there, and so trust is kind of difficult for them. They don’t want to fit in with a certain crowd or be labeled a certain way. They want to be themselves, and that’s where they find their security.', 'Bo Finneman: The piece I would add, too, is it feels to me like the convergence of generational mindsets, where you have Gen Z saying, “I like the aspect of being an individual. I like the aspect of having true thoughts of my own.” And we see in the marketing where Gen Zs will say, “I’m not interested in what the brand is saying about itself. I’m interested in coming up with my own perceptions based on all these sorts of sources.”', 'And the other thing that ties in is that the overall ecosystem in which Gen Zs are buying is fundamentally different. And maybe three quick sources. One is that niche brands are popping up more than ever. Second is the way in which you can buy them is becoming more and more available and distributed. And the third is the overall importance and scale of social media as a platform to showcase yourself has grown. And it’s been really fascinating to see the convergence of those creating a bit of a perfect storm for these types of situations to come to life.', 'Lucia Rahilly: How do Gen Zs look at the phone? How much are they using their phones? Are they using their phones to shop more than previous generations?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: So there are two points to this answer. First of all, yes, they’re absolutely using their phones to shop more than prior generations. However, they don’t think of it as this external, new, exciting thing that they can use, the way that a lot of millennials and some Gen X may think about it. Instead, it’s a tool they’ve always had.', 'So they don’t think about shopping in this binary way: if I want to buy item X, I must go to the department store, and if I want to buy item Y, I must go to the grocery store. They shop across all types of formats. So they’re looking at pop-up boutiques, they’re shopping on Instagram. Then they’re going into the department store. Then they’re going into the specialty store. Then they’re going online on their laptop. They’re not thinking, “This is the place I need to go.” They’re experiencing these brands every step of the way, at every moment, and their phone is just one super important tool for them to do that.', 'Bo Finneman: I remember even five years ago, when we would work with chief marketing officers, the concept was your overall annual plan and your major campaigns and what you were going to release across a multitude of media channels. And now it’s such a more complicated, dynamic world. I think to be a chief marketing officer, you suddenly wake up and have the realization that you need to be a part of a conversation and that you’re part of the social fabric. You’re no longer the core orchestrator of the dialogue. You’re purely one other voice in it.', 'That’s a more complicated world to be in. It certainly is a massive amount of change in terms of both how you approach it day to day and the capabilities you need to have. But the most successful brands we see today have used that to their advantage, versus feeling as though it’s a risk or something they have to try to minimize.', 'Emma Spagnuolo: It’s like building a community. I think you can see it even in the rapid way influencer marketing has shifted over the last few years. So even two, three years ago, brands were talking about how they need to now have their Instagram and their YouTube influencers: “This is where my customer is, and this is how I need to reach them.”', 'It has now taken on the life of the celebrity, where these are players who are less trusted by the Gen Z population. So now, instead of needing to have one major influencer—where you could shift your marketing money from a magazine to this influencer—now you have to cultivate this community of micro-influencers who each talk to 30,000 people, no more, and are creating a collaborative discussion or dialogue, to Bo’s point, around your brand and what it stands for. And you need to guide that.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And are those formal brand influencers, or are those informal evangelists, fans, and so forth? Brand loyalists?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: It can go both ways. It often starts as the latter, and then you end up striking up a relationship with that person. The brand often reaches out to that person and says, “Hey, it looks like you love my brand.” They go from there.', 'Bo Finneman: I think this is an interesting shift when you think about it in terms of pictures in your mind. For a boomer, the concept was television as a family and seeing what advertisements would come out. And there was a degree of excitement around that. And you really felt as though you were learning something about innovation and what was being offered.', 'You go then to Gen Xers, who suddenly start to realize word of mouth. And there’s a combination of what I hear on television but also what my friends and family tell me at the dinner table. Then you go to millennials, who for the first time have social-media platforms where you now have access to what your friends and family are saying, even if they’re not at the dining table every night.', 'And now you have Gen Zs, who are saying, “I can take the concept of social media, but I can now filter. So I can listen to my friends and family when I feel like they’re credible on the topic, but I also have means by which I can access influencers and experts that have points of view in this space that might align with mine.”', 'And it’s been that snapshot over time that’s created such a different change in how you, as a brand, need to think about communicating and actually working with customers so that they understand who and what you are.', 'Lucia Rahilly: So it sounds like brands’ access to consumers gets refracted through a kind of prism. And does that shift emphasis to brand story, for example, and the way that brands can create a coherent narrative about themselves, versus specific advertising campaigns, et cetera?', 'Bo Finneman: I think that’s absolutely right. And in the context of today’s marketing world, where it’s easy to get lost in data and analytics at your fingertips, I don’t think we can forget the core essence of how marketing was initially built up.', 'It’s the concept of emotional connection, which we know is differentiating and sustainable over time, along with the ability to communicate that in a manner that resonates with customers, that feels authentic. And the need for that in our world today—when you look at some of the facts in terms of the amount of media at our fingertips and in front of our eyes, whether it’s the number of emails, the number of social-media stories that you see, to break through the clutter requires emotional connection and quality storytelling, for sure.', 'Emma Spagnuolo: It’s really the only way that you can maintain your brand’s positioning and your brand’s perspective, because if you have anything that’s not authentic within your brand story, it’s going to be exposed immediately. Just the way that people are rapidly consuming this information, they’re finding things. And we talk about “cancel culture”: the second something doesn’t match with what you’re saying, you’re going to be skewered for it.', 'So it’s really important, as we move beyond being omnichannel and more to this concept of being omnipresent, that brands are really keeping within their story and making sure that they are true to it and authentic. You can’t talk about sustainability if you’re not doing sustainable practices. Things that in the past you could hide by selecting and choosing what you wanted to show to the public—today everything is fair game.', 'Bo Finneman: To build on the point, there is an authentic spirit to Gen Z individuals where I think they just really want to know and understand who they’re buying from. I would describe them as tremendously discerning and disciplined.', 'Some of us in other generations would spend money and not necessarily ask ourselves the question “Do I want my $20 purchase to go toward this company?” I’m not a Gen Z, but I could learn from that degree of value to say, “If I’m going to spend money, big or small, I want to make sure it’s going toward something I believe in. And in addition, if I’m going to be presenting it as attached to myself, I want to feel even more pride that it’s something that I am connected to.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Yes, there’s that concept of eco-indulgence, too. When I think of my own kids, if they came to me and told me that they wanted to buy from a brand that engages in sustainable and local practices and so forth, I would probably be likelier to support that and give them the dough for it.', 'Bo Finneman: I do think that’s why we see the degree of willingness to pay that we see among these individuals. When there’s a greater degree of thinking and discipline behind purchases, it seems to also open the aperture to say, “I’ll pick up my wallet and spend it because I’m spending it on something I believe in.”', 'I don’t want to make light of prior generations, but with millennials, boomers, or Gen Xers, I think there was a degree of “I make purchases that are more routine and habitual, and I’m not necessarily analyzing them deeply,” versus Gen Z having a unique twist and really thinking about what they spend on.', 'If you’re an established luxury brand, what does this mean for you? I think we have consistently seen across this research and our consumer-decision-journey research that loyalty is elusive; it’s almost by the wayside. We see it in our segmentation. The concept of “I buy the same brand because I bought it last time and I’m sort of happy”—that just doesn’t work. The inertia is not as strong.', 'And there’s something about winning every purchase. There are different reasons you’re going to win it, but I think there’s a need to get under the concept of winning every purchase and finding a degree of innovation or newness—or something by which you can compel someone to buy you again—that every brand is facing, almost regardless of how strong you’ve been in the past. Resting on your laurels is certainly not an option in today’s world.', 'Lucia Rahilly: So that emphasis on variety—I think in part what you’re saying is it creates an opportunity for new brands as well. We see these new and smaller brands cropping up. Obviously, new brands can crop up in part because it’s not as capital intensive to start a clothing company as it was when we were purely brick and mortar. But does that also create an opportunity for these smaller brands to enter the market and broaden the brand variety that consumers are looking for, if they’re looking to stand out?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: Absolutely. If you look at the cosmetics market today, that’s where we’re seeing all the growth. It’s in these smaller brands that—whether or not they’re backed by an influencer or an incubator or a celebrity—are finding a way to get online, because it’s not capital intensive. They don’t need to find a way into a large distribution network. And now they offer something new just by being a new brand. So a consumer is going to continue to buy all these different items simply because they want to try and test and see and feel, and it’s exciting and innovative to them.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Is Gen Z expressing a preference, then, for smaller versus larger brands? Are you seeing growth in that space?', 'Bo Finneman: Yes. One of the elements we considered was is it just the degree of newness or excitement around new? We looked at the data, and what we found is that small brands are by far outpacing in terms of their share of growth across consumer categories. When we compare small versus large, it’s a substantial differential in terms of small brands really being able to grow way above their share.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve talked a lot about sustainability and the value that Gen Z places on sustainability. How are you seeing that reflected in the research?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: It’s super interesting. Actually, I think we need to take a step back first and think a little bit about millennials. When we look at millennials over time—so when we started this effort in 2016, versus today, in 2019—a large majority of their attitudes started to temper as they got older and achieved new milestones in life.', 'The one that did not—that got significantly stronger—was sustainability. This is the one area millennials are even more convinced that they care about than they were in 2016. So this is not going to be a fleeting flavor-of-the-year kind of trend. This is something that is simmering and growing and is going to continue to go on as one of the only values they care even more about since 2016.', 'Of course, when you look at Gen Z, they care about sustainability even more than millennials. But it’s very interesting to see that millennials care even more so than they did in 2016, so that when you compare them to Gen Z, this is a trend that will continue to move forward.', 'Lucia Rahilly: I’m wondering if Gen Z is focused on wellness and how that might affect products like food and grocery. How is food shopping changing, and how does wellness affect that?', 'Bo Finneman: I think there are two parts to it: there’s both what are they buying and then where are they buying. In terms of what they’re buying, a lot of what we test for is, is this a buzz term, an excitement trend? Or are there real dollars being put behind it by consumers in terms of demand?', 'And I do think that the explosion of niche diets and the aspiration to have real understanding of the supply chain of your food is continuing to grow. You see that in niche diets, whether it’s vegetarianism, veganism, keto, paleo, you name it. Those are becoming sizable enough that folks are having to actually build offerings around them. That, I think, will continue.', 'The other shift that’s potentially even stronger is where younger generations are willing to buy their food. And this is where we’re seeing a real shift out of traditional channels and a real explosion into some of the other areas—online-only grocery as an example, taking real share from traditional grocery, going into some of the specialty suppliers as well.', 'Emma Spagnuolo: It’s actually so significant that today roughly 35 percent of Gen Zs say that they’re shopping somewhere that’s not either a traditional grocery store, a mass store, a club store, or a grocery store, compared with other generations.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Emma, you referred to Gen Z shifting toward brick and mortar on clothes shopping, whereas millennials have moved much more toward online only. Say more.', 'Emma Spagnuolo: It’s very true, actually. You see Gen Z shopping across all formats. I think what it really gets back to is that millennials were given online shopping as this new, fun, exciting, convenient tool. During the course of their lifetime, they went to the department store with their parents, and now they’re able to go online and shop.', 'And for them, that’s not only fun but also convenient. And when you think about the life stage that they’re in right now—buying homes, moving to the suburbs, having kids—this need for convenience matched with this excitement around this being a new tool for them has really made online shopping exclusively a big thing for them.', 'Gen Zs, on the other hand—they want to shop across both types of channels all the time. So they might go online while they’re at school, look at something there, then decide they want to go to the store for fun, enjoy the experience. They see something; they haven’t made a purchase yet. They get home; suddenly they see an Instagram ad for their new favorite beauty brand, and they hit “shop now,” and they purchase through Instagram. But that shopping journey touched on brick and mortar, it touched on e-commerce online on their laptop, and it touched on mobile. It’s a holistic experience.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Do you think that’s more about the seamless integration of mobile into their lives, or do you think it’s traditional retail therapy? Is it addressing their need for social interaction? What forces do you attribute the shift to brick and mortar to?', 'Bo Finneman: One is that there’s a new and more profound resurgence of the experience of retail and in-store. The number of clients we talk with and the number of tactics they’re deploying to make brick-and-mortar experiences better have definitely gone up.', 'There’s a second piece, too, which is just the overall frequency of shopping we’re seeing among younger generations. The concept is no longer once a week or once a month or once a quarter I’m going think about this purchase. They’re almost always-on purchasers. And you can imagine it, that when they get triggered—whether it’s through social media or something else—they’ve also been primed to know that they can go make very small-ticket purchases at any point in time, and that’s become OK. So I think there’s a frequency aspect to it that has opened the aperture for online and brick and mortar.', 'And then maybe the last one is the degree of community and social nature that can happen in meeting spots. We’re starting to see this in communities.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Are you finding that they prefer curated, multibrand outlets? Or are they looking at small, single-brand shops more?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: What we see in the data is that they’re pretty agnostic toward that. They’re shopping each of those as frequently as the other, and they’re shopping all of them more frequently than other generations. So it’s really about “If I see something I like from this brand and I go into this store, I’m interested in their curated assortment, and I’m also really interested in the experience that that brand is going to give me.”', 'But you can have a brand that’s a company creating product and selling under its brand name, and you can also have a brand that’s a retailer that has created this curated experience. And so that brand is more of the experience and the types of products I see, versus the name that’s on the tag. You can have experience and brand in both formats.', 'Bo Finneman: The other piece to add on from a business standpoint, when you think about this dynamic, is that both lenses bring new challenges and difficulties. So if you are a multibrand retailer, it’s all about making sure you’re actually on trend with the assortment and that you’re willing to switch it up enough to keep it new, and that you’re always going to be on the forefront.', 'And there’s an aspect of “What are you adding to my shopping experience? Why should I buy from you? Is it expertise? Is there something unique in-store? How are you using technology?” On the other end of the spectrum, you see more specialty plays where they’re only displaying their own brand in-store, at which point you have to say, “I really need to stay on top from a product-innovation standpoint in what I’m building to keep reasons for people to come in.”', 'And interestingly, part of what we’ve also seen is the blurring of the lines between the two and really having to think “If someone has an opportunity—30 minutes or an hour of free time—how do we ensure we’re top of mind in terms of being the place they want to come for both browsing and, ideally, purchasing?”', 'Lucia Rahilly: We know that Gen Z is a diverse cohort. How do they break down in terms of archetypes? There must be some categories of consumer that we use to look at them.', 'Emma Spagnuolo: We’ve run a segmentation on Gen Z in isolation from the rest of the population. And when you do that, they actually break down into the same seven segments that we see in the total population as well. We like to think of these segments within three clusters that are all driven by a single value.', 'We’ve run a segmentation on Gen Z in isolation from the rest of the population. And when you do that, they actually break down into the same seven segments that we see in the total population as well.', 'First, we have our value customers, who are really thinking about what they’re getting for their money and are much more price sensitive.', 'Second, we have our quality customers. They’re really looking for the top-quality item they can get and making sure their purchases will fit exactly what they need and are willing to spend.', 'And then, finally, one of the more interesting groups we have is the image cluster. And in these three segments, it’s very important to them how they’re expressing themselves with their purchases. It doesn’t mean that they need to fit in. Some of them want to fit in and look like they’re showcasing their life to the world. But some of them are looking to be unique. It’s all about self-expression and the image they’re putting forward when they make purchases.', 'Bo Finneman: Just to add on that, I think this shift—if you just look at generations across a map and boomers and Gen X, we would have said this is the bank of the economy. These are the people that are spending day in and day out. Those individuals—a significant portion of them are price shoppers. And we’ve seen this for a decade in research—the folks that are saying, “What’s the value you deliver? I’m price sensitive. Let’s go for it.”', 'In millennials and in Gen Zs, we’re seeing that cohort shrink. It’s becoming a more multidimensional decision-making process. It’s no longer as simplistic as “That’s $2.99, and this is $3.25, hence I will buy that.” There’s an aspect of the simplistic lens of pure price and value that seems to be diminishing.', 'And the group that’s growing is more image focused. They have different desires: some want to be more on the forefront of trends, and some want to be trend followers. But there’s an aspect of that showcasing and ability to demonstrate who you are that’s becoming a much bigger portion of how people make decisions.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And how much is this about life stage, and how much do you think these trends will have durability ten years out, for example?', 'Emma Spagnuolo: When we look at the segmentation, this is not necessarily about life stage. What we see is that even some boomers have shifted into the image category. While it’s definitely true that the majority still remain in the other categories, the movement is into the image cluster. And the other thing we saw is the shift of millennials.', 'When you look at it, roughly 13 percent of people have shifted from being in the value cluster to being in the image cluster. This is not the newest generation making this most significant jump. So I think it’s definitely something that’s here to stay.', 'Bo Finneman: Just to emphasize that, part of why we’re so focused on longitudinal research is to try to uncover this. And when we look over three years, we don’t see that the trend is receding; we see that it’s accelerating. The shift out of what we call economizers or risk avoiders and into image—now millennials are looking more like Gen Zs. As we’ve started to discuss this even among our own groups, it’s hard to imagine this change isn’t here to stay.', 'The concepts of what is the value of the company, how do you contribute to the social fabric, how do you think about sustainability, how are you omnipresent, how are you bringing something new for me every time?—it’s almost hard to imagine that those are fleeting concepts that a couple of years from now will be completely new.', 'Lucia Rahilly: If there are a few things you’d like us to walk away with, what would they be?', 'Bo Finneman: To me, there’s one point, which is that we need to deeply understand the seismic shifts happening in the consumer base and what’s driving decision making, because it’s not marginal.', 'Second is really having the sobering moment to tell yourself, “I have to win the purchase every time.” The loyalist, the price plays—those are becoming less and less successful. And we have to really focus on how we engage consumers who have a new degree of demands—really be honest and hold the mirror up and say, “Am I delivering, or am I not?”', 'And third is then to say, tactically, “What am I willing to do differently?” And we see it from marketing—to say, “I have to figure out how to engage in a dialogue with consumers, all the way through purchasing,” when you say, “I’ve got to figure out how to make my store more exciting or how to compete in a marketplace that’s ever changing.”', 'Emma Spagnuolo: The only thing I would add is that you really can’t, as a brand, think about how I’m going to capture Gen Z or how I’m going to capture millennials. There’s a very diverse group of people within that. And there’s actually a way to target Gen Z through boomers, if that’s what you want to do, by looking at their needs and what they want out of their shopping experience.', 'You have to get away from all of the noise and conflicting messages you hear and really start to dig down into who your true consumer is and not just how am I going to blanket-target the Gen Z consumer.', 'You have to get away from all of the noise and conflicting messages you hear and really start to dig down into who your true consumer is and not just how am I going to blanket-target the Gen Z consumer.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Fantastic.

48,AI in healthcare: Microsoft’s Kevin Scott on how tech can treat a pandemic,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-in-healthcare-microsofts-kevin-scott-on-how-tech-can-treat-a-pandemic,Machine learning to develop vaccines faster; wearable devices to detect illness sooner: the COVID-19 pandemic could spark significant innovations in healthcare technologies.,"['Machine learning to develop vaccines faster; wearable devices to detect illness sooner: the COVID-19 pandemic could spark significant innovations in healthcare technologies.', 'Breakthroughs in biological science are combining with continuing advances in high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence (AI) technologies in a Bio Revolution. The power of AI has already been proven in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed and scale at which researchers launched efforts to develop a vaccine were remarkable, and that owed much to AI-powered R&D. But there is much more to come from AI in healthcare, with a growing role in predicting, preventing, and treating COVID-19 cases—and even preventing the next pandemic.', 'In May 2020, McKinsey Global Institute cochair and director James Manyika spoke with Microsoft chief technology officer (CTO) Kevin Scott about the vast potential of AI in healthcare and his views on the broad possibility of the Bio Revolution. An edited excerpt of their conversation follows.', 'James Manyika: I’m delighted today to be speaking with Kevin Scott, one of the leading technologists in the world. Kevin is the CTO and executive vice president of AI and research at Microsoft. Kevin has built and led technology teams at various places, starting at Google back in 2003, then at AdMob, back to Google, then at LinkedIn, and now at Microsoft.', 'Kevin’s quite well-known in the industry as one of the people who builds the largest, most capable technology platforms and systems. I’m grateful to be having a conversation with him. I should add that Kevin has just recently published a new book titled Reprogramming the American Dream: From Rural America to Silicon Valley—Making AI Serve Us All [Harper Business, April 2020]. Welcome, Kevin.', 'Kevin Scott: Thank you so much for having me, James.', 'James Manyika: I’m delighted to have you. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation for some time. I wanted to spend some time talking to you about what you’re working on right now. You’re building some of the largest, most complicated computer systems in the world, and much of that is being applied to AI systems. What are you most excited about right now in your work on AI?', 'Kevin Scott: We’ve been working on many things over the past couple of years. As you mentioned, [that includes] these very-large-scale computing platforms for training a new type of deep neural-network model. Some people called it “unsupervised,” but we have taken to calling them “self-supervised learning systems.”', 'I guess it’s just a coincidence, but before the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent the past handful of months focusing on the intersection between AI and the basic sciences. In particular, the intersection of AI and biology is really fascinating. We’re starting to do some foundational work there that is going to be useful for more than helping us resolve some of the challenges we’re facing right now with the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m hoping we’re going to see all sorts of fantastic, beneficial things happen after the COVID-19 crisis is over.', 'James Manyika: We are going through this extraordinary COVID-19 moment. You mentioned that one of the things you’re excited about is the application of AI to tackle these healthcare and COVID-19-related issues. Say more about that.', 'What are you seeing? How are you, your teams, and others applying AI to the COVID-19 crisis?', 'Kevin Scott: The thing that I would remind everyone of about machine learning and AI is that we should be thinking about them as tools that can be used fairly flexibly in a bunch of different ways. They’re not a thing in and of themselves.', 'If you look at how we’re using machine learning in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve deployed a bot-based technology. For instance, people who believe that they have COVID-19-like symptoms are able to self-triage those symptoms so that we can help manage precious testing and hospital resources. There are additional efforts we’re working on right now around enrolling people who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate their blood plasma that contains antibodies for COVID-19. Then we can dispense them to a consortium of companies that are working on refining that plasma into a therapy for COVID-19. AI is involved in the enrollment experience and figuring how to route the collected plasma to the right places.', 'One of the most sophisticated things that we’re doing with AI is using molecular simulations—trying to figure out how we could, in a simulation environment, discover therapeutic compounds and potential vaccines that we can use to treat the disease. Basically, machine-learning models could accelerate some of the exploration and simulation in this compound discovery.', 'One of the most sophisticated things that we’re doing with AI is using molecular simulations—trying to figure out how we could, in a simulation environment, discover therapeutic compounds and potential vaccines that we can use to treat the disease.', 'James Manyika: In other words, AI can have a remarkable impact as we search for vaccine targets because what AI could do in searching this huge space is beyond what we could do otherwise.', 'Kevin Scott: Yes, absolutely.', 'James Manyika: I’d love to hear you talk about this intersection between these AI techniques and the biological sciences. How big do you think this is?', 'Kevin Scott: I think it could be absolutely enormous. When you think about the set of events that led up to the industrialization process that happened right after World War II, it gave us our basic infrastructure that we have used to build most of modern Western society. I do see analogues to some of those conditions now with the COVID-19 pandemic. We are on a very accelerated pace, learning how important it is to make these investments. We’re going to see very exciting accomplishments in terms of where the biological sciences intersect with high-performance computing and AI.', 'I’m hoping we will take all of what we’re learning right now, and this sense of urgency that we feel, and transform that into action. It’s entirely conceivable to me that the next seven or eight decades of our existence as a human race might be defined by this set of technologies that are rooted in the biological sciences. And the accelerator, the spark that lights the innovation fire that hopefully happens, is this pandemic.', 'It’s entirely conceivable to me that the next seven or eight decades of our existence as a human race might be defined by this set of technologies that are rooted in the biological sciences.', 'James Manyika: In our own research, we found that some 60 percent of the inputs into our economy are either biological or could be created in a biologically influenced way. And that’s a major part of the economy. If the breakthroughs you’re talking about could transform all of that, it would be enormous.', 'Kevin Scott: It’s incredibly rich, too. You have the things that we’re already seeing right now, where AI plus biometric sensing is giving us powerful diagnostic capabilities. I don’t know whether we’ll get it in time to make a dent on the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s possible that you will have a smartwatch, a fitness band, a ring with biometric sensors, or another set of devices that are measuring your body temperature, your blood-oxygen-saturation levels, your movement, and your pulse rate. And the devices are putting the data into diagnostic models that could tell you when you are sick, or getting sick, way before you would ever notice. This would give us the ability to do medicine in a way that we can’t do it right now: if we could treat people when they are less gravely ill, their chance of recovery would be much higher, and it would be cheaper to intervene then than after someone is symptomatic or more seriously ill. It may be something that helps us manage the next pandemic.', 'It also means that you can think about democratizing access to high-quality healthcare in a way that you can’t right now, because it’s too expensive. That’s one end of the spectrum. Then you also have this incredible richness for what you’re going to be able to do in terms of synthetic biology: building and engineering DNA and RNA structures in our bodies so that we can design better medicines and therapies and maybe defeat some of these diseases that have been intractable for a long while—medical conditions that are resilient to our ability to treat them well.', 'On the other hand, you also have the biologists doing incredibly cool things. You can now reprogram yeast to brew a whole variety of organic compounds that you then can use in manufacturing and building products in ways that are substitutes for part of the petrochemical industry. That is super exciting as well.', 'James Manyika: Kevin, I want to thank you again so much for joining us.

Fast.","['Here’s how technology, data, and human insight are transforming the way we enact change. Fast.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partner Bill Schaninger and McKinsey partner Alexander DiLeonardo about organizational change. An edited transcript of their conversation follows.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Diane Brady: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast. I’m Diane Brady. If you’re like me, you’ve probably binge watched more than a few shows during quarantine, so you already know how streaming services collect data that helps them mysteriously recommend what to watch next. What if we could take those tools and techniques and apply them to organizations? Call it, “the personalization of change.” That’s what we’ll explore in this episode taped shortly before the COVID-19 crisis began. Simon London speaks with partners Bill Schaninger and Alexander DiLeonardo. Bill is a leader in our global organization practice and Alex is a partner in our London office. Here’s Simon.', 'Simon London: So, Alex and Bill, thank you for doing this. And welcome to the podcast.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thank you for having us.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: It’s a pleasure.', 'Simon London: Good. So Bill, maybe you could start by framing this up for us. Just recap, what are our core beliefs about organizational change and how does the individual fit in?', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, look, it’s a great question. So we’ve built over the course of 20 years a basic belief that said change works when you manage equally for performance and health, or in plain language, how you’re going to make money and how you’re going to run the place. As we’ve been able to go and dig deeper into organizations we have an embedded question that we’ll  often use.', '“If you think about the last year, are things the worse, same, or better?” And what we often find is a tale of two cities. You’ll find groups of employees that really think it’s getting better because they’ve been involved or they feel like they were shaping it.', 'And others feel like they were merely just on the receiving end of it, of ask and demands for performance. When you build something around an average, you start discovering that very few actual individuals look like that perfect average that you built the plan for.', 'So if we were to take that same language, “How do we make money and how do we run the place?” And say, “What would that look like on the individual level?” Well, in performance it wouldn’t be, “How do we make money?” It would be, “How do I individually contribute to driving value in this organization? What do I have to do day-in and day-out in my day job?”', 'And that allows them to have very specific role clarity, but understanding that everything they’re working on matters and how it contributes. And on the health side, right, for the organization, how do we run the place, it’s for every person to go, “How do I have to think and behave different every day to bring this to life?” So that’s the essence.', 'Simon London: So to be successful you’ve got to go down a level. Yet, you’ve got to conceptualize and plan all these things at the level of the organization, but you’ve actually got to approach people at the level of individuals.', 'Bill Schaninger: One hundred percent.', 'Simon London: Now, that’s a pretty tall order, right. That’s a tough thing to do in big organizations with tens of thousands of people across, you know, potentially hundreds of work sites. So just talk a little bit, Alex, about why it’s hard and maybe how we can approach it.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Just to start, if you think about what Bill just mentioned, doing this at the individual level is a good forcing mechanism to get very clear on what you’re trying to do even at the organization level, what is it we’re actually asking them to do? And then when does that show up in their day-to-day jobs?', 'Doing this at the individual level is a good forcing mechanism to get very clear on what you’re trying to do even at the organization level.', 'And then from there, the actual application or methodology of reaching individuals is—is another hurdle. It’s been hard historically because we haven’t had a way to reach individuals on a one-on-one basis. Through technology now we can.', 'And finally, we haven’t had a way historically to enable individuals to really exercise choice in how they’re showing up and living the change. Through advances in behavioral economics and things like nudge theory, now we can.', 'Bill Schaninger: We’ve taken a good deal of, I think, inspiration in insight from places like retail and medicine and education when you’ve allowed large numbers of people to still feel like they can have a completely customized experience.', 'Simon London: You’re talking about mass personalization.', 'Bill Schaninger: One hundred percent. We’re still saying we want an overarching plan. But what we’re saying is set the menu and allow people to choose from the menu.', 'Simon London:  So that all sounds great in theory. But maybe, Alex, just bring it to life for us. Well, how does this actually work in practice?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: So we were working with a global steel manufacturer, think 25,000 frontline employees showing up every day making steel coils, steel rods—from start to finish and shipping them out.', 'This organization has existed for a long time. They had some financial goals they were trying to achieve in the near term. Actually increasing their profitability and operating margin on the front line in terms of how quickly and with, you know, how few resources they could get those steel coils out. The problem statement was, “How do we get 25,000 people all aligned to this goal?” One of the ways was by having frontline employees in different pockets of the organization contribute ideas to increased efficiency.', 'There was a lot of variability in how manufacturing was being done. And so they needed to collect these ideas and then redistribute them so that best practices were kind of applied universally. All of the individuals in this organization had either a personal or a company smartphone. And we built an app that when they would log in, the first thing they would be able to do when they were invited to log in was actually look at what was the overall transformation goal. And they could see their unique role, whether they were an operator, an individual contributor, or a people manager.', 'So for the operator, that individual contributor said, “Hey, you actually have some great knowledge in your job that’s not getting out there. This is the role that you play. These are your jobs to be done that contribute to this rolled-up vision which is quite substantial.”', 'The next thing that we did is we said, “Understanding that you want to contribute these ideas to the rest of your workforce, what might be making it hard? Do you have structural hurdles? You know, do you not have the capabilities to articulate this or the time to talk to your management and share those ideas?', '“Or do you think this is just not a good idea? You’re not bought in?” And then based on what those answers would be, they would actually configure a journey in the mobile application to say, “I actually want some reminders. And I want some help. And I want it Monday morning on my commute.”', 'So people who had structural hurdles would get help problem solving how to remove them. People would get skill- and will-building exercises so they could build their confidence and they could understand why this mattered.', 'And as they went, they would actually check in and share how it was going, whether they liked the content they were receiving. Whether they felt their behaviors were actually changing.', 'And so there were analytics that ran in the background which continuously optimized effectiveness of the interventions and experience that people were getting.', 'Finally, they would contribute ideas, those bottom-up innovation ideas that they wanted from the beginning. We actually piloted with 25 people, just 25 people. Over the course of two months without any top/down communication broadcasts, without any pushing, it has scaled to 5,000 employees that are engaging with this application every day.', 'We’ll eventually get to the 25,000 employees. But that two-month scaling, completely viral kind of methodology of rolling this out was pretty tremendous. And we saw behavior change. Two to four weeks, we saw a 10 percent improvement in the desired behaviors, that idea sharing, that driving toward efficiency. And we actually saw the frontline manufacturing costs come down by another 10 percent, just in this first pilot period.', 'Simon London: Right. Now as you’re talking about that, I’m thinking to myself, “Well, an app is fine. But an app doesn’t sound like a killer idea.”', 'Bill Schaninger: Yeah, look, it’s a great question. Because you could say, “Well, is that it?” Is it just an app? The mere fact that they were going down the road of the app, that they were going down the road of saying, “We are literally going to put it in your hands.” When you think about the substantive and symbolic nature of literally putting it in their hands.', 'As soon as something works, tell us. As soon as something doesn’t work tell us. How awesome is that? So just the modus operandi is so different. I mean, it truly is empowering the people. And I don’t say that lightly. You know, they got to say what works and what didn’t. They put it on the social wall. They put their own street cred behind an idea by putting it on the social wall and say, “Hey, I tried this. This is different. And it works.” We know that most of these things fail largely because it was, like, people from the center would come and tell you what to do. And we’re saying, “No, we’re going to start and flip that on its head.”', 'Simon London: So, yes, Bill, all right, I take the point. Actually, you know, customizing when things are pushed to me and so on actually is meaningful in itself. But just talk a little bit more, Alex, about the content. What is actually delivered to me, customized by role, who I am, how I’m viewing this program?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: So I think there’s one layer which we’ve already touched on which is we’re customizing content based on role and the profile, where you fit in the organization. And that’s pretty straightforward. But potentially the more sophisticated layer of customization is around unique performance barriers.', 'They obviously are trying to do something. And we think about those different items that are standing in their way—there are three. The first is this sense of being not allowed. So are there structural hurdles that they experience in their job where they actually just feel like they can’t do the thing that they want to do because of those structural hurdles.', 'The second is they can’t. So they—they don’t have the time or resources or they don’t have the skills or confidence to actually do the thing that they want to do. And then finally, they won’t. Meaning they actually just don’t have the conviction or buy-in to do whatever it is that their goals are.', 'And the way that we get at these different constructs of roadblocks is through the mobile application coaching. So we say, “Would you like to learn a little bit more about yourself and receive customized feedback that you can either discard or use to your benefit?” And then they answer 15 questions. And we can get, you know, this very psychologically valid assessment of these different roadblock constructs.', 'Simon London: Just out of 15 questions.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Just out of 15 questions. And this assessment, we built on years of research. And we actually piloted it with a broad cohort of working adults. And we saw that, you know, when men take it, they answer the same way that women take it. Different ethnic groups answer the same way other ethnic groups answer. So we feel very confident that these questions are, you know, not biased. And they actually get at the items around roadblocks that we’re targeting.', 'Simon London: So, for me as an individual employee, you can get a pretty good sense of, “Is it that I feel I’m not allowed? Or I can’t. Or I won’t.” And what’s the mix for me personally?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Exactly.', 'Bill Schaninger: Simon, I think it’s useful to pick that one up, the idea that the blocking mindsets, the barrier mindsets, they really are a state, right. A state being who you are meets the environment you’re in. And certainly if—if the transformation’s working—', 'Simon London: It will change.', 'Bill Schaninger: An environment’s going to change, right? That’s why you need to keep checking in on it. And even something as simple as saying, “Well, I’m not allowed.” Knowing which version of it is there for you really drives what action you take. If someone says, “I don’t think it’s my job,” you probably do need to help them with role clarity.', 'I mean, somewhere along the line they missed it, right. You need to revisit it. But if someone is saying, “Hey, that’s not how we do it around here.” Well, that’s violating a social norm. That is a big deal.', 'OK, for these people, they’re going to need to see opinion leaders behaving differently before they move a nudge. As opposed to, “I just need to go over my job description.” That was the power of this. But then every time we introduce a new behavior, we better just check in and make sure we understand what’s getting in the way.', 'Simon London: Say a little bit more the, “I’m not allowed. I can’t.” And a particularly interesting one is, “I won’t.”', 'Bill Schaninger: We just talked about not allowed. Now, can’t is interesting. Can’t. Sometimes people will say, “Well, I can’t, because I don’t know how. And I actually don’t have confidence I can do it.” And the beauty of that is, it’s someone showing humility to raise their hand and say—and because very few people like to go, “I actually don’t know how to do this.”', 'And by the way, if you’re a leader and someone’s raising their hand and say they can’t, you darn well better help them. That’s your job at that point, right.', 'And by the way, if you’re a leader and someone’s raising their hand to say they can’t, you darn well better help them.', 'The other two are little more interesting. Because they’re saying, “I can’t, because I don’t have the time or I don’t have the resources.”', 'And when you really get at it, what they’re saying, “It’s a great idea. But your priorities are not my priorities. And my list is different. And I’m solving for my list. Because that comes down to an allocation of my time, my money, and my people.” If you hear that, you have missed it out of the gate about landing the aspiration for how important this is.', 'And you should stop. You should stop until you land that. Because, you know, we’d like to say the axiom is, “Shouting louder is not going to work.” They don’t buy in to how important it is. Not only will they not give, like, in-role behavior, time and resources. You’re certainly not going to extra-role behavior. So you must address that directly so they actually get that part.', 'Deeper and often harder to surface—and you almost always have to work your way through—and I’m not allowed or I can’t. And then sometimes you go, “OK, we solved all that. We’re clear on the list. And yes, it’s your job.” And you’re still not seeing change.', 'Then you get down into the, “I don’t want to.” Classic, classic. What it really comes down to is in the head of the person you’re asking something says, “I am scared. I don’t know what’s going to happen here. I think this is going to mess up my power, my relationships, my influence, my—my own perception of my ability to be successful.” If you’re messing with that, the safest response is always inaction, always.', 'Simon London: You mean the safest response for the individual.', 'Bill Schaninger: One hundred percent.', 'Simon London: Because they’re facing fear.', 'Bill Schaninger: Freeze. Freeze, it’s, like, an amygdala response. The more the boss ratchets it up, “I want you to do this.”', 'Simon London: The more you’re going to freeze.', 'Bill Schaninger: Now, some flee, right. But most—they don’t have that option because it’s their job. So they will either actively be against you and undermine you, which at least you can see it. Or they’re going to freeze, right. And so that’s why this idea of, “If I can understand where you are emotionally, I have a dramatically higher likelihood of being able help you get across the, the—', 'Simon London: And the point is—', 'Bill Schaninger: Rubicon.', 'Simon London: That every individual employee will be at a different place—', 'Bill Schaninger: One hundred percent.', 'Simon London: And have a different mix of these. And just solving for the averages which until now is pretty much all we’ve been able to do is not going to be as effective.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Now we know in real time if it’s working. So what we found in the manufacturing example that I shared is, when you looked at the constructs of, “not allowed, can’t, and won’t,” all of the behaviors shifted positively based on the interventions that we’re providing.', 'Not allowed and won’t shifted much more positively than the can’t folks. And this was actually a little counterintuitive. Because I know psychology would say that it’s hardest to shift a won’t mindset. If they don’t have conviction of buy-in, it’s a really tough job.', 'But we were actually doing an OK job of helping them change their behaviors. But the folks that didn’t have the skills or the confidence, we got real-time feedback, I’m talking days, weeks. We knew immediately that our interventions were not working for those folks.', 'So what did we do? We clicked down one more level of granularity. We broke out the tasks into different subtasks and said, “Here, practice this. Teach this to somebody else. Do it. Build confidence. And come back.” And then we saw the can’t roadblock shifting. So it’s hard to imagine just splitting these people up into the archetypes without also getting the real-time feedback on what’s working and for whom. I think there’s a magic when you mix both.', 'Simon London: So the thing that’s going through my mind though is, however good your content is, however personalized this is for me—and I think you alluded to this earlier, Bill—in any big organization, there is going to be a broad mass, maybe even the majority of employees, are either cynical, change fatigued. They’ve got other things going on in their lives. How do you overcome that? How do you actually get people to engage with this?', 'Bill Schaninger: I think the cynicism sits with both frontline employees as well as leaders. You know, you have leaders who are under duress, under time pressure. And if they could treat their employees as homogenous, it made it simpler. Employees, on the other hand, felt rightly that there was no—there was no “I” there, there was no individual there. It was everyone should be treated the same.', 'And the minute they get an email, they should magically just get it. So I think that cynicism comes in both directions. The data is beyond question. Right, when these things fail, they almost always blow up because leaders lack support, they’re not willing to make the tough calls, the culture doesn’t support it, and/or you never bring the bulk of the place along.', 'And I think what Alex and the team have really been pushing is trying to balance this tension of the need for scale and the need for customization. But always anchored back to “what’s the point for doing all of it?”', 'Simon London: So I buy that answer. But presumably you also need to address, like, the formal mechanisms within an organization as well. How are people assessed? How are they compensated? How are the roles defined? You still need that architecture.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Yeah. And I would argue two things. I would argue, one, that the large components of the influence model, all four quadrants—the way we think about it, are embedded in this approach. You’re just hitting them at a different level.', 'I would also argue though that this approach should be one thread in a broader, kind of laundry list of things that you do in a healthy transformation, which would include what leadership does. You know, hardwiring the change. Whether it’s from a process perspective or reinforcement and compensation mechanisms.', 'Simon London: Yeah. So it’s not a magic bullet. But having said that, it—it’s pretty powerful and could be a big unlock for how you address change at the level of individuals.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Right. And I would argue that it’s probably going to work more effectively when it is tied to all those other threads of a transformation, as opposed to a stand-alone stream.', 'Simon London: So just double click, if you don’t mind, this idea that you’re getting constant feedback as the management team, as the team running this change and transformation program. You’re getting feedback through the app and other mechanisms. How does that actually change how you run a program?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: The analogy that I go to is how we develop software. So from the beginning of when we were doing computer science and developing software, we originally followed the quote, unquote “waterfall methodology.” So you create the vision, you collect requirements, you do a detailed design.', 'You build whatever it is. You test it. And then you roll it out, and in a lot of ways, that’s the way we’ve been running the transformation office for the last 20, 30, 40, even more years. What this gives us the opportunity to do is to shift to an agile development model.', 'Now, we can say, “Let’s get started. Let’s see what happens after two weeks. And let’s measure at each iteration.” We can measure things like how many people are involved? Do people like the content? Are they learning? Are they changing their behaviors? And are bottom-line outcomes actually shifting?', 'Imagine being able to have a control room where you have a window into that every day, every week, every month. And then you take things out that aren’t working. You put new things in where you need them. You see—you know, an archetype or a segment of the population emerge that’s very healthy.', 'How do we illuminate them and actually elevate them so they’re sharing with other people?', 'Simon London: Do you need different skills, like, in that control room? Do you need different people? Do you need behavioral scientists and analytics people in the way that you might not have done? Certainly not with the same level of intensity before?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: What we found—and we’ve been doing analytics in organization and HR now for almost a decade—what we’ve found is that a lot of the core skills that were relevant before are still the dominant skills. You still need to know a lot about the content.', 'You need IO [industrial-organizational] psychologists that actually understand the theory of how humans react to environments and change their behaviors. You need business buy-in. You need business sponsorship. And you need, you know, HR professionals that are data savvy, that can drive the process, that can create change in the organization.', 'So I would say keep the core skills that we’ve relied on. Just change the methodology.', 'If I could build on that. You need enough skill in the room to be brutally clear on what performance impact you’re looking for and be able to disaggregate that down to the individual level. Many leaders are really good at waving their hands towards a big number.', 'They may not be capable of breaking it down, disaggregating. So you need that help. Someone with the courage enough to set the big number, someone capable of disaggregating it. That’s for one. You need someone who can say what kind of skills does that require to be able to do it. No doubt.', 'You also need someone who brings enough due care that the environment you’re going to create in pursuit of helping someone change their behavior is done thoughtfully. We’re not interested in creating undue pressure. We’re not interested in creating a contagion that generates fear, right?', 'So I do think there is a skill there. And probably does have more of an IO background to it, at least from a thoughtfulness standpoint. Right, because, you know, we hear a lotta things called nudge. Unfortunately, when you look at a lot of it, it’s more like nag. It’s a reminder email sent to everyone. Here’s a good rule of thumb, if it’s sent to everyone, it’s not a nudge.', 'Simon London: Right. So if done badly, this just turns out to be personalized nagging? Or not even very personalized.', 'Bill Schaninger: Broadcast nagging. Right. I mean, and then, look, I’m being just a little dismissive. But just understanding. What really motivates a person? Do they need to feel part of the group, in which case you should tailor it to how the group is doing? Do they need to win desperately? Show them a league table. Do they need to live up to what they’ve said? Remind them of the commitment they made.', 'That sort of tailoring does require skill and thoughtfulness. And that’s the kind of thing we’re getting at.', 'Simon London: Now, the elephant in the room here, and we haven’t really addressed it yet, is data privacy, surveillance. So I find the steel worker—the app is on my phone, I’m starting to interact with it. What am I buying into? What’s happening to my data? Am I worried that, you know, the boss is looking up whether I’m using this?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Good data-handling practice, and I think this aligns a lot with sort of the guidelines that are set out by GDPR, has three points. One is optionality, the second is transparency, and the third is protection. Optionality means that you are not forcing anybody to participate in this.', 'Good data-handling practice ... has three points. One is optionality, the second is transparency, and the third is protection.', 'They are asking for help and they are getting help. And if at any time they find it not helpful or they don’t want to participate, they can actually choose to wipe all their data and disengage from the platform. The second is transparency, which means we’re going to be very up front with what information we’re asking, why it’s helpful and how it ties to the broader strategy. And then the third is protection.', 'And protection has two parts. One is just good hardware and software and methodology around how you handle data. But potentially more importantly is what do you do with that data and what does it look like when you’re reporting back to organizational leadership.', 'And so what we’ve done in the steel case, for example, is anything under ten records, that doesn’t actually get surfaced to insights when we’re showing results to leaders. And so we’re offering these individuals the help that they’re asking for. But it is optional. They have transparency into why this matters. And they’re actually getting the protection.', 'Simon London: So the boss is, in theory at least, not going to know whether I as an individual am even participating in this program or not.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Exactly. And in this case, we’re actually acting as the data controller instead of the data processor. Which means we’re not handling your individual employee data on behalf of your employer at the company. We’re handling your data on behalf of you. You have control over it and you can wipe it at any time. And you’re actually the person to whom we’re accountable.', 'Simon London: Right. Because that seems to me a very important set of principles. And I can imagine that, you know, some companies frankly may not do this right.', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, the opt-in part is a big deal, right, if you think about choice. I mean, nudge at its core was intended to be choice architecture, right? And so running through and through this is choice. And I also think it’s an opportunity for the employee just to choose how they’re going to experience the transformation.', 'What we’re trying to say is, but it doesn’t have to be that way for everyone. You actually do have an option to engage with this differently, to give yourself a more informed, a more involved, a more enlightened way of saying, “Maybe I can thrive in this environment.”', 'That’s the hope, because you could say the organization’s going do this regardless, right? So why not put your hands on the wheel a little bit more as an employee?', 'Simon London: So I think an interesting question here is sort of why is this happening now? Is it just the analytics and the delivery mechanism? And all that is available. Or is it actually that something’s changing up in a macro environment that is making this more important to do?', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Yeah, there’s certainly a component that is technology evolution, though—many would argue that the tools that we’re using here have been around for five to ten years. But I think from a macro perspective, and I know it’s a cliché, you know, the pace of change has never been as great as it is today. And it will just continue to increase and accelerate.', 'And when you have that context, where people are not going to be in the same job for their entire careers. They’re going to change jobs maybe multiple times a decade, maybe multiple times a year. With all of that entropy also comes a little bit of opacity.', 'And so for the worker, I think it’s very exciting that we can help people tie themselves to the overall strategy and the overall goals, whatever they are, of the day, of the week, of the year. Help them understand where they fit in, and then help them diagnose their roadblocks. And essentially, just build a road to be higher performing and to contribute more.', 'Bill Schaninger: You know, I think there’s an interesting challenge for leaders if you come to grips with the idea that they’re asking their employees to take a less personalized experience at work than they get at home or as consumers.', 'Their experience as consumers, their experience as patients in a healthcare setting is largely configurable and customizable to them. And we continue to ask employees to say, “You’re just like everybody else.” I mean, it’s remarkable, right?', 'And I think part of that is leaders have to come to grips with the simplifying devices they’ve used to make their jobs understandable to them have to go away. They can’t keep treating the entire organization as a monolith, as a block.', 'Simon London: So we need to change how we do change?', 'Bill Schaninger: Change how we do change. Employees deserve and are increasingly demanding more. You don’t have the luxury of these things taking five years anymore, three years anymore, right? What we’ve learned from agile ways of working suggest “if you build it, they will come” is not going to work.', 'Simon London: So is there an element of this that, instead of going through sort of endless five-year change programs, which probably only make it two or three years in before they get replaced by the next five-year change program, actually, we’re getting into more of a continuous improvement, continuous change, but individualized change mindset.', 'Alexander DiLeonardo: Yeah. What if it’s just called leading your organization.', 'Bill Schaninger: Right. I mean, all the way back to literally your first question, which is how we make money and how we run the place. Let’s maybe change how we run the place.', 'Simon London: Yeah. All right. Well, thank you for a fascinating and insightful conversation.

Today, we are going to be putting on our favorite outfits, getting all dressed up, and talking about the state of fashion—who’s making money, who’s not, the rise of fashion tech, and the common challenges posed by sustainability.', 'To discuss the state of fashion, I spoke with McKinsey partner Achim Berg, who’s based in Frankfurt, and Imran Amed, who is the London-based founder, CEO, and editor-in-chief of the media company Business of Fashion. We started by discussing the latest State of Fashion report, which is published jointly by Business of Fashion and McKinsey.', 'I should point out that we recorded this episode immediately before the Coronavirus outbreak in China. While we do talk about the state of fashion in Asia, we don’t address coronavirus directly in this episode.', 'So Imran and Achim, welcome to the podcast, and thank you for being here.', 'Imran Amed: Thank you for having us.', 'Achim Berg: Thanks a lot.', 'Simon London: So Imran, why don’t you start by giving us the highlights from the latest report. I know we survey a large number of fashion executives to take the temperature of the industry. So are they cheerful? Are they miserable? What are they saying about the outlook?', 'Imran Amed: With an economic environment that’s getting more and more uncertain, there is more and more uncertainty in the fashion industry.', 'You know, for several years now, executives have been using words like “challenging” and “changing” when we’ve talked to them for this annual survey. But this year, the percentage of executives who were positive about the growth to come next year was at its lowest level ever. It was down to 9 percent, compared to 49 percent last year. So there has been a radical important shift in mindset and outlook.', 'In the big emerging markets, particularly China, that the luxury and fashion industries have relied upon for the last few years to continue to drive growth, the growth seems to be slowing. And then there’s political uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and all sorts of other unknown elements that are lurking in the background. And I think people are just very cautious at the moment. So that’s kind of how I’d sum it up. Achim, what you would add?', 'Achim Berg: I think that is a very good description of what we’ve seen over the last couple of years. We obviously have also seen an intensifying competition. All the digital players have entered the playing field and have had clear impact on the more incumbent players. And we generally see that there is increased polarization happening in the industry.', 'We see that the top performers got a bigger and bigger share of the profit pool. By now, only 45 percent of all the players that we survey in our McKinsey Global Fashion Index are value contributing, while 55 percent are value destroying. And, in general, it’s getting more polarized.', 'It is more difficult to make a profit, particularly if you are a midsize, midmarket player, because you have to deal with the omnichannel world, with digitization, and with sustainability. So there are a lot of demands on what you need to do. And there is a small number of very big players that are incredibly successful, incredibly profitable, and they can afford to invest into all the things you would want to invest into.', 'Imran Amed: One of the things that comes up in conversations that I have with some of the executives at the helm of some of the smaller, but still sizable, businesses out there is that there’s been kind of an ongoing wave of consolidation in the industry, which has made some of the biggest players even bigger.', 'You know, most recently we saw LVMH gobble up Tiffany in a $16.2 billion deal. And as these big players, such as LVMH and Kering on the luxury side and Inditex and H&M [H&M Hennes & Mauritz] on the “fast fashion” side, continue to get bigger, the other players in those spaces are finding it harder and harder to keep up.', 'Simon London: So Achim, you mentioned the McKinsey Global Fashion Index, which is this ranking of the 20 most profitable fashion companies. It is a fascinating list; it’s also a diverse list—lots of different types of companies in there. So what unites them? What are they doing right?', 'Achim Berg: We’ve started to publish a list that we call the “super winners.” It’s a very diverse group, as you say. But you can clearly see some of the big trends of the last couple of years impacting that list.', 'So athleisure and sports have been top of mind now for a couple of years—double-digit growth. And you can see players such as Nike heading the list and also ADIDAS, and now, Lululemon [Lululemon Athletica Canada] and EnterSports [EnterSports Management] have entered that list.', 'You can see that other trends, such as luxury at the top end of the market, are represented: LVMH, Kering, MS. But you also see the discount players that have done quite well in recent years on that list—T.J.Maxx, as an example. So we see a lot of the trends that have impacted the market also coming through—through the size, but also the profitability, of those businesses.', 'Simon London: Imran, anything you’d add to that?', 'Imran Amed: Yeah, I think the other thing is the power of brands. And if you look at this list, while they may be at different—positioning in the overall market all the way from value to luxury—what you do notice is brands are still really, really important in this industry.', 'Nike, LVMH, Lululemon, and Burberry: these are all examples of really powerful brands. And while operational efficiency and staying in touch with where the consumer wants to shop, when it comes to retail and omnichannel and some of these other things, continue to be really important, we shouldn’t underestimate the importance of brands. A lot of these bigger players that are generating disproportionate amounts of economic profit can invest more in their brands. And in this age that we live in, which is very similar for other consumer-facing industries, a lot of that investment is happening in the digital sphere and creation of content on social media.', 'And these companies, especially the high-end fashion companies, what they’ve always specialized in is creating really, really beautiful, high-value content that creates some kind of emotional response or reaction within the consumer base. That has now taken to a whole new level on social-media channels, and it’s happening on a daily basis.', 'All the digital players have entered the playing field and have had clear impact on the more incumbent players.', 'So we’ve gone from this environment where these companies are planning quarterly ad campaigns linked to seasons, and they’re now moving to more robust, always-on content campaigns, events, and immersive experiences, all of which play out on social media all the time. And so the power of the brand is still really important.', 'Achim Berg: I think it’ s also interesting what we do not see on that list. You do not see any department stores on that list. You do not see any pure-play players, marketplaces, on that list. You only see now two additions from Asia that are new on the list. So we didn’t have an Asian player on the top 20 last year.', 'And I think that also tells you something. There are certain business models that are in decline. There are others, such as the digital players, that are going for market share more than for absolute profitability. And we should also expect to see more Asian players on that top 20 list going forward.', 'Simon London: I think it’s always worth pointing out that these are all publicly listed companies, right, because we need access to the public data to do the calculations. And there are some very meaningful privately owned players in fashion, that, if the data were available, might be on the list. That’s right, isn’t it?', 'Achim Berg: So you’re right. The list is based on publicly available data; therefore, we are using listed companies. But it’s also important to recognize that there are a significant number of privately owned companies out there that are also quite sizable, yeah.', 'So we have companies that have more than ten billion in turnover, such as Chanel, but you also get a lot of companies that are somewhere between one billion and five billion, seven billion, or eight billion in turnover. Not to talk about the hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands, of companies that are somewhere between a couple of hundred million and a billion in turnover. So a lot of the business is still privately owned, and that is a very significant part. We still believe that the publicly available data give us a good proxy on what’s going on in this industry.', 'Simon London: Could we just talk a little more about Asia? You mentioned that a couple of Asian companies are now on the list of value creators. What else is going on in the very big Asian market?', 'Imran Amed: Well listen, one thing that hasn’t changed is that China remains the single-most important market in the world and in the fashion industry and continues to drive a disproportionate share of growth. However, it is worth noting that growth is slowing in China. And so one of the trends that we’ve identified for the state of fashion in 2020 is that there are other markets. And there’s 1.2 billion consumers under the age of 30 in a range of countries, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and India.', 'I think that’s really important to note. Because although lots of fashion companies have been kind of razor focused on China in recent years—as they should be—what we were trying to underscore is this: as the Chinese market does begin to slow down a bit, while remaining important, it’s worth considering and reevaluating their strategies and thinking for some of these other markets where there’s an even younger, very hungry, emerging consumer base that is looking to connect with the fashion industry.', 'The long-term fundamentals of India and Southeast Asia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and these other emerging markets remain very important for the industry to consider.', 'Achim Berg: In addition to what Imran just said, I think it’s interesting to understand that competition is also increasing from China—and from the Asian markets, in general. You see that when you look at the top 20 list, where now Anta (PH) and HLA made it among the top 20. They weren’t there last year.', 'The whole business has become much more borderless and volatile. And Asian players will take that to their advantage and will be even more present on the Western markets.', 'Imran Amed: I think, for a long time, our industry has thought of Asia in respect of two key dimensions: first being the workshop and manufacturing zone, and second being the growing consumer base. But there’s a third dimension where Asia’s playing a stronger and stronger role: in Asia, we’re starting to see real competitors develop, as they move further up the value chain and start becoming direct competitors to some of the brands in the West.', 'And you know, there was this kind of phenomenon over the past year called “the Amazon Coat,” which became a viral sensation on social media. But as it turns out, the manufacturer made $5 million in sales in one month—more than the company’s entire revenue for 2017—from this coat. And it was a Chinese manufacturer that produced this coat and then distributed it on Amazon.', 'Simon London: So that’s a nice segue to the fashion-tech sector. And we actually have fashion-tech unicorns now—fashion start-ups with billion-dollar valuations. So the obvious question is, how serious are these as competitors to the really big brands?', 'Achim Berg: We are quite proud that we’ve foreseen at least some of the unicorns that you’re referring to. Last year, we looked into a trend that was called “the end of ownership.” And it was not only renting merchandise; it was also the resale of preloved products. And we felt there was a bigger trend hitting the market.', 'The valuation of Rent the Runway is a very good example underpinning that. But we also see that players such as StockX, ABOUT YOU, and Allbirds have achieved valuations of $1 billion and more, which underscores the relevance of fashion tech. It’s where the fashion side of the business collides with technology.', 'And in the second tier, you see players, such as ThirdLove and Moda Operandi, that are active in lingerie or luxury fashion and get high valuations—and that is, in the end, a reflection of the appreciation they get from the consumers.', 'So there is a whole part of the industry that is different and much more tech driven than it used to be. It’s not the old game of a great designer that has just has the right silhouettes and colors and handwriting and is therefore celebrated by the market. There’s a whole new dimension to that play.', 'Imran Amed: The one thing I would just add, as a note of caution, is that I suspect—and I think Achim would probably agree—that there’s a bit of a bubble effect happening here, especially around some of these direct-to-consumer companies that have raised a significant amount of capital at very, very high valuations. And some of these companies are having to spend a lot of money on customer acquisition in order to continue to meet their growth targets, which makes the long-term profitability prospects for these companies questionable.', 'We’ve also seen a similar phenomenon this year with Farfetch [Farfetch UK], which has, for the past few years, been a company that the industry has been watching very, very carefully. It did a very successful IPO about a year ago. But over the past year, as the competition in the market around e-commerce—and particularly luxury e-commerce—has continued to grow, a lot of the players have had to spend a lot of money on marketing and customer acquisition, and this has kind of deteriorated margins.', 'So it will be interesting to watch this space: although it’s buoyant, and there are all these new players, there will be a shakeout at some stage. And I think—particularly as we enter an economic environment that seems to be darker and maybe more challenging—the bar will be raised for these players in terms of actually being able to deliver on all of the expectations.', 'Simon London: Now you mentioned that some of the fashion-tech players are focused on previously owned or rented fashion, which is in tune with the zeitgeist around reuse- and circular-economy-type principles. I also noticed in this year’s survey that executives said sustainability is both the number-one challenge and, indeed, the number-one opportunity for the industry! So just say a bit more about sustainability and how the fashion industry is positioning itself and responding.', 'Imran Amed: So as an industry, one of the biggest challenges is to get a common understanding. Yes, while this is a big opportunity, and yes, it presents a huge challenge, what exactly is sustainable fashion? It’s not quite as easy as you see in some of the other sectors.', 'The inherent challenge is, as an industry, in order to continue growing, we are driving consumers to purchase more, to consume more. And actually, there’s this dilemma: as we drive more consumption, we’re actually growing the carbon footprint of the industry.', 'So I think, as we look to next year, there is this dilemma around growth: How do we continue to have growing profitable businesses while addressing the kind of carbon footprint, the sustainable footprint, of our industry? And so, I think about it as, yes, a challenge but also finding that common understanding and recalibrating what we see as being a healthy way for this industry to exist. And that sounds maybe slightly conceptual or philosophical. But I do think it’s an underlying challenge.', 'Achim Berg: So we should all go undressed?', 'Imran Amed: No, I think it’s that, as we observe consumption in our industry, the biggest challenge is really around fast-fashion companies and the consumer behavior that we’ve been encouraging, which is people purchasing items of clothing. And sometimes they’re only worn once or twice before they’re discarded, or they’re sitting in a closet. I think the average US consumer now purchases something like 60 new garments of clothing per year—or more than that.', 'You know, there is a dynamic here that we’ve trained the consumer to pursue, which is not consistent with the industry’s supposed goals of becoming more sustainable. And I see an inherent contradiction there. It feels like the elephant in the room. And that seems like an area that we, as an industry, are really going to have to get our heads around.', 'Achim Berg: And I think, to make things even more complex, that’s very much a perspective on the Western and developed markets. You still have big emerging markets, as we discussed earlier. And in the big emerging markets, one of the categories that is boosted when growth pushes the middle class is clothing. So that’s where people spend a significant share of their wallet—on apparel. And I think it’s not a solution to prevent people from doing that. So we probably need to find solutions on doing that in a less harmful way to the planet.', 'And as a matter of fact, the fashion industry is a dirty industry. People don’t like that to be pointed out. But the way we still produce a lot of garments in the industry is not very efficient: more than 70 percent of products end up unused. And also, the way we produce has some issues—the water treatment, the pollution that comes with it, labor rights.', 'I think it comes back to your terminology aspect. What do we really mean with “sustainability”? But if you take a closer look, it’s not a very nice picture. And therefore, I think the industry has an obligation to improve that.', 'Imran Amed: And we need to think about, in addition to impacts on the environment, the impacts on the people who make our clothes. So one of the things I think, as an industry, we’re really going to have to get our heads around is that we’re producing garments—sometimes in very, very questionable conditions—and not paying people enough to make those clothes, just so we can provide cheap, fast fashion to consumers, often in the West, sometimes in the East. And that’s a very, very challenging conundrum to get our heads around. And I think this is the thing that we need to get out and really discuss openly now, especially as it’s front of mind.', 'According to our executive survey, sustainability has appeared at the top of the list for executives, which is the first time in the history of this survey. So I think that’s the silver lining here: executives have finally taken note. And I think it’s time for us, as an industry, to really look at this and face it head on.', 'Simon London: I’m intrigued by fast fashion, which you mentioned in there. But you know, I would have thought that the fast-fashion business model is particularly challenged in a world in which a lot of consumers care deeply about sustainability. Does fast fashion have a future?', 'Imran Amed: I think it has a future but not in its current form. And I think with the fast-fashion players—a couple of which appear very highly on this list of super winners—if you have an honest, private conversation with executives who work there, off the record, they’ll talk to you, and there is an existential crisis happening amongst these players because they understand what’s going on in the market.', 'They understand shifting consumer sentiments. The consumer focus and sentiment around the fast-fashion segment is really beginning to shift, especially amongst informed consumers in the kind of Generation Z and millennial cohorts, who are increasingly stepping back and saying, “Listen, I’m looking ahead.”', 'I see Greta Thunberg in the streets with hundreds of thousands of climate protesters having these school strikes. I see the extinction rebellion in the streets shutting down huge parts of London. And it’s building awareness—mainstream, mass awareness—around climate crisis.', 'I think these things are really going to become a collision at some stage. So if you’re an executive at one of these fast-fashion players, and you’re observing the change happening in the market, I’m sure you’re thinking, “Wow, we’re going to have to really radically rethink how we, as a business, exist.”', 'I don’t think it means there’s no future for these companies. I just think it means, for the business model, just as they’ve been so creative and thinking about building responsive supply chains and making sure they address the trends and things that consumers are after, they have to apply that same level of thinking and innovation to the way they manage their supply chains—so they’re not quite so damaging to the environment.', 'Simon London: Talking of supply chain, we haven’t really touched yet on the fashion store and the role that it plays. We talked about direct-to-consumer business models; we talked about the impact of the big e-commerce platforms. What does all this mean for the future of the fashion store? What role does it play in this changing world?', 'Imran Amed: The store definitely has a future. But I think what we’ve started to see is that the store is playing a different role now than perhaps the transactional role that it played in the past. And whereas our industry was formerly focused on a very simple chain of events that would drive consumers to a store—a collection would be designed, advertisements would be published, consumers would see advertisements, and they’d go directly to a store—that customer journey has radically changed.', 'And what it means is, consumers are obviously getting information on digital channels now, and they’re also able to transact on digital channels. The store therefore performs an additional role, which is to really service that consumer and immerse them in the brand—to give them the access, education, and service that they can’t get on a digital platform or an e-commerce platform.', 'And I think the most innovative retailers are understanding how these digital and physical channels work together. I think people who are talking about the retail apocalypse and the end of the store are incorrect. I mean, yes, there is a shakeout happening on high streets. But in all of those places where you see stores closing, you see new ones opening up. In fact, some of them are the stores of brands that used to be digitally native brands—that didn’t have any physical presence. And the fact that companies such as Away and Glossier and some of these other ones are actually building physical stores shows that, even for digital brands, having a physical presence is a really important part of creating that connection with the customer.', 'Achim Berg: I couldn’t agree more. I think it’s not digital versus offline; I think it’s, in the end, all a combination. And call it “omnichannel” or “digitally enabled retail”: in the end, it needs to satisfy consumer needs. And there are different needs.', 'There’s a convenience need that online is typically very good in serving. There is a need for entertainment and excitement that a store, in many ways, is better able to serve. But there’s also a need for some neighborhood shopping. And if you look at the trends that we’ve identified in the new report, we see that there is a trend toward that neighborhood store.', 'But it’s not just the kind of small store that is convenient and close by. It’s a digitally enabled store where some of the leading players look into how you can use the information you get from your e-commerce, from your loyalty systems, and from all the other stores you have to provide an offering that is tailored to a specific neighborhood. And we believe if you use modern technology and data, you have a good opportunity to also enable offline stores to be successful.', 'Simon London: Yeah. So the future is, indeed, omnichannel?', 'Achim Berg: The future is omnichannel.', 'Imran Amed: I’d say the present is omnichannel. It’s already there. It’s just, in some cases, a matter of some of the players catching up with where the consumer’s been already for a few years now.', 'Simon London: Okay, so I think we are out of time for today. Imran and Achim, thank you so much for a fascinating conversation about the state of fashion.', 'Achim Berg: Thank you very much, Simon, for the good discussion.', 'Imran Amed: Thanks for having me.

Despite pockets of excellence, Asian companies have struggled to deliver strong returns on this influx of capital.","['Over the past decade, Asia received half of all new investment in the global economy. Despite pockets of excellence, Asian companies have struggled to deliver strong returns on this influx of capital.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Chris Bradley and Jonathan Woetzel about the growth of Asia’s companies and how corporate Asia has pockets that are creating value. This episode is brought to you by the McKinsey Global Institute.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. It is no secret that the world’s economic center of gravity has shifted decisively to the East. Before long, Asia will account for more than half of global GDP. But less widely understood is how this shift has affected corporate Asia—how Asia’s companies have grown; in what sectors are they clustered; and, importantly, how are they doing in terms of value creation.', 'For an overview of corporate Asia, I caught up with McKinsey partners Chris Bradley, who is based in Sydney, and Jonathan Woetzel, who is based in Shanghai. Chris and Jonathan were actually together in Shanghai for this conversation, and I spoke to them from my base here in California. So, Jonathan and Chris, welcome to the podcast and thank you for joining.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Glad to be here, Simon.', 'Chris Bradley: Thanks, Simon. Great to be here.', 'Simon London: You’re both working on a project to get a clearer picture of the scale and performance of Asia’s companies. Chris, why don’t you start by describing the research for us and some of the key takeaways?', 'Chris Bradley: The way we looked at that was we compiled a database of the 5,000 largest companies in the world over two different periods of time, ten years apart. We looked between 2005 to 2007, and we looked between 2015 to 2017. We asked ourselves, “How’s the composition of that Global 5,000 changed? What does that tell us about the geographic centers of corporate profitability?”', 'What we found was that Asia went from 28 percent of the world’s capital base to 40 percent over this ten-year period. What that means is that more than half of the growth—more than $1.00 in every $2.00 of new investment that went into corporates—actually went into Asia.', 'Most notably, it’s China, which only had 429 companies in the first period but now has more than 900. What’s even more startling is the average size of these companies. They’ve just gotten so much bigger because the invested capital, over that same period of time, in Asia has tripled.', 'Simon London: So, a vast amount of capital invested in Asia and a lot more Asian companies—notably Chinese companies—[are] now in the Global 5000. What about returns on that capital? If you look at corporate performance, in aggregate, of Asian companies, how are they doing?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Well, in a word, not quite as good as the rest of the world; maybe that was a few words. The returns, on average, are lower than you would find in the EU [European Union] and certainly relative to North America. What’s striking is the relative outperformance, if you want, in terms of invested capital and the underperformance in terms of economic profit. Over the past decade, big North American companies delivered 9.3 percent [in] annual ROIC [returns on invested capital]; Asian companies, 7 percent. And if you think about the overall economic profit, [it is] $245 billion for North American companies, whereas Asian companies had economic losses of $206 billion—in short, a fairly massive level of value destruction from Asian companies.', 'Simon London: Before we go any further, just make sure I’m clear on what the terminology means here.', 'Chris Bradley: The main two numbers we’ll throw around to talk about corporate performance that get all companies on an apples-to-apples basis is return on invested capital, or ROIC, which is simply the net operating profit less tax, divided by the total invested capital of the company. The other measure we use is economic profit, which is a measure of how much profit is left after you deduct the cost of capital.', 'Simon London: Thanks for that. Sorry to be dense!', 'Chris Bradley: Now, it’s not that all Asian companies are unprofitable; it’s just that they’re overrepresented among the companies that are unprofitable. For example, in the bottom quintile of economic profit globally, rather than having the 20 percent of companies that you’d expect, Asia has 25 percent of its companies down there. In the top quintile of economic profit, rather than the 20 percent of companies you’d expect, Asia has only 15 percent of its companies there. It still has substantial champions, extremely high performers, and—we’ll come to it later—real pockets of value creation. There’s just a drift slightly downward toward more companies that are destroying value.', 'Simon London: What do we know about why this is the case? What explains this overrepresentation of Asian companies in the bottom quintile of economic performance?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I think that [there] are probably at least three things going on here. Asia overall—I mean, because we’re speaking, again, of a region with huge disparities—but, overall, it’s still less developed, particularly in the higher-value-added, higher-technology, and higher-value segments of the economy, like technology and pharma, which do account for a substantial portion of the economic profit of North America. So that’s underrepresented.', 'What’s overrepresented are, let’s say, domestic services—basically, construction, real estate, infrastructure, utilities—the things that one does at an earlier stage of economic development, and so it’s very capital intensive in particular. Commodities like energy and metals and mining, which are also investment intensive, also tend to appear at earlier stages of economic development. Those two sectors are overrepresented in Asia, particularly in China. They account for the majority of the losses. If we look at the “troubled 200,” [we see] a lot of names like “XYZ State Construction Company” and “XYZ Highway Company,” plus “XYZ Raw Materials and Mining Corporation.”', 'Chris Bradley: If we just map it out by the numbers and we look at “Well, why is it that the US has a higher return on invested capital than Asia does?,” it breaks out pretty accurately that two-thirds of the gap is driven by capital allocation to different sectors. So there’s more capital going toward lower-performing sectors. There’s still a gap of one-third that is within sector performance and is lower inside of Asia. There’s also a really important dynamic story because it’s not just about where capital is now but where it’s being allocated over time. Here I’d highlight a really big difference.', 'In the US, for example, over the last ten years there was $6.1 trillion of new capital put into companies; that’s net invested capital. Eleven percent of that went into sectors that earn below their cost of capital, so that destroys value. China, on the other hand, added almost $10 trillion of invested capital onto its balance sheet—net invested capital—but 80 percent of that amount went into sectors that earned below their cost of capital.', 'What we’ve seen is this capital allocation drifting globally toward lower-returning sectors. I think, as Jonathan says, part of that is because there’s a sector story that accompanies your S-curve of development. But there’s also clearly something in there around capital allocation. By the way, the rest of Asia is better than China but not that much better.', 'In the rest of Asia, excluding China, 68 percent of the net new invested capital went into sectors that earned below their cost of capital. There seems to be something that’s keeping America at the top economically, at least in terms of corporate performance, which is around being really strong in sectors that are higher returning—this is anything related to science, health, technology, and computers—while at the same time having economic systems that direct the marginal dollar toward better opportunities.', 'Simon London: Is there also something related to the balance of listed versus unlisted companies? Because we know that publicly listed companies tend to deliver higher returns on capital, and we also know that unlisted companies—family-owned or state-owned enterprises—tend to play a big role in some Asian economies. I’m wondering if this is also part of the explanation.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Yes. In that sense, our findings for Asia support the global finding or the global trend. Perhaps just more so that [in] listed firms, overall, the ROIC is substantially higher—globally it’s 8.4 percent—than [it is in] unlisted firms, which would be 5.5 percent. That’s a global number.', 'Asia looks very similar: 8.0 percent versus 5.3 percent. I think that that’s absolutely true. The reality is that much of the unlisted firms—the majority of them, in fact—are in China. There’s potentially a particular characteristic of unlisted firms in China versus elsewhere, but it’s in line with the global trend. In fact, if we look at Chinese listed firms as a class, they had the same, more or less, ROIC as North America’s.', 'Chris Bradley: What makes China really unique in this regard is just the scale of that unlisted sector. Just to put it in perspective, there’s about $12 trillion of invested capital in China overall, and a bit over half of that is inside of this unlisted sector, which is just orders of magnitude bigger than [it is in] most other countries. That’s $6.2 trillion of invested capital inside these unlisted Chinese firms; that’s more than the entire capital base of Japan and India combined.', 'We’ve seen this massive global phenomenon. We call it the tsunami of capital that’s hit China and, at a fundamental level, explains a lot of why the economic profit globally has gone, [since] ten years ago, from a fairly healthy $726 billion to now, globally, being minus $34 billion. Your average company is now earning below its cost of capital.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I want to be careful, when we talk about flows and tsunamis and so forth, that, first of all, the Chinese financial system is relatively autarchic. It tends to stay by itself, and foreigners own less than 6 percent of the financial assets in the country. Whatever’s been going on here, it’s been sloshing around pretty much inside the Chinese bathtub.', 'Chris Bradley: Right, it’s not a tsunami coming from somewhere else.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Yeah, so [the] consequences of that mean it’s also going to be largely visited on the Chinese economy. For the beginning of this period—postfinancial recession—we had a massive increase in debt and capital: debt went from 150 percent of GDP to somewhere closer to 250 percent. We’ve really never seen that kind of a rise anywhere else, so there was massive credit.', 'Truth be told, the last three years, the hangover is here, and we’ve been living through deleveraging in China for the last three or four years. That’s stopped, but the expansion did definitely happen. Where it happened was in these, again, value-destroying, capital-intensive sectors of the economy. That’s what took the cash. China’s been spending about 9 percent of its GDP every year on infrastructure. Clearly, as the numbers show, those projects have not been returning their cost of capital.', 'Simon London: Chris, before we go on, I just want to pick up on something you casually dropped into the conversation. You said that the average big company, globally, is now earning below its cost of capital—or, less politely, destroying value. Is that just the impact, on the averages, of what we’re describing here in Asia or are there other factors at work?', 'Chris Bradley: I think [it] reflects the fact that revenue growth is harder and harder to come by, and the world is becoming fundamentally more competitive at a time that the world is actually re-platforming itself. On [the] one hand, in the old world the global renewal of infrastructure [has] been long overdue and needed [but], at the same time, the production system of most companies is completely changing toward a different stack of technology. There’s all these reasons why it’s becoming harder to get incremental revenues at the same time that you’re fundamentally having to re-platform businesses. Taken together, globally, ten years ago, you would need $0.80 of invested capital to earn $1.00 of revenue, whereas today you need almost $1.10 of invested capital to earn that same $1.00 of revenue.', 'The other thing we know about the global balance sheet is that intangible assets are growing at about one-and-a-half times the rate of tangible assets. Even though tangible assets are outstripping revenue growth—so the hard, physical capital is growing faster than revenues—the intangible capital is growing even faster. While the global balance sheet, as I mentioned before, is growing at 8 percent per annum, the intangible part of that balance sheet is growing at 9.2 percent per annum. We are seeing more goodwill from more transactions, more intangible assets, but that doesn’t explain the phenomenon entirely.', 'Simon London: Fascinating, and we should absolutely come back to that on a future podcast. For now, though, let’s segue back to Asia specifically. Give us the good-news story. Where is value being created at scale in Asia? In what countries and in what sectors?', 'Chris Bradley: There’s pockets of enormous value creation in Asia. If we just go by the numbers, we’d highlight that there’s $23 billion of accumulated economic profit in the Japan capital-goods sector, with companies like Hitachi [and] Mitsubishi Heavy in there. The South Korean IT sector, there’s $19 billion of economic profit in there, with companies like Samsung Electronics being an example.', 'The China IT sector, $23 billion of economic profit in there, with household names like Tencent and Alibaba. Notably, actually, the Australian banking sector’s in there, $10 billion of economic profit. It’s been a stable and notably strong performer over the time. Perhaps, controversially, there’s $62 billion of economic profit that’s parked in China financial services. Financial services tends to be a patchy sector across the world in terms of value creation. At least by the reported numbers, China really stands tall there.', 'Simon London: We haven’t mentioned India yet. How are Indian companies doing in aggregate?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: It is certainly, first of all, a growth story. It’s appeared in the Global 5000 at levels much more significant than where it was before. So it’s still relatively small, but it’s on its way—150 companies today with real outperformance in pharma, in IT. On the other hand, [in] some sectors there is this issue of “How are we allocating capital and why doesn’t it get a return?” Financial services stands out, as does the energy and materials sector; [I’m] saying these are areas where, simply, the sector has underperformed its cost of capital. I want to stress that there are still a lot of great-company stories here.', 'When we look at the actual new companies, many of them are newcomers out of India. There is a lot to be talked about—a similar story, perhaps overall, in terms of the level and rate of development in how capital is being allocated. [There is a] different role for the financial-services sector, perhaps, than in other economies, but [there’s] growth and capital intensification, as we’ve seen elsewhere.', 'Simon London: What about mergers and acquisitions involving Asian companies? What are the patterns and trends in M&A if you step back?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: What’s striking is the greater share of the shift of transaction volume toward Asia. Asia has risen from, give or take, 16 percent of transaction volume at the beginning of the period to 31 percent at the close of the period. That’s striking. As to what that transaction volume is, it’s still largely East to East. It’s transactions that are taking place within Asia and, mostly, domestically within countries in Asia. That said, the most rapidly growing portion of the whole thing is, if you will, East to West. That’s growing at 8 percent over the whole period, so it shows that these Asian corporate firms are globally integrating. They’re doing so a bit faster than perhaps might’ve been expected.', 'Chris Bradley: It’s another special callout to Japan as well here too, which has particularly had the lowest share of M&A that’s domestically focused. In fact, more than half of M&A in Japan is outbound. Newspaper headlines—stuff like Takeda buying out Shire, for example—this is kind of happening all the time with Japan. As we see, Japanese companies both get a bit more confident but also get a bit more realistic about how to create value in a long-term deflationary environment.', 'Simon London: I’m conscious that we’ve been talking at quite a high level. Lots of numbers, trends, and so on, which is good, but before we run out of time, I want to make sure we bring it down to a level that’s actionable. Chris, let’s start with you. For executives or policy makers listening to this, what are the takeaways?', 'Chris Bradley: I think there’s three things, Simon. The first one is this is a great reminder that the fundamental question that CEOs face in their strategy is where to compete. Because we see that, fundamentally, you can tell two-thirds of the story based on sector capital allocation. At a macro level, that means making sure the institutions are in place to get capital flowing to the right places. At a micro level, it means getting resource allocation right within a company.', 'The second message, I think, is this idea that Asia’s overrepresented in the bottom-quintile firms—that set of firms that disproportionately destroy economic value. I think for policy makers and for CEOs in those sectors, there’s really a question of “OK, what’s it going to take? What conditions have to be in place to get to cost of capital here? What kind of industry rationalization, what kind of performance-improvement programs, do we need to really clean up that bottom quintile?”', 'The third one is, “Well, you know what? There’s actually a lot of green spots in Asia. There’s a lot of places where Asia is proving itself to be globally competitive. How do we double down on that? How do we make the greens even bigger greens?” I think there’s some of the big takeaways that I would look at.', 'Simon London: Jonathan, anything to add there?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Yeah, I would certainly agree with Chris that the green spots for sure [exist]—I think that’s what is interesting about this Asian environment. When we look at the top performers, Why are they there? What are the things that allow them, in this very skewed picture, to stay at the top and to rise to the top? That, I think, is an interesting story that we want to do more research on.', 'When we step back from the broader picture, I think it’s clear that this is a region in transition. With that transition, there is [a] risk that we have a very substantial portion of Asian corporate economies, which are, let’s just say, under water or they’re paddling vigorously. There is a liquidity challenge for a lot of these companies that are not returning their cost of capital, and so their existence is fundamentally dependent on the willingness of the providers of capital to continue to do so.', 'That is a risk, and I think it’s a macro risk, and it’s one that every investor and every competitor should take into account, as they’re operating in Asia. That said, this is a region in progress. We see that capital intensification being supported by and resulting in economic growth. Watch the space. It’s going to be very exciting one way or the other.', 'Simon London: I think we are indeed out of time for today. Chris and Jonathan, I know you both need to run, but thanks so much for a fascinating conversation.', 'Chris Bradley: Thanks, Simon.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Thanks. Thanks, Simon.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you our listeners for tuning in to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

52,The future of air travel,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-future-of-air-travel,Airlines and passengers alike are flying into a world of flygskam and flying taxis.,"['Airlines and passengers alike are flying into a world of flygskam and flying taxis.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partner Alex Dichter and partner Robin Riedel about the economics of the airline industry.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. In this first episode of 2020, we are going to be talking about the present, and future, of air travel. On the one hand, these are exciting times for aviation. The airline industry is enjoying an all-too-rare period of healthy profits, and there is very real potential in new modes of air travel, ranging from unmanned air taxis to next-generation supersonic planes.', 'And yet there is increasing awareness, among passengers and policy makers, that flying is a carbon-intensive mode of transportation. The concept of flygskam, roughly translated from the Swedish as “flight shame,” is a topic of conversation in the media and in boardrooms alike.   To discuss all this and more, I caught up with a couple of commercial pilots turned McKinsey partners. Alex Dichter is American, now based in London; Robin Riedel is German, now based in San Francisco. They both work extensively with airlines and, like many of us, fly extensively for work.', 'Alex and Robin, thank you for being here and welcome to the podcast.', 'Robin Riedel: Glad to be here.', 'Alex Dichter: Great to be here.', 'Simon London: Let’s start with a little bit of industry economics. This industry is famous—has been famous over the years—for destroying value for investors. But the last few years have been better. Alex, just tell us what’s changed?', 'Alex Dichter: Sure. We are indeed about to finish the fifth year of consecutive profitability in the airline industry, depending on how you measure it. The industry’s made a small economic profit in each of the last five years. Certainly, no matter how you measure it, it’s been the most profitable five-year period in 80 years of industry history.', 'Some of that, to be clear, is good luck. We’ve had relatively robust GDP growth across the world, and certainly in the US, over that period. Fuel prices have been lower than average. But I do think that there are some things that the airline industry has figured out that are working better. Chief among them would be what the industry refers to as ancillary revenues.', 'To illustrate the point, in a typical year over the last five years, the industry as a whole has made an economic profit of, let’s say, $35 billion. In any of those same years, the global sales of ancillary revenue—[for] seat assignments, bag fees, credit-card fees—has been north of $50 billion. In other words, you could say that all of the industry profit is coming from ancillaries. Of course, it’s a bit more complicated than that, but it is a big structural change and it’s really helping the industry.', 'Simon London: It’s interesting. It’s like the biggest innovation in the airline industry over the last ten years or so actually has been revenue management, or pricing innovation, as opposed to fancy new aircraft.', 'Alex Dichter: I don’t want to discount the impact of fancy new aircraft. Certainly, as a pilot, those are very important to me. But, yes, it’s a big structural change and, by the way, it’s one that the airline industry didn’t invent. It used to be that we all paid for our checking accounts. Today, the checking account tends to be free and we pay a little bit extra for physical checks, a little bit extra for this, a little bit extra for that. It’s true in telecoms. It’s true in many other industries. What the industry is doing is responding to human behavior.', 'People are less responsive to changes in these fees than they are to changes in the price of the ticket. When the price of the ticket goes up by a dollar or two, airlines see an immediate effect in their demand. When we change the seat-assignment fee from $6 to $7 or $7 to $8, people may buy fewer seat assignments but they don’t buy fewer tickets. From an industry-structure standpoint, that’s probably a healthier way of building revenue rather than simply bundling everything into the ticket price.', 'Robin Riedel: I think what Alex said is absolutely right, and then I would add that, operationally, we’ve seen massive progress. They’re using aircraft a lot more than they have in the past and spreading the cost of those aircraft. At the same [time], crews are much more productive than they have been in the past. [For] all kinds of different cost items, we’ve found ways, over the last decade or so, to significantly reduce [them].', 'Simon London: This is where I’m going to put my traveler hat on. Is there a sense then, Robin, that this little profitable spell for the industry has been somewhat … passengers are paying for it? It feels like I do have to pay for a lot of things I never used to have to pay for. Plus, I have crowded airports, crowded planes. I think the traveler experience doesn’t feel like a great one at the moment.', 'Robin Riedel: It’s an interesting observation. I do think if you look at the data, it would tell a bit of a different story, a more nuanced story. I think there’s lots of positives that are better today than they were before. I think, on the one hand, you have more choice.', 'You say things are more crowded. You may pay for more things, but it’s actually your choice to do so. If you want the fantastic experience, you can pay for that and actually get it. You can get lie-flat seats, which 20 years ago you couldn’t. You can get great airport lounges. You can get fast track. You can even get private terminals in certain places.', 'All of that is available. Now, overall, costs have come down. If you could look at the real cost of air travel over the years, this is one of the only industries in the world where prices continuously go down and down and down. Today, access to air travel is a multiple of what we had even ten or 20 years ago, simply because airlines have figured out how to lower costs over time, which provides access to people.', 'Now, on top of that, beyond the choice and beyond some of the innovation we’re seeing, there’s a couple of simple things that have just gotten better. One is on-time performance. We’re so much better today in understanding weather patterns, understanding equipment, having much more reliable equipment. While it might sometimes feel like you’re stuck in the airport longer than in the past, the facts would actually show a different story.', 'Alex Dichter: Robin pointed out the benefits if you’re interested in a premium experience. But, quite frankly, even in economy class, the vast majority of the global airline fleet has inflight entertainment, often with hundreds of movies and TV shows to choose from. There’s Wi-Fi on board, sometimes for a fee, sometimes not. There are extra-legroom seats that you can pay for, at reasonable prices that a lot of people choose to pay for and can afford.', 'I think a lot of people who refer to the golden age of air travel don’t remember what flying was like in the ’60s and ’70s. I do. I did a lot of it. Fights were long, deadly boring. There was smoking on airplanes, which a lot of people don’t like. The connections were very difficult. You always had to leave the terminal. Lots of waiting in lines. You couldn’t do anything digitally. It wasn’t quite the experience that people remember it to be. I think the one thing that is clearly more difficult today is that planes are full.', 'The average load factor—the percentage of seats that had people in them—in the 1970s was around 60 percent, which meant that you were almost certainly, mathematically, going to get an empty seat next to you. Today, as anyone knows, getting an empty seat next to you on a typical flight is a real rarity.', 'Simon London: Yeah, and airports are more crowded as well, though, aren’t they? There is a fact, isn’t there, around the number of airports, globally, which are operating at or beyond capacity—and it’s high, right?', 'Robin Riedel: They’re more crowded. Now, the way it really manifests itself is security. If you go back to the ’60s or ’70s, there was no security, and so it was a much more open space. Today, once you’re through security, the airport experience is generally pretty good. You have restaurants. You have retail shopping. You have lots of seating space. You have light terminals with lots of window space. Security tends to be the number-one pain point for passengers going through the experience.', 'Simon London: Yes, and I guess we cannot blame that on the airlines. That’s not something the airlines chose to put in place.', 'Alex Dichter: But you’re quite right about the crowding point. If you go to multiple airline terminals, particularly in hub markets today, during peak hours you’ll find that it can be difficult to move around. In an industry that grows at, depending on the market, 3 to 6 percent per year, it’s very clear that much of that infrastructure needs to be expanded and/or replaced and needs to be expanded or replaced quite quickly.', 'Simon London: Yeah. Just go back to legroom, which is always a topic of much debate.', 'Alex Dichter: Yep.', 'Simon London: It feels to me like legroom is probably less than it used to be. Again, am I just looking at the past through rose-tinted spectacles?', 'Alex Dichter: Here are the facts. Let’s go back to the ’70s. I think in the ’70s, the average pitch—this is a term that the industry uses for the number of inches or centimeters between one point on a seat and the exact same point on the seat behind it or in front of it—was about 34 inches. Today, if we looked at most network carriers, traditional airlines, it’s probably in the neighborhood of 31 inches. So that’s three inches fewer, which sounds like a lot. However, the seats are slimmer. A typical seat today is at least two inches slimmer than it was in the 1970s, so the amount of space available for your legs is not dramatically different.', 'Simon London: So we might have lost an inch over a few decades.', 'Alex Dichter: We might have lost an inch. I think we certainly lost some recline. I think fuller airplanes mean that we’re a little less socially comfortable reclining our seats, and that’s certainly had an impact. Let’s be clear: this [legroom] is also one of those things that people say they want, and yet, to the industry’s chagrin, there doesn’t seem to be an enormous amount of evidence that people are willing to pay for it or shift their preferences because of it.', 'Simon London: So as consumers, we do not vote with our feet or our knees.', 'Alex Dichter: Unfortunately, that is true. I think the happy equilibrium we’re coming to is [that] many airlines are offering extra-legroom seats. There are different names for these. There’s, of course, premium economy, which is sold as a separate class. In many cases, for anywhere from $20 to $100, you can buy an extra-legroom seat, which has quite a bit of additional legroom. So those who care can buy, and those who care less don’t.', 'Simon London: Yeah. So the golden age of air travel [was] maybe not quite as true as we’d like to remember. Let’s go back to this little golden period we’ve [now] got of industry economics, though. Will it continue?', 'Alex Dichter: The dynamics that have always led to unprofitability in this industry are fundamentally still there. This is still an industry that orders lots of airplanes when it’s doing well. Those airplanes show up two to three years later, typically all at the same time. And that drives quite a bit of cyclicality.', 'Simon London: The cyclicality of capacity planning and the fact that every airline seems to order in unison, and then you get excess capacity, is just a fundamental problem.', 'Alex Dichter: Sure. Fundamental problem. The fact [is] that capacity is perishable—meaning when a seat leaves the gate, it’s worth nothing. The marginal cost to put one more passenger on the airplane is very low, and that leads to a very strong incentive, and a rational one, to price below full cost when times are tough. In an industry where prices are relatively transparent, others respond, and you end up in a bit of a spiral.', 'Simon London: Yeah. Yeah.', 'Alex Dichter: I don’t think any of that has fundamentally changed.', 'Robin Riedel: I would maybe add that there are a few new storm clouds on the horizon here for the industry. One of the bigger ones has got to be the question of sustainability. I think we’re hearing lots of public outcry about the amount of carbon that aviation puts in the air. If you look at other emissions, it’s even higher than that. There’s a real question about whether demand is going to change because of environmental concerns.', 'Simon London: Yes. There’s the word flygskam; I’m probably butchering that. We’ll get letters from Sweden! This came up just in the last year or so and seems to have entered popular culture. Is this actually a real topic of conversation—again, at the capacity-planning level? When people are looking at the demand curve and thinking about orders in airlines, are they taking this into account?', 'Robin Riedel: They’re starting to. I think this is a relatively new trend. We’re seeing this over the last six months or so, but our surveys have shown that about one-third of the passengers are seriously considering flying less as a result of environmental concerns, which is something we haven’t seen before at this number.', 'We do see [this] in certain markets. In Scandinavia, we see pockets of demand falling off, especially domestic travel or short-term travel, as a result of this. We’re seeing lots and lots of airlines starting to come out with very bold messages around what they want to do. Right now, a lot of this is focused on how do we increase fuel efficiency with our flying? How do we think about alternative fuels—certifying them and getting them on board? How do we think about offsets?', 'But to be honest, there’s a lot more to be done, and there’s a real challenge for the industry coming up. Because of the density of power that sits in fuel, it’s very hard to go to other sources. Going to electric is incredibly hard for longer flights, if not physically impossible at this point.', 'Simon London: Just because of the density of batteries per unit of energy that they contain?', 'Robin Riedel: That’s exactly right. The problem is, other industries can go with alternatives. We’re going to look at electric cars and we’re going to see that ramp up. Even though aviation might be 2 percent, 2.5 percent, of carbon emissions today, aviation is rapidly growing compared to other modes and other polluters and doesn’t have as many alternatives. As the other modes put alternatives in, we will see the [carbon-emissions] number of aviation come up quite a bit. It’s not crazy to say ten years from now, aviation could be at 10 percent.', 'Simon London: It’s currently at this interesting data point. Currently, around 2 percent, 2.5 percent, of global carbon emissions are [from] aviation, and probably, on trends, that will rise. How far it will rise, we don’t know, but it could rise significantly.', 'Robin Riedel: That’s right.', 'Simon London: Presumably, the industry is heavily incented to get more fuel efficient because jet fuel is a significant portion of costs. What’s the record of the industry so far? Beyond the cleaner-fuel alternatives or biofuels, what’s the industry doing to try and reduce it?', 'Alex Dichter: It’s something that’s on everyone’s mind. I think even if you weren’t concerned about carbon, to your point, fuel is a large expense item, and everyone’s looking to use less of it. Certainly, for some airlines, that means investing in new aircraft types that are significantly more fuel efficient. Some of the new-generation aircraft are as much as 20 percent more efficient on a per-passenger basis.', 'Let’s be clear: those airplanes are expensive. If you look at most cases, it’s a clear business case, but it’s close—meaning you save a lot on operating costs, but you pay back quite a bit of that in capital costs for the privilege of having new aircraft. For some, that makes sense. For others, it makes less sense.', 'Robin Riedel: Maybe to add a few things to that, the record of the industry at reducing or increasing fuel efficiency has actually been quite good. On average, we’re seeing about a percent, 1.5 percent, of reduction per year. Every year.', 'The airlines are quite committed to that, to Alex’s point, because it saves them money. I think one of the big players that has the opportunity to do more is actually air-traffic control here, and this is in many cases government led. [We need] better ways to utilize the airspace, finding better ways to hand off between—for example, in Europe—between country-based air-traffic control and allowing aircraft to take more direct flights, staying at an altitude where they’re more fuel efficient for longer. That could make a big difference. I think there’s a lot of opportunity left to really see some improvement on the fuel efficiency.', 'Simon London: Yeah. To step back from that, even though consumers say they are concerned about the environmental impact of flying, we still expect the industry to be growing at GDP-plus for the next while. If it bends the demand curve, it’s going to be at the margin.', 'Alex Dichter: I think we do need to consider a scenario in which that changes. I think the fact is that a reasonably large portion of air travel today is discretionary. In Europe—I live in the UK—for a lot of people, the choice to go to Amsterdam or Spain for the weekend is an alternative to going to a football game and going to the pub, at not very different costs. It’s a way of spending your time. One of the airline CEOs in Europe says that his biggest competitor is the sofa, meaning that he’s really trying to get people to get out of their homes and decide to travel. And that creates demand. I think the notion of flygskam and, again, I’m sure I’m pronouncing it incorrectly …', 'Simon London: I think you did better than I did!', 'Alex Dichter: … is precisely to challenge people on that type of travel. I think if that mind-set becomes widespread, we could see a big change to demand. Businesses, too, while we as businesspeople think that much of our travel is essential, I think if we really looked at it with a sharp eye, we’d realize much of it could be replaced by videoconferencing and phone calls. I think that there is the possibility that we’ll see large changes in mind-sets toward travel, and that’s something that the industry needs to watch very closely.', 'Robin Riedel: Just to build on that, I think the same is true for cargo. If you look at air cargo today, a lot of it is perishable goods. Anywhere in the world you can get nonseasonal fruit and vegetables. You can get salmon from Chile and you can get flowers. You can get perishable goods from all over the world at any time. I think consumers will over time smarten up to that and say …', 'Simon London: … “what is the carbon footprint of my strawberries?”', 'Robin Riedel: Yeah. There you go.', 'Simon London: Alex, you mentioned a little earlier that the current-generation and next-generation aircraft are more fuel efficient. Without getting too nerdy, but I’m interested, how is that being achieved?', 'Alex Dichter: In the simplest form, much of that benefit is coming through an increase in what engine manufacturers refer to as the bypass ratio. That’s, effectively, the ratio of thrust that is created by the fan. That’s the big disc out in front of the engine that you see spinning. It’s effectively a propeller, versus the core of the engine.', 'The higher the bypass ratio, the more efficient the engine is, up to a point. It’s a very simple explanation of a very complicated topic. I think the issue is we’re up against a threshold where dramatic increases in bypass ratios are not likely, for two reasons. One is at some point the fan becomes so big that you can’t manage it geometrically. The second point is that the internal temperature of the engine goes up with higher bypass ratios. At some point, we run into the limits of the ability for materials to sustain those temperatures.', 'Simon London: So we hit a plateau of what you can get out of the technology.', 'Alex Dichter: At some point, physics wins. I think that the achievements of the engine manufacturers over the last 20 or 30 years have been remarkable. I think engineers do wonderful things and we’ll continue to see improvements. But I think the idea that we’ll at some point see a kerosene-driven, high-bypass-ratio turbofan engine that burns 50 percent less fuel than we see today, using the same basic concepts, strikes most of us as unlikely.', 'Robin Riedel: Then to build on that, I think the changes we would see in that next-generation aircraft will be new airframe designs. I think on the airframe side, we’re getting more aerodynamic wings. We’re building more aerodynamic fuselages overall, and we’re building lighter materials. There are a lot of carbon aircraft parts out there now.', 'Simon London: Yes. There are composites and things being built which are lighter than aluminum and so on.', 'Robin Riedel: That’s right, but we’re fundamentally still building the same kind of tube and wing designs that we’ve been building for the last 80, 90 years. The question is [that] to get to the next level of efficiency afterward, we’ll have to attack the design of the actual aircraft.', 'There are designs out there like blended wing bodies, which have significantly better lift performance and lower drag, that would achieve the next step change, but it’s not as easy as just taking an engine off, like we do today, and replacing it. As an industry where a new aircraft design will easily cost you more than $10 billion, something of that scale will probably cost you $30 billion, $40 billion. We haven’t gotten to the point yet to really invest in these new designs.', 'Simon London: Presumably, as an aircraft manufacturer, the big hairy bet that you have to make is when to take those kinds of more futuristic designs—next-generation or beyond-next-generation platforms—into production.', 'Alex Dichter: I think there are multiple considerations. I think one is you don’t want to kill the existing platform, which still has plenty of growth left in it. You’re trying to pay down that investment, which might be only five or ten years old. The second is you want to make those investments at points in which propulsion technology is ready for a step change.', 'Last but not least, there is something to be said for managing the number of unknown unknowns in a design. The good news about reusing existing design features is that they’re very well tested. We understand them. We understand how to make them safe or safer. We understand how to build them. The more unknowns there are, the more uncertainty you have in the development process that leads to delays. It leads to manufacturing problems. Eventually, the industry tends to get there, but it can be a bumpy road.', 'Robin Riedel: Notwithstanding what we said, there are some very good ideas on the horizon that are actually coming to fruition in the smaller-aircraft space. We’re looking at electric propulsion. The floatplane companies in Vancouver have committed to going fully electric on their smaller aircraft.', 'There we see a bunch of innovations coming out that are electric propulsion, battery driven. On the next horizon of range, you have a bunch of new designs that have distributive propulsion. Instead of having one or two big engines on the aircraft, you have dozens of small, little propellers across the wing or across the fuselage, which have all kinds of aerodynamic benefits. While we won’t see that any time soon on the large airliners that we travel around [on] most of the time, we will see this on the smaller, regional aircraft.', 'Simon London: So the innovation tends to be on the shorter haul, basically?', 'Alex Dichter: I wouldn’t say it has been a pattern that innovation occurs on the shorter haul. I think the point is that when it comes to electric aircraft, the ability to do something that’s economically useful on short-haul aircraft today is in sight in a way that it is not for long-range aircraft. We’re not far away from being able to pack enough energy into a battery to be able to carry ten passengers 20 or 30 kilometers. We’re quite some way away from being able to carry 300 passengers 10,000 kilometers.', 'Simon London: Just talk a little bit about the air-taxi concept, which sounds incredibly futuristic. What do you think? Is it realistic?', 'Robin Riedel: It’s a space I’m tremendously excited about. Right now, we track more than 150 different manufacturers working on prototypes and business models around these vehicles.', 'Simon London: One hundred and fifty?', 'Robin Riedel: More than 150 just from the manufacturing-the-vehicle side. If you think of the whole ecosystem, it’s many, many more than that. You will have to recharge these vehicles. You will need infrastructure to land them. You need air-traffic control when you think about the lower airspace and lots of vehicles; it’s something that today doesn’t exist.', 'All of that is being spun up right now. There are dozens of companies that have working prototypes that fly with and without passengers, with and without pilots, today and are proving that technology-wise, we’re actually there.', 'Now, at the same [time], there are a lot of unlocks that need to happen to get there. Air-traffic control is one I mentioned. The thought that we will have dozens of these [air taxis] zipping through a city—it’s a problem that, technically maybe, we’re close to solving or have solved.', 'Simon London: Yes, it’s both exciting and scary.', 'Robin Riedel: It is both exciting and scary. Now, public perception is another issue. I think in the Western world, our surveys suggest that people are not quite ready to get into an autonomous plastic bowl with rotors on it and fly around a city, or there’s some skepticism around it. Now, in some of the emerging markets, there’s less of a concern there.', 'Simon London: You guys are both pilots. Will these things be pilotless or not? Because, presumably, the weight of the pilot, the economics of the pilot, fundamentally changes the game.', 'Robin Riedel: Let me give you a couple of the data points here. By adding a pilot, we’re about doubling the cost of flying on these vehicles. That’s because you have to pay for the pilot, for one, which isn’t necessarily cheap, especially if you only share the cost over a couple of passengers, versus a couple of hundred on big aircraft. Secondly, you’re designing the aircraft for the pilot to be in there. If you add an extra seat, that’s extra weight, so you’re roughly doubling the cost of the trip.', 'I think, secondly, it’s an interesting question of where these pilots will come from and how we incentivize them. Our forecasts show that by 2027, 2030, if this industry takes off, we’ll need about 50,000 pilots just for this urban air-mobility space. The value proposition for them is an interesting one because you’re telling them, “Listen. We want you to fly these,” but at the same time, as an industry, our number-one priority is to …', 'Simon London: … to get rid of you!', 'Robin Riedel: To get rid of you. To automate this, so that we can bring down the cost. If you think about the NPV [net present value] of a pilot’s career, you invest about $100,000 up front to get your pilot’s license. You spend two years of your life doing that. You have to recoup that afterward. If you only think about a five- or ten-year career until you get automated away, it’s a hard pitch to make. It’s a very interesting question for the industry how to resolve it.', 'Alex Dichter: The other thing I’d say is that we are very close to being able to master the technology that’s required for 100 percent–safe autonomous flight. Ninety-nine-point-something percent of the time, everything goes flawlessly.', 'That said, you see in your day-to-day life that technology fails, whether that’s having to reboot your computer or your phone. This happens on airplanes today—sometimes you need to reboot a system and have human intervention. Not surprisingly, the tolerance for technology failures in unmanned flight will be zero. The question in a lot of people’s minds is, “All right. If we’re 99-point-something percent of the way there, how far are we from 100?” That could be very close, and it could be very, very far.', 'Simon London: This is the same discussion that happens with autonomous vehicles. To what standard do we hold the systems? Do we hold them to the standard of perfection, or do we hold them to a human standard, which is a long way from even 99.99 percent?', 'Robin Riedel: You raise an interesting point there because the human standard is also not 100 percent. In a lot of cases, you would argue the human introduces a certain amount of risk as well because there’s human failure and human error. I think a lot of it is a public-perception issue, and how do we deal with the fact that we’re expecting 100 percent safety from aviation but yet we’re totally fine getting in a car and taking a significant risk on our way to the airport in the car.', 'Simon London: It’s cultural, societal, but also regulatory, and regulators will respond to politicians, who respond to societies. What about supersonic? Is there a future? Is it going to come back?', 'Alex Dichter: Many people my age had a chance to fly on Concorde when it was operating, and it was a wonderful experience. There are a couple of companies that have very credible paths, from a technology standpoint, to reintroduce supersonic aircraft—in some cases, to the business and corporate market.', 'That said, I do think that there are some real challenges. First and foremost, [supersonic aircraft] will not be more fuel efficient. I think that in a world where we become very focused on carbon footprints, at an individual as well as a collective level, that may impede the success of these models.', 'I think, second, there is a time-channel problem with supersonic flight that I think many people underestimate. What I mean by that is, nobody wants to arrive at 2:00 in the morning and nobody wants to leave at 2:00 in the morning. When you look at the rational departure and arrival time slots in many city pairs, supersonic does wonderful things for you in some city pairs and does nothing for you in others.', 'Concorde, for instance, was quite popular between London or Paris and New York, and it was less popular in the other direction because it left in the morning and arrived in the early evening, so you spent a day on an airplane. Whereas the alternative would be to spend a full day in New York, go to sleep in a first-class seat or a business-class seat—because if you were on Concorde, that’s probably your alternative—wake up in Europe, and have a productive day on the other end. That said, I suspect we will see some activity in this space at small scale.', 'Simon London: Let’s just finish with some tips. You are both pilots and frequent travelers. I’m sure you get asked this at dinner parties, so here’s the dinner-party question: “I fly. What should I do? What should I not do?”', 'Alex Dichter: My simple answer is, unless you really have to, don’t eat on planes. Nothing against the food. It’s fine. But in many cases, the flight is relatively short. If you look at the East Coast of the US to Europe, you have, at best, six and a half hours in the air. You have a big time-zone change ahead of you. Getting even a few hours’ sleep is really helpful, and an hour and a half worth of dinner, whether you’re in economy or business [class], takes away a significant portion of your sleeping time. Not to mention the fact that the airplane is a pressurized environment. Without getting into overly biotechnical details, your body doesn’t do a particularly good job of digesting food at altitude.', 'Simon London: Yeah. So rest, basically. Put your head down. Get some rest. Don’t eat. Robin, any tips?', 'Robin Riedel: Well, I still eat on airplanes, so I don’t quite agree [with Alex] on that one. I think getting smart on a stress-free way through the airport and through the environment is really what I spend my time thinking about, and that’s the tip I give people. Think about which security checkpoint you use. Is there a way for you to get faster through that by registering for a program or by being a frequent flyer? [Also,] understanding where the gate layout is, what are the right places to refresh or [where] the washrooms [are] in the area, et cetera.', 'Simon London: So a little bit of preplanning of the airport experience.', 'Robin Riedel: A little bit of preplanning of the airport experience. Absolutely. I think on the aircraft itself, I would argue get a window seat if you can, because you can lean against the window. People always argue that the person who’s in the aisle seat has all the power because they can get up whenever they want. Well, the reality is, if you’re in the window seat, you can also get up whenever you want, and you can actually make the other people get up at the same time. That whole aisle argument for me doesn’t count. For me, it’s a window seat.', 'Alex Dichter: One other tip that might surprise you is pack lightly, as that not only simplifies your life and makes dragging bags through the airport simpler but also reduces your carbon footprint. If you choose not to fly, at least in the short term that seat will probably be filled by someone else and, certainly, the plane will go. Every kilogram that you remove from your personal luggage reduces the fuel burn for the aircraft. I feel good about that. It also makes my life simpler.', 'Robin Riedel: One other [tip] I would add is bring a pillow. Even on shorter flights, being able to rest your head on something other than just the headrest is nice. I always carry a small pillow with me. I carry a pair of somewhat nicer eyeshades than you are given for free. Because that just makes a big difference to me—to be able to shut out the light and get a little bit of quiet time.', 'Alex Dichter: Another key one for me is knowing when not to sleep. The big challenge of long-haul travel, of course, is managing jet lag. That is as much a question of learning how to sleep as it is [of] knowing when not to sleep. A perfect example would be [that] a typical flight from the East Coast of the United States to Asia would leave in the middle of the day—let’s say noon—and arrive in Asia late in the afternoon, which, by the way, would be early in the morning on your body time.', 'If I look around the airplane, in most cases I would see people asleep for the last five hours of that flight. I know from experience that those people will end up tossing and turning in their hotel bed that night, unable to go to sleep again. That sets a pattern, throughout the subsequent days, of being groggy in the day, probably having to resort to taking a nap, and not being able to sleep at night. Keeping yourself awake so that you can shock yourself into the next time zone is an important discipline in managing jet lag.', 'Be friendly to airport and airline employees. There are a lot of things that go wrong in the airline industry, and the vast majority of them are not the fault of the flight attendant or gate agent that you are speaking to. Taking the time to smile and acknowledge that it’s not their fault, and [for them to] have a little human contact, makes their day better, makes your day better, and, again, creates that positive loop that we were talking about. I had a flight attendant come up to me not long ago to thank me for taking my headsets off of my head when she came to ask me a question. You would think that would be a common courtesy; it’s something I ask my kids to do but, apparently, that’s not something that’s often done. Those little things make a difference.', 'Simon London: We are out of time for today. Robin, Alex, thank you so much for joining and that was fascinating.', 'Alex Dichter: Great.', 'Robin Riedel: Thank you for the time.', 'Alex Dichter: We’ll see you all in an airport someplace.', 'Simon London: Yeah.

Today, we’re going to be talking about gold: as a commodity, as a financial asset, and most of all, as an industry. Now, you might imagine that digging gold out of the ground would be easy money. Far from it. For one thing, the gold price is extremely volatile; for another, mining companies are having to look harder—and dig deeper—to find new deposits. They’re also under increasing pressure to minimize carbon emissions and environmental impact.', 'For this conversation about the complex economics of the gold sector, I spoke with McKinsey partner Oliver Ramsbottom, who’s based in Hong Kong, and knowledge expert Greg Callaway, who’s based in Johannesburg. Oliver and Greg, thanks so much for joining, and welcome to the podcast.', 'Greg Callaway: Great to be here.', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: Thank you very much. Happy to talk about gold, one of my favorite commodities.', 'Simon London: For those of us who aren’t close to the industry, maybe we should start with a little bit of scene setting. Oliver, maybe tell us the story of the last few years. What’s been happening to the gold price, and how have gold-mining companies responded?', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: If you look at the gold industry over the past 20 years, it’s been a roller-coaster ride. We had gold prices around $250 per ounce—that was April 2001—rising to a peak of around $1,900 per ounce in September 2011. Then after that period, a dramatic fall in prices.', 'If you look at the industry over these periods—so the 2000s and then up to 2010—it’s been very different behavior. During the 2000s, as gold prices increased, this led to a dramatic increase in the amount of acquisitions that were being done: around 1,000 deals, with a combined value of about $120 billion, CEOs paying premiums of 30 percent and above, and a lot of capital projects being announced—around $125 billion worth—the majority of these exceeding budgets by some significant margin.', 'Then of course, we have the crash in gold prices in 2011. And as a result, many companies found that they had balance sheets that were overlevered, cost structures that were bloated. This led to a dramatic period of cost-out initiatives, paying down debt, firing of exploration teams, et cetera. Also, a lot of castigation from shareholders who felt that, during this period of price fly ups, the industry CEOs and management teams had destroyed shareholder value.', 'This roller-coaster ride has continued through today. Gold prices are starting to rise, and many management teams are thinking, “Is the industry now poised for growth? What should be our strategy moving forward?”', 'Simon London: The companies have repaired themselves financially, the gold price is on the up again, and the question in the boardrooms is, “Where do we go from here?”', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: Exactly. Shareholders are saying, “Have management teams learned the lessons from the past?” If you look at the industry today, it’s in a much healthier condition. Hence, people are now saying it’s ready for growth.', 'Shareholders are still quite frustrated because they look back at that period of massive M&A and, frankly, shareholder destruction. Many of the shareholders, the hedge funds, are saying, “Look, we don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past,” and are warning CEOs. As a result, many CEOs and management teams are somewhat wary about following that previous course of M&A in order to achieve growth, notwithstanding several large acquisitions that have happened over the past six months.', 'Simon London: Before we double click on what the companies could and should be doing going forward, let’s just talk a little bit about the gold price. Now, as you said at the beginning, we were down at $250 an ounce in the late ’90s, early 2000s. It went as high as $1,900 an ounce, sort of by 2011, halved back down again to about $1,000 an ounce, and that went back up to $1,500 an ounce. It is an incredibly volatile business environment in which to try and operate. What drives prices through these wild swings?', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: It’s a great question, and it’s one we’re being asked a lot at the moment. People are asking us, what’s our forecast on gold price? But actually, what sets gold price? How is it actually derived?', 'It’s a very interesting question because many people say, unlike typical commodities that have their prices driven by simple supply and demand balances, gold is different. It’s a financial commodity. As a result, those typical relationships of supply and demand don’t really apply.', 'Our view is more nuanced. We actually think it’s a reflection not only of supply and demand but also of macroeconomic factors. On the one hand, you have traditional demand in the form of jewelry, in the form of industrial applications. You have financial demand in terms of people putting their assets into ETFs [exchange-traded funds], financial coins, and then obviously, central-bank purchases, as well.', 'It’s those two different factors that play in—that help drive the gold price. We’ve certainly seen that over the past two or so years, where you’ve seen gold prices react to movements in the interest rate by the Fed [Federal Reserve Board] and also gold prices move notably up on the back of economic uncertainty, be it around the US economy, be it around the Middle East—or the geopolitical environment.', 'Greg Callaway: I think what’s really interesting about gold prices, if you look historically—and we’ve run the analysis over the last 50 years—is when, in real-dollar terms, gold prices hit around $1,700 per ounce, both in the early 1980s as well as in the early 2000s. These were periods of incredible stress within the global economy.', 'The 1980s followed the first oil crisis in 1974 and then the second in 1980. This drove hyperinflation. The stories of people queuing for kilometers on end in the US are widely told. Similarly, if we move to 2011, what really drove prices up here were the negative yields and low interest rates—in many cases negative. It’s typically when you see those stress factors coming through, and it’s not necessarily the same ones at a particular point in time that move prices up.', 'As investors look for new investments, away from equities and bonds, they tend to move into gold as a safe haven.', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: I think there’s just one other factor that we think is going to be interesting to monitor moving forward, which is dedollarization. We’re aware that, over the past 50 or so years, the dollar has been the reserve currency, and the commodities have been priced in dollars.', 'What we’re seeing, potentially, is a move to dedollarize the global economy. We think that that’s going to increase the role that gold has: maybe not moving back to a gold standard but certainly having a larger role to play, which we think would be positive for gold prices.', 'Simon London: Okay, so let’s segue back to the companies. They’ve been on this roller-coaster ride—partly to do with the gold price, partly of their own making, to a degree, as well—just coming out of a period of retrenchment and cost cutting now. If you look forward, what are the big challenges that they’re facing today? What are the conversations going on in the boardrooms?', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: I think there are two challenges.', 'The first of these is just about productivity improvements. Again, if you look back over the past five to seven years, the gold industry was all about taking cost out of the business structure, deleveraging the balance sheet. That has broadly been achieved. Many of the mining companies and gold-company management teams are saying, “What’s going to drive the next wave in productivity?” Our belief is that it has to come from digital—the use of advanced analytics, digital capabilities, to further streamline and further optimize processes, cost structures, et cetera.', 'The second issue that the gold companies are facing is really about reserves. It’s a classic conundrum in the mining industry: you’re obviously producing from your reserves, so you need to continue to build reserves in order to keep production at the same levels or to increase it.', 'What we’ve seen in the mining industry—in the gold industry, in particular—over the past five to seven years is, as exploration budgets and investment into exploration were cut, mining companies were basically digging into or exhausting their existing reserves. What we see today is that the reserves that they have on their books are around 25 percent lower than they were back in 2012—and, in reality, are at 2007 levels. In simple terms, cutting back on exploration over the short term is creating a problem for the long term.', 'Simon London: Is this really a function of just spending less on exploration? Or is there a sense here of, like, the easy gold fields have been found, and it’s just become harder to find big fields?', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: This is very interesting. If you look at the historical track record of exploration, what we saw was, between the 1970s and 1990s, it was really a golden age for exploration. There was at least one $50 million-ounce gold-deposit discovery each decade and at least ten $30 million-ounce deposit discoveries.', 'What we’ve seen since the 2000s is that discovery find rate has really dropped off. In fact, the industry has failed to find any $50 million-ounce and above deposits or, indeed, $30 million-ounce and above deposits. What we’re seeing is that it’s getting harder and harder to find these significant gold reserves and deposits.', 'Greg Callaway: I think the industry went through a structural change in the 2000s in which companies learned that the return on investment when looking for these greenfield projects was significantly low and pushed much of that burden to junior explorers. Junior explorers with tight funding—particularly when you see downward pressure being put on them—have left the market, which has left a void.', 'At the same time, your major gold companies moved from a methodology of looking for these greenfield projects to looking around their existing assets and exploring the brownfield opportunities. That hasn’t led to any significant resources and reserves being identified.', 'There is slowly a shift and a realization by the industry that it needs to look in new areas, undiscovered areas. I think this will lead to more exploration being done in places like Africa, Russia, and Asia, as mining companies look for the next big deposit.', 'Simon London: I’m kind of wondering, is there a sense in which technology could play a big role in exploration and certainly help to solve this looming—maybe reserve crisis is a bit too strong—but this tension around reserves? What are you seeing out there in the field, Greg?', 'Greg Callaway: I think there’s a couple of things.', 'One is about being able to identify new opportunities and developing reserves and resources. Newmont Goldcorp, for one, is looking at the historical data at Red Lake, applying advanced analytics, crunching through the numbers again, to generate new and improved insights that’ll hopefully get better results. To a similar extent, looking at extending the boundaries, Ryan’s Showing Target from White Gold in Canada is taking new approaches—using drones, for example—and trying to quickly identify where resources and reserves can be developed. That’s the one side of things.', 'The other side of things is going further underground. Historically, reserves and resources have been identified at 300 meters and more below the surface. The next wave is to look at geothermal factors, looking at underground riverbeds and the various dynamics and intrinsic factors within them, to possibly use as lead indicators as to whether gold is going to be found at depth. I think, going forward, we’re going to be seeing more effort being placed in this space.', 'Simon London: More one-kilometer-plus-deep gold mines instead of the sort of 200–300-meter-deep gold mines.', 'Greg Callaway: Absolutely.', 'Simon London: That’s on the exploration side. What about on the production side? Is it the same story, with a lot of advanced analytics being deployed? Or are there other approaches that you see out there that are technologically interesting and promising?', 'Greg Callaway: Well, productivity in the gold industry over the past 14 years has declined significantly—roughly around 30 to 40 percent from its peaks. The industry, while it has seen improvements in recent years, has had to make a step change in the way it thinks about trying to extract material from the ground.', 'We’re seeing—if not from all our clients, then the majority of them—talk about digital and analytics, automation, and how to better operate their mines. This is everything from looking at predictive maintenance to trying to reduce costs to asking how you move into a more autonomous space to removing people from the mine face—particularly where you see the highest risk of fatalities and injuries—and getting efficiencies in automating and running machinery in a more efficient manner.', 'Simon London: The name of the game here is to get your cost base down: your cost per ounce, get it down as far as possible to give you more margin and more flexibility for when the inevitable downswing in the gold price comes.', 'Greg Callaway: Absolutely.', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: I think the gold industry is very similar to other mining sectors, which typically have lagged behind more technologically advanced industries in the B2C area. What we are seeing, though, broadly across the mining sector, is a greater adoption of technology—advanced analytics, digitalization, et cetera—as management teams look for that new wave of productivity.', 'You’re seeing it all through the value chain. You’re seeing it both in terms of processing—so increasing throughput and recovery in plants—through advanced analytics. You’re also seeing it in terms of the mining part of the value chain—improved predictive maintenance or improved use of assets, again, through using advanced analytics. You’re also seeing it in the upstream part of the value chain, with exploration.', 'Greg already touched upon this, with the use of drones, high-resolution cameras, and stochastic models to improve the efficiency and the productivity of the investment dollars being spent in exploration.', 'Greg Callaway: I think one of the reasons the gold industry has adopted new approaches, technology, and advanced analytics is that the pain point for gold has been higher than other commodities, so it’s been incentivized to really turn around its operations.', 'Simon London: How does sustainability play into all of this? I think it’s fair to say that the gold-mining sector is an extractive industry. It doesn’t have the best reputation on environmental issues. Are the companies facing more stakeholder pressure, and what are they doing about it?', 'Greg Callaway: One particular point—as gold-mining companies are highly energy intensive—is moving away from coal-fired electricity to solar. Sibanye-Stillwater in South Africa would be a good case in point. It’s looking to develop a solar plant right next to its Driefontein operation in order to supply power.', 'Oliver Ramsbottom: I would add to what Greg is saying in that, historically, the focus on sustainability was really about license to operate, which was about community relations—making sure that there is enough of the local community working in the mines and the processing plants, local sourcing, et cetera.', 'I think the focus is starting to become stronger on sustainability in terms of environmental protection. CEOs are announcing what the targets are for reducing CO2 emissions—and those are going out in investor presentations, et cetera—and thinking about carbon footprints. Then of course, the gold industry has a bad reputation when it comes to environmental degradation through cyanide leaching. You’re seeing some technology advancement there, like cyanide-free gold leaching. CEOs and management teams, I think, are being held to account a lot more in terms of the environmental footprint, the carbon footprint, that their operations engender.', 'Simon London: What about recycling here? We know that gold doesn’t tarnish—it doesn’t decay. That’s one of the reasons it’s been valued through the ages. Do circular-economy principles play a big role here? Is the flow of previously used gold back into the system significant?', 'Greg Callaway: Recycling’s a very interesting topic—and a topic that gets put forward to us quite frequently. Roughly 190,000 tons of above-ground stocks currently exist within the market. Most of this is toward the jewelry sector because of what is being held by people globally. There are also some that are being held by investors—you know, retail, financial, and in the space of ETFs and central banks.', 'Now, why this is interesting is that the above-ground stocks significantly outweigh what is currently consumed on an annual basis. The gold industry currently consumes between 4,000 and 4,500 tons of gold in a given year. About half of that comes through jewelry, and about two-thirds within that space is particularly linked to Chinese and Indian jewelry consumption. Theoretically, you could have a situation in which no mined supply is needed, and all of your demand can be pulled from what’s being held in above-ground stocks.', 'Simon London: Just make sure I’ve got the math right here. We’ve got about 190,000 tons above ground, which, because gold does not tarnish or decay, is probably close to the sum total of the gold ever mined. Then, on the other hand, demand for gold in a year is only about 4,000 tons. As you say, in principle, if a lot more gold came back onto the market, we wouldn’t need to mine anything for years.', 'Greg Callaway: Now, we’ve run an analysis looking at what’s historically happened, and there are two interesting insights here.', 'One is that recycling peaked in the 2000 to 2011 period, when gold prices rose to roughly around $1,750. About 1,400 tons of gold reentered the market at that point in time. If we look at the jewelry stock over time, only about 1 to 2 percent of annual jewelry stocks ever return. We see that there’s a “stickiness” to recycling. In short, will we ever see a situation where recycling will feed the full requirements of demand in any given year? Highly unlikely. Theoretically, it could play out, but I think we will see a situation where it’ll be a more important role within the gold industry going forward.', 'I think the interesting story when it comes to sourcing gold is Rajesh Exports, which is the largest manufacturer of gold jewelry globally, based in India and Singapore. In order to secure this supply, it has recently bought out Valcambi, the largest refiner in Switzerland. There’ve also been talks of it purchasing mines in Australia—so controlling the full value chain in order to secure from the source as well as the manufacturer and then supply into the various markets that it is active in.', 'Simon London: Interesting. An example of vertical integration in gold, right up through to the jewelry space.', 'Greg Callaway: Absolutely. Coming back to your point, because the above-ground stocks are not as fluid as people would think, you need to source more and more gold on an annual basis, which comes from our mines globally.', 'Simon London: All right, I think that’s all we have time for today.

54,Where next for business in the Middle East?,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/where-next-for-business-in-the-middle-east,"The competitive landscape is shifting across the region as consumer tastes change, new digital champions emerge, and governments deregulate.","['The competitive landscape is shifting across the region as consumer tastes change, new digital champions emerge, and governments deregulate.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey partner Abdellah Iftahy and senior partner Ahmed Youssef about the future of business in the Middle East.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. With geopolitics and conflict dominating the headlines, it is easy to forget that the Middle East is home to hundreds of millions of people who are, for the most part, going to work, going to school, raising families, shopping, and so on. This is not to deny the political complexity, but it does call on us to try and understand the Middle East from economic and business perspectives.', 'For example, can the region create enough jobs to employ its young people? Can governments transition their economies away from dependence on oil and state-owned enterprises? How will the big family-owned groups that have dominated the private sector compete against a new generation of entrepreneurial, tech-savvy competitors?', 'To discuss these issues and more, I met up in Dubai with Ahmed Youssef and Abdellah Iftahy, two McKinsey partners who work with companies across this very big, very complex region. Ahmed and Abdellah, welcome to the podcast.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Happy to be here.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: Thank you. Thank you, Simon.', 'Simon London: Looking in from outside, the region, I think, has been through a bit of a rough patch. We’ve had oil prices considerably below where they were. We’ve also had a fair bit of instability around the region. Ahmed, what’s the mood today?', 'Ahmed Youssef: I think if you ask people that question, you will not get one answer, because it really depends on the leap of faith that you’re ready to take or the kind of skepticism that you have. On the one hand, you have people that actually are very bullish about the region because they see the ambitious transformation. They see some of the bold moves. They see some of the big investments. They see a young population that is thriving and wanting to make a difference. They see a market that actually could be attractive and that is very big.', 'There are others who will basically say, “Well, let’s wait and see,” because they’re skeptical about the geopolitical situation. They’re skeptical about the success of the transformation. They’re skeptical about this kind of volatility of economic activity, which is also driven a lot by oil prices over the last few years.', 'Simon London: So glass half empty, or glass half full.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Exactly.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: Just to add to that, I think there are some structural challenges that we see today, as well as some big opportunities. I think, on the challenges side, there is an unemployment rate that is very high—I think four times the global average—as well as this youth bulge, which you can see as a big challenge or as a big opportunity.', 'Today, when you see the youth and the opportunities they have, I think they are quite limited. One out of four kids has the opportunity to go to school and then gets an opportunity for a job later on, which is a challenge. That is also a big reason for hope going forward because if we find solutions for these youth to be employed, to be educated, these will be the drivers of the economy going forward, from a consumption standpoint, from an innovation standpoint, and from an entrepreneurship standpoint.', 'Simon London: Let’s do a little bit of defining. When we talk about the Middle East, when we talk about the region, what are we talking about? How big is it in terms of population and GDP and those kinds of things?', 'Ahmed Youssef: I mean, “the Middle East” is used with different definitions. I think some use it for GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council], which is six countries: UAE [United Arab Emirates], Saudi, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain. Some others tag MENA—the Middle East and North Africa.', 'In our definition, we take the Middle East and North Africa, and we add Pakistan and Turkey as well because of the strong ties that they have to the region. Then if we take that definition, we are talking about a population of 700 million, which is roughly 10 percent of the global population and $4 trillion of GDP.', 'Ahmed Youssef: For me, the interesting part about the region is the complexity that it has. It has some of the world’s oldest civilizations—be it Egypt or Mesopotamia, established around 3000 BCE—and some of the youngest countries. The majority of the countries were created in the middle part of the 20th century, from Turkey to Lebanon to all the Gulf countries. I mean, the UAE, where we are today, was born in 1971.', 'Simon London: So this contrast between incredibly old civilizations ...', 'Ahmed Youssef: Traditions and youth.', 'Simon London: ... and, actually, quite new institutional structures.', 'Ahmed Youssef: That’s why you see bold, risky moves and traditional, conservative, slow moves. You always see that tension. That also points to the diversity of some of the countries that we actually have.', 'You have some of the richest countries. If you take the GDP per capita of the richest country and the GDP per capita of the poorest country, it’s almost 100 times. If you think about the US, if you look at the richest state to the poorest state, it’s around five to seven times. If you look at Europe, all of Europe, not the European Union, it’s around 15 times. We have a gap of 100 times. So that gives you a big sense.', 'You also look at population. You have the population at 200 million in Pakistan and at 90 million-plus in Egypt. You have Bahrain at 1.5 million.', 'You see, the contrast between the different countries actually is quite stark. That’s what makes this region very complex. People talk about the Middle East as one setup, and it’s not.', 'Simon London: If I’m a CEO looking at the Middle East and thinking about “What’s my Middle East strategy?” is that a concept that even makes sense? Or have I just got to get very granular about “I need different country strategies”?', 'Abdellah Iftahy: There is a typical mistake of thinking about the Middle East as one. I think Ahmed has shared some of the contrast that we see here. It is very important for any CEO or any international organization to think about this region in a much more granular way. Country by country, city by city. If I think about Pakistan, every region is very different. If I think about Saudi, the same thing. The regional differences are quite big. Thinking about this region in a granular way is the number-one step for any strategy that should be set here in the region.', 'In addition, I think local knowledge is extremely important. Because of this diversity, it’s not about just sending the top talent from these international companies to the region. It’s actually about being here, partnering with local partners, family-owned businesses, or other institutions to really go deep into the culture—the behavior, the consumers, the way of doing business—in each of the different regions or countries and make it successful. Then tailor any value proposition or offering that any company would have to those granular pockets of value.', 'Simon London: It sounds to me as if you’re pointing out some kind of “failure modes” when you look at companies that come from outside the region and don’t quite get it right. Would you agree with that, Ahmed? Elaborate a little bit: Where do companies go wrong?', 'Ahmed Youssef: I would agree with that, but let me give a bit of historical view. Over time, a lot of international companies came in. They had only sales kinds of operations, which means that everything was produced outside. Everything was developed outside. Technology companies, their R&D was in the US, in Germany, in South Korea, or other places. Manufacturing, same thing. Cars were done outside. Consumer goods, food, products, same thing.', 'Now the success factors have changed. The consumers are much more demanding. They are requiring something that is much more tailored to them. You have local competition that is starting to produce, be it industrial products, food products, and so on. That requires international companies to be closer and closer to this market. Getting closer to this market, for you to be successful, you have to know the market. You cannot just apply what you’ve done in other markets and come here.', 'They come in with a lot of misconceptions. The first misconception is, “I come in, I’m going to bring all the capabilities. You provide me the land and local connections and local banking.” That’s the first thing I urge international companies to think about, is to be humble about what they know and what they don’t know and to respect the knowledge of the local players here. That would require them choosing and spending and investing time to understand who the local players are that they need to partner with.', 'Simon London: Hubris is a failure mode, by the sound of it.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: Just to add one example to what you just mentioned, Ahmed, I think this holds true for any industry—traditional industries, manufacturing, or even new businesses. Take the example of Uber [Uber Technologies] and Careem—Careem is the local ridesharing company that was very successful that was just acquired by Uber.', 'I was watching an interview of the CEO of Careem, who was talking about the distinctive competitive advantages they had here versus Uber. He mentioned two things. One is that the Uber model, in the US, for example, was mainly reliant on Google Maps to map the locations and the addresses in the country. The second: it was purely, 100 percent credit-card based.', 'When you come here, in the region, and you understand that Google Maps is not that accurate, then you have to build that network from scratch. That’s what Careem did. They had cars going around and picking up GPS coordinates for every single location of some of these remote areas.', 'Plus, there is cash on delivery. If you go to Saudi, specifically, cash on delivery is the mode of payment. It’s not credit cards. Hence, developing all of these processes around that was required. That gave Careem a big advantage; hence, Uber acquired them.', 'That’s a very concrete example of how replicating what worked elsewhere and bringing the technology and the idea and the concept to the local market won’t work, specifically in the Middle East.', 'Simon London: Does that apply to understanding the consumers in the region as well? Is there a distinctiveness in consumer taste and so on? What do we know about that?', 'Abdellah Iftahy: The consumers in this region are very diverse, as are the different countries. I think, in our research that we at McKinsey run here, in the region, we have seen some common trends, as well.', 'Across the region, we see a consumer-behavior and -sentiment conversion to more of that of the average global consumer, in a sense that the consumers are becoming more and more price conscious. Ahmed mentioned there’s a lot of spending power in some of these countries. But even in these countries, now we see consumers looking for prices, looking for deals, and so on and so forth.', 'Consumers are also becoming less and less brand loyal. Today, they are really looking for innovations, new brands, and even cheaper brands. Sometimes, when they switch to these brands, they like the opportunity and stay there. We have seen the number of people that switch to a less-pricey brand double over the last few years.', 'I think those are the trends that we have seen globally. Now we see more and more of these here, in the region. In addition, I think there is a key driver, which is e-commerce. People are looking for more and more convenience. Five years ago, only 5 percent to 10 percent of people were willing to buy their goods online. Today, that number has gone up to 30 percent, 40 percent, which is quite significant. That’s a big driver of e-commerce in the region, where we see all of these deals: Souq [Souq Sellers], Noon, and others that are growing.', 'Also, I think there is another trend that is important to keep in mind. People are becoming more and more health conscious. That is driven by the government. I think this region is known for some of the highest obesity rates, for example. Hence, the introduction of excise tax. That will have an impact on how the consumers are behaving, going forward, but also on how retailers and consumer companies should adjust locally in order to win in this market.', 'Simon London: Something else I read in the research, I think, is consumers are increasingly concerned with supporting local businesses. They’re looking for local brands. They’re looking for local producers, as well, which again—you know, coming from California, which happens to be where I’m based—sounds very familiar. All of this actually sounds very familiar.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: Yes, absolutely. On that specific point, I think people are becoming more ecoconscious, as well. That’s why they are supporting more local brands and so on, especially millennials. Because for them, I think, the ecosystem and sustainability are very high on their values of scale.', 'I think we see convergence to the global average consumer. I would give some corrections about some misconceptions about the consumer here, in the region: that they are wealthier, that they only buy known brands ...', 'Simon London: They’re not price sensitive.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: ... not price sensitive, and so on. I think, now, all the retailers and consumer companies are operating in more-established markets.', 'Ahmed Youssef: I think there is a maturing kind of consumer taste. If I look at the consumers, they were almost somewhat insecure or trapped with the view that whatever comes from the West is great, so they would just take anything, be it in food, in clothing, in cars, in whatever there is. If you look over the last few years, they’re now much more exposed because they’re all technologically savvy. They’re exposed to the world in a much bigger way than they used to be before.', 'They’re becoming more demanding, and they have pride about the tradition. Although they want to change and see change, they’re also becoming more proud of the traditions, more proud of the countries they’re from. Therefore, they’re demanding much more specialization. They’re demanding much more from consumer companies. If I just look at basic F&B concepts, Kuwait is one of the most-interesting markets where you have a number of F&B concepts that were created very locally.', 'Simon London: I don’t know what F&B concepts are.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Food and beverage—basically, the McDonald’s or Burger King equivalent or so on, the concepts that are being created in the region. People are proud that this is something that is coming from the region. It’s something that is tailored to them. It’s not just something that comes in and they inherit.', 'Because of that pride, because of the exposure and really kind of understanding their own taste—and that’s part of a maturing consumer, right—that, for me, is an example of how there is pride now with the concepts that are being created within the region. It’s a bit conceptual, but it’s something that we urge international companies not to ignore and not to undermine: the local innovation that is happening. My advice to them is to research these local innovations and understand these local companies because they might be your best entry.', 'Simon London: Now, something you mentioned a few minutes ago was the scale of the transformation that’s going on in the Middle East. Just double-click on that. What are we talking about? Private sector? Public sector? Both?', 'Ahmed Youssef: The scale of this transformation is, for me, unprecedented in the region. It’s in both the private and the public sector. A lot of these challenges have been festering for a while, so it’s not like there’s a new challenge.', 'We’ve always had a younger population growing very fast. I think, with the scale of the population now, the visibility of the region to the rest of the world, there is no option to kind of do incremental steps. A lot of the revenues are coming from the Gulf countries from oil, and that oil is being invested in the neighboring countries. That’s predictable and stable and growing at a certain speed—or a bit oscillating up and down.', 'But your expenses are growing much faster because, traditionally, most of the investment is driven by the government. I think, in the Gulf and some of the countries, 80-plus percent of the investment that is happening is driven by government or government-related entities.', 'Simon London: Yes. This is state capitalism.', 'Ahmed Youssef: By default, when this growth is actually slow, and your expenses, which is employment, are actually growing much faster—and, in some countries, you’re providing housing, you’re providing some subsidies for local employment, you’re providing other subsidies—it’s creating a challenge that will bankrupt countries, if there’s not a step change. That’s why we’re seeing these bold moves. You have that in the public sector.', 'In the private sector, you also have a big transformation because a lot of the economy is dominated by family groups. “Dominated” is the wrong word, but they’re led by family groups, very similar to what used to happen in the US in the early part of the 20th century, with a lot of the industrialists that were there. They are the ones that were risking their capital and investing in building industries—banking, retail, real estate. A lot of these families today are 50, 60 years old and—this is the difficult part—at the same time, going through a generation transition, which we know doesn’t always work. I think after the third generation, the probability of survival is around 15 percent, so a lot of these businesses will not exist or are at threat of not existing. It’s about beating the odds for them. They have to go through a big transformation, both from a generational point of view but also from a business point of view, to be very competitive in a market that is increasingly tougher to operate in.', 'That push in the private sector is happening to older companies. In the public sector, there is a push to move the burden of employment to create a much more fertile environment for businesses to flourish. It’s happening at the same time.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: I think this holds true across sectors. If you take industrial sectors, retail, consumer, banking, you see, in the private sector, the family-owned businesses taking more and more of an active role in order to drive the economy forward.', 'As Ahmed mentioned, it is not sustainable for the government to be the only one investing. Any healthy economy, going forward, will have to have a healthy balance of government investments and private-sector investments. That’s also what drives a lot of innovation, a lot of entrepreneurship. The government cannot be the employer of choice for everyone. I think the private sector needs to take a much larger share on that front, as well.', 'Simon London: Because, due to demographics, we know what’s going to happen to the population—and to your point, we can fairly well predict what’s going to happen to government revenues—it’s fairly clear where this is leading, unless these transformations are successful.', 'Ahmed Youssef: I’m very optimistic. Look at the venture-capital space. I mean, people would laugh about this three, four years ago. It was nice to have, but it was not really a source of economic development, a source of innovation, and so on. Today, look at it. It’s not just about Uber and Careem or about Amazon and Souq. It’s about many other developments that we will hear about in the next four, five years.', 'The government has created that fertile environment, from countries like Lebanon, where the central bank allocated money for these VC [venture-capital] funds, to the UAE, where you have incubators that have been set up. People were skeptical about them, but we’re starting to see the fruits of all these developments today—and the same thing for the private sector.', 'It’s not about creating their own companies anymore, but they’re actually investing in entrepreneurs, investing in ideas. Seeing this, and seeing how this happened with such speed—an industry that took maybe 30, 40 years to develop outside has developed here in, literally, five years—let’s not underestimate that. This is what, personally, makes me very optimistic about the prospects of the region.', 'Simon London: You just mentioned Souq. For people who aren’t in the region, just remind us of the Souq story. What is it? What happened?', 'Ahmed Youssef: Souq is the equivalent of Amazon in the region, if you will. It’s a marketplace where you can buy pretty much everything. It was established a few years ago. It was quite successful, in terms of growth. It was still at the early stages of development, selling a few products—mostly electronics, beauty and cosmetics, books. It was acquired by Amazon in 2017. It was probably one of the largest deals here, in the region. It shows the importance of the region moving from an energy market to a consumer market, when you see a giant like Amazon prioritizing a deal here in the region.', 'Since that deal, we have seen a lot of e-commerce platforms taking place. Noon is now the other player that is present in the market that was established here to compete with Souq and Amazon and other ventures coming from Rocket Internet that are present in emerging markets, like Namshi or Wadi in Saudi.', 'A couple of weeks ago, we were at the World Economic Forum, where the top 100 Arab start-ups were invited, and it was quite impressive. What struck me is the percentage of companies that are focused on technology. Digital and analytics were a massive share of the start-ups, across industries—in education, fintech, retail, advanced analytics, and digital. That’s just a great example that the youth bulge can bring a lot if we lay out the infrastructure properly for them to innovate and really create some great concepts that can be exported to Africa and to the rest of the world.', 'Simon London: This all sounds very positive. I just want to make sure that we’re not guilty of glossing over some of the challenges. Again, if I’m a CEO looking at the region from the outside in, some of the stability issues and conflict issues are certainly going to be top of my mind in thinking about a strategy. What’s your answer, Ahmed? How do you address that, when that comes up?', 'Ahmed Youssef: Of course. Look, we’re not blind to these challenges. The way I look at it is very different.', 'If I look back, I moved back to the region 16 years ago. If I had a faint heart, there would be maybe three or four times in those last 16 years where I would’ve said, “The world is collapsing. I need to go.” The idea crossed my mind every single time, be it around 2004, then 2008–09, then recently. There were many things: revolutions, oil prices crashing, and so on. If you really look at it in three-year chunks, then it’s not the region you should be investing in.', 'Simon London: Too much volatility?', 'Ahmed Youssef: Too much volatility, and it’s quite scary. But then, if you step back a bit, and if you look at a much wider time frame, the growth that has happened is, again, unprecedented. Just look at the country we’re in.', 'The Port of Jebel Ali: that was actually set up, and people said, “That’s a crazy idea. You know, the region will never be as big,” and so on. And look, it’s one of the largest and most successful ports.', 'If you look at the real-estate market here—I’m just focusing on the UAE; I can give examples in many other places—again, people thought when the economic downturn happened, and there were many conflicts all around, “That’s it. Dubai will never pick up. There will be empty homes; look at the lights in this area. There is no light.” Again, the stock of real estate probably doubled since then. People are still coming and still buying.', 'I think we have to look at it from that lens. We have to look at the long term. At the same time, it’s also important to take a leap of faith that these conflicts, at some point in time, they have to be resolved. They will not benefit anyone. The youth will get the employment. They will get excited with the new technology trends that are happening. They will build their own businesses. There will be a more fertile environment.', 'We have to believe in this. I have to believe in this, as a resident here. Every citizen has to believe in this to bring this region to its full potential. If we are too skeptical, and we fall into the trap of these geopolitical events, nobody will stay here, and no one will invest in this market. But still, people are investing, and we’re still growing, so I’m optimistic.', 'Simon London: But you will concede that you’ve got to take a long-term view. You’ve got to take a through-cycle mentality, and you can’t be afraid of a bit of volatility. Because you’re going to get it.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Exactly. You have to expect the volatility. You just have to be prepared to deal with it. Do you fire people when this happens? Do you close factories? Do you keep factories on? So just be very flexible in the mind-set and also know that—believe that—at some point in time, it will come back.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: Just to add to that, I think instability or volatility has been there, in this region, forever. That didn’t prevent the great years of growth that has been here. Between 2003 and 2015, I think, there was double-digit growth across the board.', 'At the same time, we’re talking about the region. The region has pockets of instability, but it’s not every country. Today, UAE is one of the safest countries in the world. Again, we have to be very granular in our view of instability and, just as Ahmed said, be able to read those and navigate through those times in a very smart way.', 'Simon London: On the topic of volatility, let’s talk a little bit about oil because, clearly, the oil price will move. This is still a very energy-rich region; therefore, oil has a big impact. Has the region managed to diversify away from oil? And will it be able to?', 'Ahmed Youssef: I think this is a question that has always been there. Since before I came to the region 16 years ago, it’s always top of mind of all the governments, but the urgency was not there. It was something important, it was something they knew they had to do, but it was not very urgent. Because oil prices, even with the decline, were high enough and good enough to be able to pay for expenses and build reserves that are quite solid.', 'Today, this urgency is at a scale that is much higher than it used to be. That’s why we see the push for diversification taken much more seriously. Look at Saudi today, the way they are opening up the market and the push they’re actually doing to create industries to serve the local consumer, first, but also to export. We’re going to see the fruits of that in the next five to ten to 15 years. Look at Abu Dhabi again, the industries that they’ve built.', 'Have we reached our objective? Of course not. Will we reach our objective with the ambition that we’ve seen? Most likely, yes.', 'Simon London: So this time, it’s for real.', 'Ahmed Youssef: The urgency is there. You have no option. It’s a one-or-zero outcome in this case, and I think everybody realizes that. But at the same time, I have to take a leap of faith and be optimistic that we will do it. Otherwise, I would not be here in the region.', 'Simon London: So just double-click for me on the government, the public-sector transformation. What sort of things are governments doing in the region?', 'Ahmed Youssef: There are a number of initiatives that are happening, and it’s challenging to list most of them. I will start with the ones that are impacting the private sector quite a lot because I hear the complaints every day.', 'Subsidies, just taking out subsidies, is one for me that is very obvious—be it on electricity prices, on gas prices. These are very difficult decisions because, in many cases, this was the competitive advantage of the region in the private sector.', 'Simon London: Cheap energy.', 'Ahmed Youssef: They had cheap energy through electricity. I had cheap gas. “Great. I will produce. And I’m a superhero.” So that’s taken away because that’s also a cost on the government. It’s difficult, in the short term, for the private sector, but it’s very important for the long-term competitiveness because now, in the private sector, I’m forced to say, “OK, if I don’t have that competitive advantage, how can I adopt new technologies? How can I change my business model? How can I make my employees much more productive?”', 'I think the second part is tax reforms in many places—mainly in the Gulf and less so in other countries, where VAT [value-added tax] has been introduced recently. One benefit of it is to create transparency on transactions, and it’s quite good. It allows us now to have one single source of truth, if I take the simplest benefit of it.', 'Then there are other parts that are quite important, such as about labor reform. I take the example of countries, like UAE, where labor mobility has improved so much over the last 15 years. Before, you would be locked into an employer. You couldn’t leave for a competitor. Your visa had a certain time frame. Today, more and more, for a highly educated and certain type of professional, this is quite mobile, as mobile as it could be in any other market—and probably even more. That, for me, is one part that is quite important, and I foresee more changes on the labor-mobility part because the region is very hungry to attract and keep talented people.', 'Simon London: So just before we run out of time, we’ve been through a number of challenges facing the region. In some ways, it feels like we’re sort of approaching a moment of reckoning. It feels like governments, certainly, can see a moment of reckoning down the road, and they’re responding to that. If I had to push you and say, “Are you optimists or pessimists? Are you strong optimists, medium optimists, or mild optimists or pessimists?,” where would you put yourselves on that spectrum?', 'Abdellah Iftahy: I’m definitely a strong optimist when I look at the demographics, at the intrinsic things that we have here in the region: the new consumers that will take these markets from energy markets to consumer markets; the talent that they offer, with their entrepreneurship and their skill set that is coming up; governments that are taking bold steps towards diversification; a private sector that is willing to take the torch; and finally, natural resources that are still there to fund some of this diversification going forward. I’m definitely optimistic.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Obviously, I’m quite optimistic, and I urge investors to think about this as they think about any risky investments that they actually have when they invest in a business. If you invest in a start-up, there is no formula that will tell you that it is going to be successful or not. You take a leap of faith on the people that are there. You take a leap of faith on the ideas. You basically say, “Yes, there will be some challenges. We don’t know how to fix them, but at some point in time, they will be fixed. Because the idea is right, and the people are right.”', 'I urge investors to think exactly the same way. Either they believe that the reforms that are happening now are going to work—and the idea of this region and what it can bring to the world is something that they believe in—or they just simply don’t take that leap of faith. For me, it’s just really about a leap of faith. As an individual, also, I’ve committed my life here, so I’m definitely an optimist.', 'Simon London: Yes, it kind of goes back to, are you willing to look at the glass as half empty or half full? There’s no right answer to that. You just need to decide.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Absolutely.', 'Simon London: Yeah. Well, thank you for a fascinating conversation. Thank you, Ahmed and Abdellah.', 'Abdellah Iftahy: Thank you.', 'Ahmed Youssef: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And thanks to you, our listeners, for tuning in to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

55,Getting to scale with artificial intelligence,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/getting-to-scale-with-artificial-intelligence,Companies adopting AI across the organization are investing as much in people and processes as in technology.,"['Companies adopting AI across the organization are investing as much in people and processes as in technology.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Tim Fountaine and Tamim Saleh to explore how far most companies are along the road to adoption of artificial intelligence at scale, and how the companies furthest ahead got there.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we are going to be getting practical with artificial intelligence. By now, it’s common knowledge that AI holds immense promise across a wide range of applications—everything from diagnosing disease to personalizing websites. But how far are most companies along the road to adoption at scale? When you look at the organizations furthest ahead, how did they get there and what are they doing differently?', 'To answer these questions, I spoke with a couple of McKinsey partners who are working with clients on exactly these issues. Tim Fountaine is a partner based in Sydney, Australia, and Tamim Saleh is a senior partner based in London. Tamim and Tim, welcome to the podcast. Thank you very much for being here.', 'Tamim Saleh: Thank you.', 'Tim Fountaine: It’s a pleasure to be with you.', 'Simon London: We’re going to be talking not just about the exciting promise of AI, which to be clear is very real, but how in practice—on the ground in real organizations—the promise can be realized. Tim, maybe you take first crack at this. What do we know about how far along most companies are in the journey?', 'Tim Fountaine: Well, I think you’re right. There’s a lot of excitement about the potential of AI, and there are some wonderful examples of AI making real progress and being able to help with diagnosing diseases and healthcare, improving customer experiences, and so forth. But most companies that we’ve talked to in the last few years are not making progress at the pace you might assume from all the newspaper articles. In fact, we did a recent survey of 1,000 companies, and we found that only 8 percent of firms that we surveyed engaged in practices that allowed widespread adoption of AI.', 'The vast majority of companies are still at the stage of running pilots and experimenting. We still believe that AI will add something like $13 trillion to the global economy over the next decade, but putting AI to work at scale remains a work in progress for most companies.', 'Simon London: The companies that are doing this well—the 8 percent you mentioned that are putting the practices in place to get to scale with AI—what are they doing differently?', 'Tim Fountaine: The first thing is they tend to be ahead [in] digitization, generally. There are particular industries where that’s happening more. For example, financial services, telecoms, media, high tech—they’re really leading the way, as you can imagine. They don’t have physical products to the same extent as other industries. They’re really about data and digital information, so, of course, AI is highly applicable in these industries. But no matter which industry companies are in, the ones that are doing the best are paying real attention not only to the technology but also thinking about how it changes their organizations and what kind of culture they need to build in order to be able to take advantage of these new technologies.', 'The ones we see doing well are doing three things right. The first is, organizationally, they’re moving from siloed functional work to cross-functional teams where people from the business, people from analytics, IT, operations all work side by side to achieve particular outcomes. The second one is changing how they make decisions. It’s much less top-down, much less judgment based, but much more empowering frontline teams to make decisions not only using judgment but also using algorithms to help improve the way they make decisions.', 'Finally, there’s something about mind-set, something about moving from being risk averse and only acting when you have the perfect answer to being much more agile, willing to experiment, being adaptable, being willing to fail fast, but learn fast and get things out quickly.', 'Simon London: Yes. I mean, on the one hand, that makes a lot of sense. On the other, what you’re describing there, Tim, sounds like wholesale change. It’s a lot of change on a lot of different organizational dimensions. Tamim, let me bring you in here. In practical terms, in your work with clients, where do you even begin?', 'Tamim Saleh: One of our clients, for example—a leading European steel manufacturer—wanted to industrialize AI. It wasn’t just about doing a number of pilots or MVPs [minimum viable products] or tests. The CEO, who I remember in the very first discussion we had with him, looked at the problem as a people problem. He didn’t want a technology story or “here are the use cases.” He actually asked a question: “How will my people deliver AI? What kinds of skills do they need to have? How do I fit this into our culture?”', 'Some of the things that they looked at, for example, were to understand what proportion of their organization needs to be [technologically] literate. They quickly came to the conclusion that the concept of a translator—people in the business, whether they are in operations or in sales or in quality management, who understand how analytics are applied—was needed. Then they used their knowledge to work with the data scientists and the data engineers to produce the initiatives and the use cases and industrialize and deploy them and make sure that they continuously developed. They budgeted, for example, for the adoption, the training, and the development of people as much [as], if not more than, for the technology itself.', 'They spent a lot of time on training. They built an academy for analytics that trained 400 of their 9,000 workers in the first year. That led them, within a period of 18 months, to produce 40 initiatives, with a 15 percent EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] improvement. If anything, they are continuing to accelerate the level of application of analytics. In fact, the objective is that the penetration of analytics will be in everything that they are doing. It becomes business as usual. The key lesson learned out of all of this is that when a company wants to apply analytics, they should look at the problem not just from the technology end or the data quality but the people side and the mind-set.', 'Tim Fountaine: One of the things we often see companies getting wrong is they’re building analytical models—AI models—but really failing to think through how does that change the business. I think one of the things the companies that are getting it right have realized is that AI is just another tool for solving business problems or achieving business outcomes. As such, AI is a way of changing a workflow, changing the way that people work together. One of the things we’ve found in our survey is the companies that were doing best were spending as much of their money or budget on change and adoption—workflow redesign, communication, training—as they were on the technology itself.', 'Simon London: Let me just clarify there. Companies are spending as much on training and adoption as they are on the actual technology. Because I think a lot of people might find that surprising.', 'Tamim Saleh: Yes. A lot of people might find that surprising because the assumption is that in order to deploy analytics, you need to invest heavily in data management and quality and buying the technology. But the vast majority of problems, the blockers, happen outside the agile analytics labs. It happens, for example, because the finance budgeting process does not cater to the fast development of use cases. Or it happens, for example, because the HR function is not familiar with how to recruit data scientists. What does an experienced data scientist really look like? Or it happens, for example, because the IT function is not designed in a way that they can rapidly access data in many, many data sources, so that you can implement use cases rapidly.', 'Increasingly, organizations now realize that the battle is not just to buy the technology or create small, agile teams that produce pilots but to actually think of agile for the organization in totality and then begin to address and make decisions in areas like training and budgeting. To cut the story short, the battle cuts across the entire organization and the entire management team—whether it’s the CFO, HR director, CIO, CMO, they all have a role to play in lubricating the process. The operating model works end to end to deploying analytics at scale. That’s why people are now beginning to put more attention and budgets outside of the technology area.', 'Tim Fountaine: Just to take an example that is quite a common one from mining or heavy industries: predictive maintenance—moving from maintaining equipment to stop it from breaking, maintaining it at regular intervals, to a system where you use AI to predict when machines are going to break, then being able to intervene just at the right time to stop things from breaking or be able to accommodate that in the operations. The analytics of that has been done dozens and dozens of times around the world. It’s certainly solvable.', 'The hard thing—and often it’s surprising to people—is that to be able to take advantage of that, AI technology means totally changing the way companies maintain equipment. It means rostering your maintenance staff differently; it means ordering spare parts with a different frequency; it means scheduling how your mind works differently to accommodate predictive maintenance of equipment. It’s a huge change, and it’s not just about the technology or the AI application itself.', 'Simon London: Is there an element here that’s about overcoming fear? I can imagine that when a lot of people hear that their company is going to deploy AI at scale, quite frankly they worry about whether their jobs are still going to be around.', 'Tamim Saleh: Yes, indeed. One of the big issues is that people assume that an AI-enabled transformation will replace everything that they are doing. The reality is, AI itself is not superuseful; it’s actually man–machine, human–machine—for example, tasks like demand forecasting in supply chain or tasks like targeted marketing. [AI] is most powerful when you have the experience [of] demand forecasters or marketers knowing how to use AI to make much better decisions.', 'For the vast majority of activities or tasks that people are doing, you still need human judgment, but working together with AI you get much better outcomes. Awareness is important, and there are, increasingly, many companies that are not just training the core 10 percent or so who are delivering AI but are also making sure that the entire organization, through online training and other forms of training, understand how AI will work in the environment, how to live with it and benefit from it.', 'Tim Fountaine: One of the other things that companies doing this well have managed to create is a portfolio of AI initiatives. One part of that is being able to balance building to the long term and really changing how business works using AI, at the same time being able to deliver things quickly to maintain momentum, build some excitement, and show the potential. For example, one retailer that’s adopting AI as part of its category-management process, they eventually want to use AI to completely change how they think about space and what kind of assortment they have in the store. But that’s going to be a multiyear process. While they’re building toward that, they’re using the same data and a lot of the same ideas to provide a little tool to store managers so that they can order a few extra items that AI predicts will sell well within their stores, to generate some initial sales, generate some initial excitement, show the potential, and buy the time needed to do the more ambitious reorganization of their assortment in the stores.', 'Tamim Saleh: The point about the portfolio of AI initiatives is that sometimes companies or people mistake it and think about it as a list of initiatives, but it is not a list.', 'Simon London: Basically, it cannot be just a grab bag of use cases that have been harvested from across the company. There has to be thought given to the staging and the rollout and the sequencing of these over time.', 'Tamim Saleh: Correct, yeah.', 'Tim Fountaine: One of the things, I think, that companies who are doing well have realized is, yes, you can find interesting places where you can apply AI models across your company, but it doesn’t fundamentally change the way you do things.', 'Simon London: Double click for a moment on this concept of the AI academy. What are the elements that you’ve seen in practice that contribute to a successful academy or an academy-like program?', 'Tim Fountaine: One of the things is starting at the top. The organizations we see that are doing this best start with the board and the executive team, including the CEO, and making sure that the top managers, the top decision makers, in the organization really understand it. The other thing is not just focusing on technical talent for training but really emphasizing the training of translators: people who have, potentially, been in business for a long time and don’t know much about machine learning, but they do understand how the business works.', 'Take the steel-company example. This might be people who are overseeing shifts of engineers who are working on particular parts of the machinery—teaching them about AI so that they can then work with data scientists and engineers to design solutions that are right for their business. [It’s important to] understand the data properly and make sure people think through some of the implementation challenges at the other end.', 'Tamim Saleh: The other thing that is important is that this is not classroom training, where a data scientist learns data science or a translator learns translation. It’s training on the job.', 'Simon London: What’s your advice for senior executives at a company that’s on this journey? What can you do? What are the behaviors that you can model so that you become part of the solution here and not part of the problem?', 'Tim Fountaine: Well, one CEO who’s been very successful in driving AI in their company began by setting the right example. I think this is important. The first thing he did was to show up to the analytics training—just like everyone else, get stuck into some coding and ask questions about how machine learning works and so on. For a lot of leaders, it’s quite uncomfortable leading in a world where you don’t really know all the answers yourself and you’re going to rely on data scientists and engineers and other types of experts to advise you. One of the best things you can do is just be humble and ask lots of questions and be open to taking advice from others.', 'Then, of course, one thing the CEO did well was one of their first initiatives didn’t actually work. It wasn’t because of anything the team could have done differently; it was just that it was a hard problem. That was a real moment of truth for them. In this case, the CEO was great and said, “I think you’ve done a wonderful job. I really celebrate that you took the risk to do this. What have we learned, and what can we take forward to the next thing?” Of course, if he had said, “Gosh, what a disaster, this is terrible,” that would have shut down the whole thing for them.', 'The other thing that this particular person did was also make the businesses accountable, not the AI specialists or the chief analytics officer. He always made sure to talk to the business owners, the product owners, the heads of the businesses where these ideas were going to be implemented, to ask them how it was doing, to report back on what was happening. He rigorously tracked what was happening and where things weren’t moving as fast or as quickly; he asked questions and helped people solve the problems.', 'Simon London: What about the organizational-design piece—this question of whether to have analytics resources sort of clustered at the center or, on the other hand, pushed out into the business units and functions?', 'Tim Fountaine: Well, it’s not an either/or decision; you actually need both. You need some kind of central hub, as well as capability out in the businesses and what you might call spokes.', 'We know that from our survey. Companies that are doing well with AI are three times as likely as their peers to have some kind of central capability.', 'The responsibilities that are almost always best managed centrally are things like data governance, setting systems and standards for AI, recruiting and training, and even defining what it is to be a data scientist at your company. Of course, there are other things that are much better done out in the businesses, in the spokes. Those are things like workflow redesign, choosing where to focus organizational change—that needs to be done as part of implementing an AI solution.', 'Tamim Saleh: It’s interesting, Tim. Three or four years ago, some companies went for a completely distributed model, with no hub. They ended up creating new types of complexity: teams in different parts, trying to sort the problem—the same problem—with different methods, different data architecture, or IT architecture. They never managed to scale.', 'The reverse is also true. Some companies centralized analytics completely. That led to other sorts of problems that were quite far from the business. The business didn’t buy in. Over time, their hub-and-spoke model evolved because of the pain that some of the companies endured. The two extremes, in most cases, don’t work.', 'Simon London: At the risk of a wild generalization, it sounds like companies that are struggling to get to scale with AI probably haven’t invested enough at the center. Do you think that’s fair to say?', 'Tim Fountaine: I think that’s true, although the more mature companies are, I think, the more they can push things out into the spokes. But it does require having some standardization and a culture where people will stick to that.', 'Tamim Saleh: Yeah, it’s not easy for many organizations, because the issue here is that you need to get the balance between common language, common protocols, common methodologies, because analytics has a network effect. You need to be able to connect use cases together over time, and that requires discipline. At the same time, you need to give the businesses the freedom and access to skills inside their businesses in a distributed way. It’s not natural for most organizations, which are functionally led, to have that model.', 'Simon London: Maybe just take that down to the level of an individual initiative: a project team charged with implementing a use case. What roles do you need? What’s the mix of people from the hub versus the spoke, and what are some of the common mistakes?', 'Tamim Saleh: The teams need to be interdisciplinary teams end to end, from the business concept to the development of the design, as in the user-experience design and how you use the use case to the mathematics itself and the data science. Then the technology, in terms of the data ingestion, data engineering, and then the technology underneath that in terms of that platform.', 'Most importantly, the interdisciplinary teams should be outside of these labs, in terms of how you industrialize that use case—the training of the users, any interfaces that need to happen with processes, any changes that need to happen in processes outside. When you get teams working in this form, they are much more productive. You have a much higher probability of getting it right the first time or closer to that, and a much higher probability of the use case being relevant and applied. There are some key roles—in particular, like the product owner. That would be the manager in charge who is responsible for the new AI tool’s success. It should be important to his or her business. The translators are the people who are literate [in] that business domain and take an active part in developing the use case with the data scientists and data engineers.', 'Then you’ve got the experts, like the data architects and scientists and designers and visualization people. Outside that group, one needs to think about industrialization for the professionals who do that training and the tracking, which would cover people from change management, org design, to finance professionals. That’s quite often the part that is missed. Even today, as we speak, I would say the majority of organizations pay little attention to what is outside the immediate agile team of experts and translators when it comes to productionizing. This is something that we’re speaking about a lot with our clients, trying to make sure that there’s a lot of awareness and prioritization of that part as well.', 'Simon London: So again, it’s the adoption piece, right? You can come up with a solution that potentially can add a whole lot of value to the business, but you have to get it adopted.', 'Tamim Saleh: Exactly that.', 'Tim Fountaine: One other thing that’s important is actually tracking value. We see a lot of companies implementing models but never following up to see how well the change associated with that model occurs and whether or not it’s working and being able to improve the models over time. That value capture, measuring every few weeks, isn’t working. Then being able to course correct accordingly is crucial.', 'Simon London: Just say a little bit more about the product-owner role. Clearly, that’s pivotal. Is that a person who should be a deep expert coming from the center? Or is that someone who should be pulled from and reside in the business?', 'Tim Fountaine: It’s important they come from the business. They’re going to be the person who goes back to the business and tries to convince everyone to adopt this new tool or ways of doing things, so they have to really understand how things work in the business. They have to have the trust of their peers to be able to convince them to do it, and they need to be around for the long term to be able to make sure this particular solution gets implemented.', 'Tamim Saleh: A good product owner should be somebody who wholeheartedly and absolutely understands the value of analytics in his or her business. More often than not, analytics will change the way they work. For example, if you are a product owner in retail, and you are getting much more granular insight on what you could put on the shelves for individual stores, that will have an impact on the way you do logistics, replenishment, and promotions.', 'Therefore, you need to change the way your people work. That’s very different than a product owner that sees analytics as a use case for an individual task or part of a list. A good product owner needs to see the big picture and think of analytics as a journey.', 'Simon London: I think we are, sadly, out of time for today. But Tim and Tamim, thank you very much for doing this.', 'Tamim Saleh: It’s a pleasure; thank you very much.', 'Tim Fountaine: It’s a pleasure, Simon.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you, our listeners, for tuning in to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

What opportunities and risks lie ahead as “the Asian century” unfolds?,"['Asia will account for more than half the global economy by 2040. What opportunities and risks lie ahead as “the Asian century” unfolds?', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Wonsik Choi, Oliver Tonby, and Jonathan Woetzel about the future of Asia.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. If the 19th century was dominated by Europe, and the 20th by North America, there is a strong argument that the current century will belong to Asia.', 'On current trends, Asia will account for more than half of global GDP by around 2040. While China will remain an engine on growth, on current trends, the rest of Asia will contribute just as much. As we’ll hear, the region, as a whole, is also becoming more integrated—whether you look at the flow of goods, finance, people, and even culture.', 'To discuss the future of Asia, I sat down in Seoul with Oliver Tonby, who is McKinsey’s Asia chairman, Wonsik Choi, who leads the firm’s Korea practice, and we’re also joined on the line by Jonathan Woetzel. Jonathan is the leader of the McKinsey Global Institute, and he’s based in Shanghai.', 'Simon London: Oliver, Wonsik, Jonathan, thank you so much for joining, and welcome to the podcast.', 'Oliver Tonby: Thank you for inviting us.', 'Wonsik Choi: Thank you. Thank you for having us.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: A pleasure to be here.', 'Simon London: A phrase that I think we’re hearing increasingly in the media is this concept of the Asian century. This idea that we are moving into a period where Asia is going to be maybe the dominant region economically, but maybe in other ways too. Oliver, let’s start with you. What do you think?', 'Oliver Tonby: I do think there is something to that. Let’s talk about GDP. Asia is going to be home to 50 percent of the world GDP by 2040. If you look at where the growth in consumption is coming from, the growth in the consuming class, it’s in Asia.', 'Look at technology. In April, the world had an order of magnitude 300 unicorns, 119 of which are Asian. If you look at VC [venture capital] funding, 40 percent of VC funding globally is Asian. If you look at some of the world’s best-performing companies, they happen to be Asian. You can look at it many different ways, but there is absolutely something to this Asian century. As we say, the question is no longer “Is Asia going to rise?” The question is, “How is Asia going to lead?”', 'Simon London: Would you agree with that, Wonsik?', 'Wonsik Choi: Absolutely. I think the Asia century is not only inevitable, but it’s already here.', 'In the past 50 years, seven countries in the world have grown at 3.5 percent or more in terms of GDP per capita. All of those countries are Asian countries. In the past 20 years, 11 countries have grown at or above 5 percent GDP per capita. More than half of them are Asian countries, so it’s already here.', 'As Oliver said, half of the world in terms of GDP is going to be Asian. Half of the global middle class will be Asian. Forty percent of global consumption will be Asian. Simply put, in 20 years, half of the world will be Asia.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Just to build on that, I think that the Asian century is an indisputable reality. The only reason people might dispute it is that they’ve been essentially living in the past, and it has arrived on us relatively quickly in terms of how fast everything flipped.', 'What does the implication of this being an Asian century—in terms of the center of commerce, of consumption, of capital, and technology—leave for the rest of the world? Notably, of course, for Europe and North America, but also for emerging markets.', 'That is a great question, because it leads us smack into this relationship between Asia and the world, if we look at issues that are globally relevant such as the environment, security issues, or health issues. There Asia and the world must collaborate more closely than they have in the past if we are going to address these issues. Asia will be at the center, but it will take a global effort.', 'If we go into obviously economic issues, where there have been more conflicts recently, there may well be a need to rethink some of those arrangements, which were essentially created in earlier eras. Whether they’re about how to manage currencies, obviously intellectual property is a big flash point.', 'Simon London: I think the interesting thing in the light of that answer is the news from out of Asia at the moment is anything but positive. We’ve effectively got a trade war going on between the US and China. There are also other tensions between Korea and Japan. There are issues in Hong Kong. How would you answer that, Wonsik?', 'Wonsik Choi: My personal view is that the biggest uncertainties and risks in the way of economic growth, ironically, are not economic.', 'I think these are geopolitical and political uncertainties and risks. I think the good news from my point of view is that it’s not new to Asia. We’ve dealt with these issues before. What I would like to urge the business leaders and the policy makers and the broader constituents out there is not to lose the win–win perspective.', 'Asia is becoming much more intertwined in terms of economic flows and activities. It is impossible for China, for example, to grow on its own; that’s also the case for Korea and Japan. Everything value chain wise is becoming much more intertwined. It’s a very complex thing to unravel.', 'Oliver Tonby: I’m going to just add to that. Listen, it’s very clear. These are big worries, they are top of mind for CEOs globally. Absolutely, people are worried. We are worried. We see these developments. Having said that, the long term is quite clear.', 'Some of these trends are long term, and they’re to the point of being unstoppable. Because it’s driven by the rise of demographics and rising income, because it’s driven by technology innovation, and, by the way, technology that is for the most part already present in the region, there’s kind of something here that is inevitable.', 'Wonsik Choi: Twenty years ago, Asia had 2.2 billion people in the working age population. In 20 years, that number will increase to 3.4 billion people. That’s a whopping one-billion-person addition to the labor force.', 'Oliver Tonby: We also see—I think it’s not to be underestimated—social progress. What do I mean? Education levels are going up. Today, almost 50 percent of the world’s international students are Asian. Basic education is going up. We see rights for women—protection by law and what have you, all of the social progress in all of the countries. Now, it is not where it needs to be, but it is increasing. That’s one of the fundamental drivers here.', 'Simon London: That’s a fundamental driver of productivity, isn’t it? Because a healthy person, an educated person, an included person is much more likely to be an economically productive person.', 'Oliver Tonby: Exactly.', 'Simon London: I think an interesting point is, sitting from where I sit in the US, the news flow is overwhelmingly dominated by China. To what extent is the future of Asia story a China story?', 'Oliver Tonby: China is, of course, an incredibly important part of the story, but it is not only China. We actually talk about four different Asias. We talk about China, as you mentioned for obvious reasons, given its size, given its stage of development, and other technology, technological developments that are happening in China.', 'We also talk about advanced Asia. The Japans, Australias, the New Zealands, Singapores, Koreas, which are highly advanced countries that are already well developed. We talk about emerging Asia; call it ASEAN-plus. Then we talk about India and frontier Asia. The latter two have large populations. They are growing. That’s where we see the growth, especially in the middle-class populations. We see rapid urbanizations. The interplay between these four Asias is what makes this really interesting.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Speaking from China, where I’ve been living for the past 30-odd years, everything looks a bit Chinese. We believe in, as Oliver said, the four Asias, that this is an increasingly interconnected region. I can’t remember which long-gone English statesman made the comment that Asia is a geographic expression, not an economic or cultural identity. That was true 200 years ago, and Asia is physically still just a collection of islands.', 'What we’re starting to see now is Asia as an actual Asia where there are increasing linkages between the regions of Asia, both economically, and, for that matter socially, environmentally, and physically. That is the context for it all. Whether we’re talking about manufacturing value chains that span multiple countries or innovation where finance unites the region across a whole bunch of multilocal solutions. Or tourism, where there are flows to and from pretty much every Asian country, albeit with a substantial China focus or a China component to it, but with increasingly growing non-Chinese components. The flows which go regionally, not to and from China. I would say it’s an important side but trying to separate Asia into a China and a non-China would sort of miss the point of Asia: Asia as a region and Asia as an interconnected network.', 'Simon London: One of the big takeaways for me, reading the latest McKinsey research is this figure that 60 percent of Asian trade now is intraregional trade. It’s a little bit lower than the European Union or little bit lower than Europe, but actually higher than North America, higher than Latin America, higher than any other region.', 'Oliver Tonby: There’s no question that Asia is becoming more Asian, and that’s driven by several things. The different Asias that we talked about, goods flowing from the advanced Asia into other parts, that’s one measure of the interconnectedness, but we also see other things. We see FDI [foreign direct investment]. Fifty percent of FDI is intraregional, meaning investments that are now going into the Indonesias and Malaysias and India are coming.', 'Simon London: From within Asia.', 'Oliver Tonby: Fifty percent of that is from within Asia. That is true whether it’s for M&A purposes or if it’s for greenfield investment purposes. We also see it at a more company-by-company level; we see companies investing in new countries, whether it’s in the Philippines or it’s in Vietnam. This is being accelerated by the ongoing trade tensions for sure, but there’s also a long-term development here. Long story short, absolutely more and more interconnectedness.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Yes, there are some interesting patterns. Of course, on the manufacturing and supply chain we have seen this big question of what will happen to Chinese manufacturing, where does that go? Over the past ten years, we’ve finally started to see Chinese low-end value-added manufacturing migrate. Migrate internally, but also migrate to the region and throughout the region, notably to places that have a port, that have reliable local infrastructure, which are able to provide a low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing option. That’s a finite number of places.', 'Some of the countries and regions that have picked up a share, have been of course Vietnam. We look at Hai Phong, for example, as an up-and-coming medium-sized city. That has really picked up a lot of share recently.', 'There are others. If one goes to the Dhaka airport in Bangladesh, you see the same kinds of advertisements that we saw in China 25 years ago for Guangxi, for zipper manufacturers for the textile industry. I think that investments and manufacturing technologies are regional, with some things like machines from Japan or Korea or China, are now operated by people in Bangladesh or Cambodia or Vietnam.', 'That’s manufacturing. On the technology side, I think what we start to observe—and I’ll link this a bit to finance—is that it is very multilocal in the sense that we have multiple ride-sharing technologies and networks and multiple internet search engines, reflecting the different regional characteristics.', 'What is common across many of these countries is the finance sources, in the sense that there is a regional venture capital, there’s a regional private equity, there’s a regional multilateral development bank network.', 'The flows in Japan and Korea, as the aging societies, are increasingly taking a leading role in the funding of technology, and by extension, by infrastructure, digital infrastructure, physical infrastructure, and the surpluses that are being generated by the aging societies are now increasingly being deployed across emerging Asia.', 'Then finally culture and tourism. I think it is fair to say that China is really driving the bus there. As we look at the flows we see this massive outgrowth in outbound tourism from China, notably to Bangkok, Thailand, where I understand Chinese tourists account for upwards of 9 or 10 percent of all Thai retail consumption, which is pretty amazing.', 'Simon London: As an executive from outside the region, does it even make sense to think about an Asia strategy? How do you advise executives from outside the region to even conceptualize an Asia strategy, in the light of such a big and diverse region?', 'Oliver Tonby: That is a tough question. On the one hand, those of us who are based here and live here, we know that there’s not one Asia, so you’re absolutely right. At some stage it does not make sense to think about one Asia.', 'Having said that, you do need to think about, what is my supply chain, for example, across Asia? That is changing rapidly. For multiple reasons that we’ve talked about it’s changing, because the respective economies are becoming more advanced. Labor arbitrage is no longer a reason to start building a plant here or there.', 'Less than 20 percent of today’s trade is actually based on that low cost at labor arbitrage. There is an Asian question around how do I think about my supply chain? It has become even more important now when you see some of the trade disputes, trade tensions, not only between the US and China and Brexit, but also Japan and Korea. This whole topic is now much more alive, and there is an Asian question in and around that.', 'Simon London: How do I think about my Asia footprint in terms of manufacturing supply operating model? This is a big deal.', 'Oliver Tonby: Absolutely. I think there is a question around Asia in terms of if I’m an MNC [multinational corporation], where do I base my headquarters? I think we need to move away from the single Asian headquarters; it doesn’t work. You need multiple.', 'Where do I place my sources of innovation? R&D, but also innovation more broadly, innovation of business models, innovation in products that we’re selling. I think there are Asian angles, but going back to your starting point, there is no one Asia. This is complicated question.', 'Wonsik Choi: Key to me is whether that understanding is granular enough. For example, beyond the Shenzhens, the Shanghais what are the next up-and-coming cities that will propel economic growth?', 'What are you doing about those, if you’re a consumer retail company, or even a global company that wants to establish manufacturing bases? Did you know that Hai Phong in Vietnam and Bekasi in Indonesia, for example, are two of many cities in Asia that are rapidly becoming production centers for electronic products?', 'If you’re in the sector, maybe you do. If you’re not, maybe that’s a level of granularity that is worth educating yourself and the rest of the management team as well as the organization about, so that you know Asia properly and how rapidly it is evolving, versus the picture that you may have as of today.', 'Simon London: Just say a little bit more about the corporate scene across Asia. As you mentioned, it has some unique characteristics.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I think that the Asian corporate ecosystem is its own thing. It’s clearly got its own drivers and its own history. One of which has been, in most environments, a relatively outsized role for multinational corporations. Look at China, for example. Multinationals have almost twice the share of the market in China as they do in the United States. In terms of who’s who on the playing field, there’s a lot more multinational presence in Asia than in other parts of the world. That’s one difference.', 'The second characteristic of the Asian context is that it is high-growth context, and of course there’s been higher growth macroeconomically, but it’s also microeconomically higher growth. We see companies growing faster in their top lines and to, some extent, in their bottom lines, though not always across the region.', 'That shapes the characteristic of competition. It’s a much more volatile world. To Asia’s benefit, it’s a more dynamic one, especially as we look at small- or medium-sized enterprises becoming medium- to large-sized enterprises. That’s really what shapes industries, and we’ve seen more of that and we’ve seen more of that competitive middle market in Asia than we have in more mature environments in the last couple of decades. I think that’s a second factor.', 'Oliver Tonby: We look at what is called a power curve, which is, what are the companies that are delivering economic profit? In the top 10 percent globally, more than half of those happen to be Asian. These are the top 10 percent performing companies globally. More than half of them happen to be Asian.', 'Simon London: That’s performing in terms of economic value added, right?', 'Oliver Tonby: Economic value added over the cost of capital, yes, to get specific.', 'Simon London: Yeah, yeah.', 'Oliver Tonby: Now that’s interesting. Our companies here are making significant amounts of economic profit. By the way, at the other end of the spectrum, there’s also quite a number that are destroying value. Let’s be clear. What’s interesting to see, it’s a much more dynamic population. The probability of staying in that top 10 percent is actually lower in Asia. There is more change in who are the winners. That comes for a variety of reasons. It comes from just the overall growth in the economies, which basically gives rise to new companies growing more quickly. You see the rate of innovation, of technology, basically allows new business models, new products.', 'Wonsik Choi: I think the challenge for many Asian companies is not about the ambition to get big, not in size, but also in profits, but the way to get there.', 'One of the things that many Asian companies need to overcome in that disruptive journey is changes in their approach to governing their businesses. Many of the Asian companies that have been successful have been growing through a lot of what I call top-down entrepreneurship.', 'It will still be relevant and important going forward, but many of the companies would have to shift their orientation in terms of their approach to innovation, much more bottom-up, voluntary, fast to fail. A lot of what companies are trying to adopt in terms of digital ways of working, agile ways of working, these will be foundational to their transformation going forward.', 'Oliver Tonby: Let’s come back to and spend a little bit more time on this innovation happening in Asia, because I think this is a very important point. We have heard a lot about the Chinese ecosystem players and their rise, and I think that’s a fantastic growth story, and they will continue to be very important. But I think it’s not only that. I think it’s important that we are aware of, if you look at the VC funding happening today in fields such as virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, robotics, drones, AI [artificial intelligence], there is more VC funding for those happening in Asia than there is in the rest of the world.', 'This is a very large part: the VC funding is happening. If you look at some of the companies that are coming and growing out of this in diverse sectors, you look at it’s now either the world’s largest or second-largest hotel operators, Oyo, which is an Indian company.', 'You can we can talk about Grab, Gojek, Tokopedia that come out of ASEAN. We can talk about Ola Cabs. There’s just a proliferation of companies that are driven by technology and that are coming out of Asia.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: If I could go on from there for just a second. One of the characteristics of Asian innovation I think is that it is multilocal in that while there is a sharing of the basic ideas and the standards, if you will, as well as the finance, but the actual marketplace that Asians are developing much of their technology for is an Asian marketplace.', 'It’s quite natural to see as areas and regions within Asia have a bigger local marketplace and they combine that with a source of human capital, and yes, a willing and large customer such as the government or a large employer, that they can and do develop their own local innovative capacities.', 'That’s what we mean by multilocal—it’s a cluster development. That’s what we are going to see across Asia, is a set of innovative clusters sharing global technology standards. We don’t think that, for example, there will be magically another 7G or 10G that sort of miraculously appears. China, Asia understands the value of having a common standard. But a local development capacity to develop and to innovate against that standard, to meet that standard’s requirements. That’s what we are going to see.', 'Simon London: We talked a little bit earlier about some of the geopolitical tensions, the trade tensions, that have been going on at the moment that are in the news. If we think about the other things that could go wrong with the Asian century that either could knock it off track, or the big challenges that you need to be able to overcome, what are the sort of things that spring to mind?', 'Oliver Tonby: There are several. Let me just mention a few. Number one, uneven or unequal distribution. We now see countries, sectors, parts of the population, the haves and the have-nots. This is important. If we have increasing differences in inequality, that could derail. How countries deal with rising inequality is absolutely critical. We do see, by the way, rising Gini coefficients in many countries. This is one thing to point out. The second one is sustainability, in particular, environmental sustainability. We have some of the most polluted cities to the point where you cannot be outdoors in several of these cities.', 'This is a huge problem: how cities and countries go about dealing with environmental issues, climate change, unhealthy cities, plastics, and water. [There are] eight million tons of plastic put into rivers every single year, and most of them are in Asia. Environmental sustainability is a huge topic. Climate change is included there.', 'The third one I would point out is, if some of these tensions that we currently do see—trade tensions, geopolitical tensions—evolve into something more, that would obviously be a huge problem.', 'Simon London: Wonsik, anything to add?', 'Wonsik Choi: I think economic inequality, among many other challenges that I also recognize, is the most concerning potentially for me. That is being accelerated, aggravated, by the digital disruptive technological innovations that are happening, which for the most part are creating big benefits for humankind and also the global economy.', 'By the way, that issue with respect to technology-driven inequality is not a new issue nor is it a unique issue for Asia. It’s a global issue to address together. At least part of the solution will involve redeployment of the labor force that’s actually out there. It’s not a trivial task.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I think that the Asian context in many ways is going to be the testing ground for defining a new set of arrangements, if for no other reason than Asia is ground zero when it comes to disruption. There’s no country or region on the planet that’s had more disruption in the past 30 or 40 years than Asia.', 'China has been at the center of a lot of that, but not exclusively, and by no means going forward. I mean that we’re going to see as exclusively that all of Asia is going to be experiencing vast amounts of change.', 'In the change lies the potential for developing a solution. It is often the case that we develop solutions because we must; not because we want to, but because they’re necessary.', 'How do cities in Asia help absorb the next 300 million, 400 million urban arrivals? What will be the social impacts of a global distribution of AI across the economies? I mean these are issues that will affect Asian countries very quickly, and already are. They will be at the forefront of developing the new sets of solutions and arrangements for them.', 'Simon London: Sad to say, I think we’re out of time today, but thank you for a fascinating discussion, Oliver, Jonathan, and Wonsik.', 'Oliver Tonby: Thank you, Simon. Really appreciate it.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: It’s been my pleasure, Simon. Thank you for making the time.', 'Wonsik Choi: Likewise, thank you.

They also tend to work in different sectors. The implications are everyone’s business.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Kweilin Ellingrud and Lareina Yee about the role of women in the global workforce and the experiences of women in the workplace.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be taking stock of the role of women in the global workforce and also the experiences of women in the workplace. In other words, we’ll be starting with a macrolevel view on this hugely important topic before zooming in on the micro. If you’ve started to lose track of everything that’s published at this complex intersection of gender and work, this podcast is for you.', 'To discuss the facts, I sat down in Vancouver with Lareina Yee and Kweilin Ellingrud. Lareina is a leader in McKinsey’s High Tech Practice and is also the Firm’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. She helps to lead the Women in the Workplace research project, in partnership with LeanIn.Org and the Wall Street Journal. Now in its fifth year, Women in the Workplace 2019 published on October 15, so please do keep an eye open for it.', 'Kweilin is a leader in McKinsey’s Operations Practice. She sits on the advisory council of the McKinsey Global Institute and helps to lead the Institute’s Power of Parity research program.', 'Lareina and Kweilin, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for being here.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: Thank you.', 'Lareina Yee: Thank you for hosting us in Vancouver.', 'Simon London: You are more than welcome. We’re going to cover a lot of ground today. What I’d like to do is start with the macro, thinking about women in the workforce, the global workforce. Later on, we’ll go to the micro to think about the workplace. Kweilin, if you think about the macro level, and you think about women in the workforce overall globally, what do we see?', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: In terms of paid work, what we see around the world is that women generate about 40 percent of global GDP. They are concentrated more in part-time roles; they have the majority of part-time roles around the world and the minority of full-time roles. They’re also concentrated in lower-productivity sectors. They’re typically more junior in organizations, and there’s also a significant wage gap globally. In the United States about $0.80 on the $1.00 for similar work, and when you compound that for women of color that can be quite a bit lower, $0.60 or so on the $1.00.', 'Simon London: Right. So, fewer women in the global workforce, tending to be congregated in lower-paid occupations. Even if they’re in the same occupation, they’re probably less senior, and even if they’re in the same level of seniority, they’re probably paid less. As an economist, why should I care about that?', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: You should care because it’s a big economic opportunity that we’re missing, to the tune of about $12 trillion around the world. In fact, it would be about $28 trillion if we were to fully match equality in the workplace between women and men across all of those three dimensions.', 'Simon London: If we got to absolute parity in terms of participation, seniority, pay, everything.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: That would be worth $28 trillion, which is an economy the size of the US and China added together, but it’s not realistic anytime in the near term. To account both for near-term progress and potential, but also to account for individual choice, we took a look at what would be a more realistic scenario. We looked across each region and said, “What’s the best rate of improvement we’ve empirically seen happen over the last ten years?”', 'Simon London: This is country by country?', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: Region by region, country by country. In Western Europe, improving at the same rate of Spain across the entire region. In Latin America, improving at the rate of improvement of Argentina. If we did that across each region, that gets us to about 40 percent of the opportunity, or $12 trillion. That would be like adding the UK, Japan, and Germany to the global economy, or about 11 percent of global GDP. It’s a big deal.', 'Simon London: Wow. So, the global economy could be 11 percent bigger in GDP terms if we could get to that more conservative level of progress toward parity?', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: Exactly, and it comes from three places: about 60 percent of it is from more women formally working in the workplace, another 20 percent of it is more women taking full-time roles versus part-time roles, and the last 20 percent of it is sector mix, so concentrating in different sectors.', 'Lareina Yee: In some ways, what we have is a challenge in front of us to say, “How do we help half of the world’s population have better access to participate in the global economy?” That’s where you see the tough challenges. The business case is an easy one.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: Absolutely.', 'Lareina Yee: Then we have to move onto the harder stuff.', 'Simon London: Yes, and that’s the other thing: it’s easy to talk about the economy in the abstract, but the fact is that the economy is underpinned by a great deal of law, social norms, access to services, and personal security. There’s a whole range of social and legal aspects to this that underpin or then give you the outcome in the sense of workforce participation.', 'Lareina Yee: That’s probably one of the reasons why people feel that this is an intractable and challenging problem, in the sense that it is many things. It’s a systemic set of challenges. Kweilin Ellingrud: On a global level, it is a system. You can’t expect to capture your country’s share of the $12 trillion opportunity unless you’re going to tackle the societal barriers that hold women back from participating in the workplace.', 'If you want that economic boost and the growth that we are talking about—which government leaders, companies, and CEOs want—then you have to be willing to tackle the societal gaps. If you plot over 100 countries on both their equality in work and their equality in society, those two things are highly correlated.', 'Simon London: Kweilin, you mentioned a little earlier that there are some big occupational differences between men and women and the sectors in which they participate in the workforce. Why is that important?', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: The fact that work is gendered around the world is important, because there are different wages in the different sectors in which women versus men are concentrated. It’s also important, though, because automation will affect different occupations differently.   Lareina Yee: The big “so what,” for me at least, is that the reason why it matters that our current footprint is gendered in work is that the solutions have to be gendered too.', 'Let’s just think about reskilling—because that’s eventually where we go with this—because there’s a huge opportunity to help women get into the new economy, to help both genders. If I were to apply a solution that helps nurses reskill, and I focus only on the health and social sector where there are mostly women, I would probably miss the type of skills that men need if they have factory jobs and if they have construction jobs.', 'Similarly, if I focus on reskilling with the assumption that most of the jobs are where the men are, I might miss the skills and capabilities that women need. It’s practical that you’re going to need different reskilling for the genders, because they sit in different occupations and jobs.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: One of the factors for being able to participate in reskilling is the ability to travel.', 'One of the interesting things in the research is that it shows that the question of safety is just as paramount for the woman outside of Paris as the woman in India as the woman in the United States.', 'That version of not feeling safe has different specifics, but it’s the idea of, “Do you feel safe between your home and office during your commute, and also within your office or workspace?” That’s everything, from just disrespectful behavior during your commute all the way to physical abuse.', 'Simon London: Yeah, which underlines, again, that you cannot look at the workforce and you cannot look at the economy without considering a lot of these social factors as well.', 'Lareina Yee: Absolutely. It’s looking at your social factors.', 'Simon London: If I had to summarize, we’re saying that, number one, because women in all countries—not just in developing countries—but because women in all countries face a variety of structural barriers to participation in the workforce, it could be harder for women to adapt and adjust, because they may not have the access to education, they may not be quite as mobile, they may not have the access to technology in the same ways.', 'Number two, if you have a reskilling program to deal with automation that was to focus primarily on manufacturing, for example, that would de facto be a gendered approach to dealing with the situation. As a policymaker you need to think about these gender effects too.', 'Lareina Yee: We need reskilling in programs that meet women where they are versus expecting women to come to the programs. Let’s take those examples of women and where they’re working today. We’ve talked about formal work, it goes from 9:00 to 5:00 or something like that. Then they go home, and they take their second shift, and their second shift is the hours and hours they spend in the unpaid care economy.', 'If you’re looking to “dimensionalize” how many hours globally women spend in the unpaid economy, it’s 1.1 trillion. It’s three times more than men. They take their second shift in the unpaid economy, maybe taking care of elderly family members, children. Then on top of that, we want them to take a third shift. The third shift is the reskilling.', 'When we think about how to help them, we also have to make it work for the way their lives work today. If we think that it just works for them to take off three months to join a program, or just to take night classes, it frankly isn’t as simple.', 'Simon London: This is another example of the difficult structural barriers that a lot of women will face as we look at this reskilling that’s necessary to deal with workplace automation.', 'Certain sectors are growing, and there are going to be jobs gained over the next several decades. It’s not just a negative picture. What are the gender effects of that if we look through the sectoral differences? Where’s the growth going to be, and how does that affect men and women?', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: One of the biggest areas (no surprise) that is gaining jobs is healthcare. That is a highly female-dominated sector; over 70 percent of those jobs around the world are held by women. That is largely because of the demographics and those shifts over time that we’re seeing.', 'Lareina Yee: There are also the technology and professional-services sectors, where we’re going to see an enormous amount of growth in jobs—both transformation of the jobs that exist today as well as just net new jobs that didn’t exist a couple of years ago. Think about machine learning and the explosive growth in the types of jobs that there weren’t applications for five years ago. That is exciting, but to the point that Kweilin mentioned at the beginning, we have a gendered footprint to start, and we don’t have as many women participating in the technology and professional-services sectors today. We don’t have as many young girls and young women participating in the education that leads to those pathways.', 'Simon London: Let’s zoom in. Let’s go from the macro to the micro, from the workforce to the workplace. Lareina, when you look at women in the workplace today, and you look at the level of individual organizations and companies, what do you see?', 'Lareina Yee: The statistics, similar to the global economy, are a bit sobering. You have one in five executives at the top that are women. You may start anywhere from 45 percent to 35 percent women at the entry level, depending on the industry sector—and in some sectors, like healthcare, you start much higher, something closer to 70 percent. But at the first promotion you start to see a disparity.', 'In the United States, for example, we know that for every 100 men who receive their first promotion from the entry level to manager, only 79 women receive that same promotion. If you’re thinking about intersectionality, which is a fancy way of saying, for example, “if I’m a female and I’m black,” that number is 60. The disparity starts early, and then it just continues on to the top—to leadership, boards, the CEO, and top teams—where we see few women.', 'Simon London: How much of this is national-specific versus prevalent, at least across Western economies?', 'Lareina Yee: These are trends that we see across the different economies. Now, certainly those dynamics will play out a little differently in countries and cultures and contexts, but the hard metrics look sober in every instance.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: It’s interesting, Lareina, because when that first promotion that you describe, after that much of a drop-off, there’s almost nothing you can do in the rest of the funnel to equalize it at that point.', 'Lareina Yee: No, you can’t run fast enough to the top.', 'Simon London: I think there is this sort of working assumption, particularly from a lot of men, that it’s women leaving the workforce. That they get to a certain point in their career, and they choose to either downshift or they leave the company, and that’s the reason there aren’t as many women in senior-leadership positions. But I think the research shows that is categorially false, right?', 'Lareina Yee: We do not have an attrition problem, no. Men and women are not leaving the workforce at different rates. When women leave, they’re not leaving for the home economy, they’re leaving to go to other companies in the same industry. Men and women leave for similar reasons. Guess what reason they’re not leaving for? They’re not leaving for family. They’re leaving for professional opportunities.', 'Simon London: I think we clearly established why, at the macro level, if you’re an economist or a policy maker, this is something you should care about. For a CEO, just remind us, why should I care about this issue?', 'Lareina Yee: From an economic value-creation perspective, the case is clear. There’s also the fact that you want to reflect the communities and the populations that you’re a part of in a most essential way.', 'If your business doesn’t reflect that, you’re off a beat. There can also be a social responsibility. Increasingly, I think businesses are questioning whether they should be thinking about that in their core strategy. Ultimately, it’s less about the academic reasons and more about a sense of authentic commitment. We know that companies that make that commitment from the top and carry it down through the first-line managers are more successful.', 'So, this can be done, but ultimately we need to act. We need to act both in terms of our policies and the structure, but also in terms of addressing underlying mind-sets.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: I think the companies that I’ve seen make significant progress certainly have a clear tone from the top, as you were describing. But they’re also focused, right? They’re not doing seven initiatives and trying to track the progress over the course of a couple of years. They’re saying, “We’re going to do these two things, and we’re just going to execute the heck out of it. And then we’re going to see where we are in a couple of months, and then we’re going to reevaluate, but spread this quickly.”', 'Lareina Yee: I think some companies are starting to say, “We’re going to be more creative about the tools with which we can effect change.” One of the things that’s been interesting is to watch P&G. They’re saying, “Hmm, maybe we can use our advertising and creative energies to show an image of a more equal world.” They’ve invested disproportionately in different campaigns around their products and showing that. That’s a different tactic or strategy that we haven’t seen others use, which is to say, “It’s not just my internal flexibility-in-HR programs,” it’s, “How do I use my capital, my weight to change the environment for my employees, but also for those outside?”', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: I think that’s just a higher level of maturity in terms of figuring out the impact that you can have in the world—expanding their sights outside the walls of their own company to say, “Upstream and downstream, and with my supply chain, and with my advertising clout, and how I influence the broader world, how do I think about pursuing gender equality with my unique voice and my unique talents?”', 'Simon London: Say a little bit more about what we know works based on the research. We said visible, vocal CEO commitment, number one, a small number of powerful programs, number two. Thinking about how you impact the world through things like your supply base, how you interact with customers, number three. What are the other things that we just know work?', 'Lareina Yee: Data transparency. Using data to understand and have a fact base, and being transparent about where you are. I think another thing that we know works is not to shy away from implementing the basics every single day, year in and year out. There’s something that’s not exciting about that, and you’re going to have to continue to inspire people.', 'Then on top of that, you probably have to challenge some of the conventional norms. Those typically hit at the underlying mind-sets. Some of those are fears, that for jobs within a company or in the economy it’s a zero-sum game, that it’s not an expanding pie. Another one is just the fear of change.', 'Simon London: But, surely, you’ve got to get down to the level of that first promotion. From what you said earlier about the first promotion being absolutely critical in a place of huge attrition for talented women.', 'Lareina Yee: I think it’s both. One thing you find is that when you look at the pipeline, you’re going to have to probably solve two or three major pieces where women fall off. One is, did you bring them through the door in the first place? Second is the first promotion gap, and third is leadership.', 'If you just do one and you’re wondering why you’re not making progress, it’s because you need a systems approach.', 'Simon London: Just to be the devil’s advocate, isn’t the sort of systems approach somewhat at odds with what you were saying, Kweilin, around just needing to pick two or three core initiatives and execute the hell out of them?', 'Lareina Yee: I don’t think it’s at odds. I think what Kweilin is mentioning is consistent to the systems approach, which is, “Let’s take a look at where we lose women, and let’s take a look at where our experiences are unequal, and have targeted sets of things that we do in concert to each other to change the overall playing field and to change the overall culture and environment.” Likely it’s something less than five major things that you’re doing, and it’s not the spaghetti at the wall—it’s more intentional.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: There’s a broad range. Unconscious-bias training or efforts are one of the most common initiatives I think we see. There’s a huge range and difference between companies that do it versus companies that say, “Let’s do the two- or three-hour training in a conference room and call it a day.”', 'The companies that do it work this into their HR and people systems. They might have somebody in a people review who is a devil’s advocate and raises the tough questions to say, “Would we have had that same conversation if that weren’t a woman coming back from maternity leave?” Or, “Would we have had that same conversation if that weren’t a man in the same aggressive leadership style as his successful mentor?” Those are the tough discussions that need to happen. You rewind that from the promotion discussion all the way to the entry point, and what we see is that there is still both conscious and unconscious bias even at the initial resume screening.', 'Simon London: Can we just segue to the inclusion part of diversity and inclusion? It feels—in a good way—as if the conversation has shifted a little bit over the last several years toward inclusion and inclusive cultures. Just talk a little bit about why that is. For people who may not have considered this, what is the difference between diversity and inclusion?', 'Lareina Yee: The simplest way to think about is that diversity is often counting the number of people represented and inclusion is the experience that they have, how they feel. It’s one thing to bring a woman to the table, but does she feel that she can bring her whole self, her best self? Does she feel that she belongs at that table and that she’s connected to the people around her? You need both. You need the participation and the experience.', 'Because inclusion is the fundamental basic that you need in your culture. What’s interesting about inclusion is that it’s not just for women. If you work in a world of extroverts, and you’re an introvert, do you feel that you can be part of that discussion? I’m just using that as an example, but the concept is inclusion, which is not gender based.', 'Inclusion is for both men and women, and for people that come from different backgrounds, and have different ways of processing and thinking. The underlying belief is that if you put a diversity of viewpoints at the table together, and if all of them are working together, you’re going to get better answers.', 'Simon London: Right, but they have to feel included for that to happen, that’s the point. It’s no good just doing the diversity and getting the count right. It’s more about the dynamic of how people feel around the table.', 'Lareina Yee: Absolutely.', 'Simon London: So again, if I’m a CEO, and I want to create an inclusive culture within my organization, what are some of the things that I need to pay attention to?', 'Lareina Yee: One of the things that we know is important is the impact of microaggressions. People ask, “What are microaggressions?” It is the fact that women are more likely to be perceived as more junior than they are. Their judgment is more likely to be questioned, they are less likely to be defended if their work is questioned. They’re less likely to be given professional opportunities for growth. There’s a string of things that happen each and every day to women.', 'You would say each individual piece isn’t worth having a huge discussion about, but what you realize is, the cumulative effect is that women are standing on a field that’s significantly lower than men. When we say there’s an uneven playing field, this just gives us some specifics and examples of that.', 'Simon London: It’s the everyday slights, if you like.', 'Lareina Yee: It’s the everyday slights. What a CEO or a manager can do is to start to lead differently. It’s about changing the culture, and it’s creating a place where those slights don’t happen, and where people feel, as a result, that they’re more included and that they belong more.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: I think the other thing a CEO can do is drive that accountability from the overall level down by business unit, by function, and ask, “What are we doing to move the needle?” Also empower managers, because you don’t quit your CEO, right, you quit your immediate manager because they can’t make the flexibility happen. So empowering managers to handle, for example, an awkward situation or sexual harassment, those types of tough conversations are important. Then on the positive side, empowering them to make flexibility day to day, so that you can manage your life, is important as well.', 'Lareina Yee: Over time, when we’ve interviewed women executives, one of the things we’ve seen in the data overall is that women feel more isolated. What we find is that when we ask women, “Do you believe that your gender has gotten in the way of future opportunities?” More than a quarter of the women, will say, “Yes, absolutely. I think it’s something that will hold me back going forward, and I think it’s something that has held me back before.”', 'Simon London: Is this one of the reasons that we advocate clustering women? [To mitigate] this issue of being the only woman, for example, in a meeting or on a team?', 'Lareina Yee: Well, it’s one of the strategies that companies have been increasingly looking at: if you can create teams where there’s a critical mass of women. If she can see it, she can be it. There’s a leader who’s a woman, there’s a more diverse leadership team, there are more women that they’re appearing with—it creates a better experience.', 'Simon London: Something else that jumped out at me in the research is this big disparity between line roles and staff roles. Just say a little bit more about that, Kweilin.', 'Kweilin Ellingrud: It’s interesting, because that “one in five women in the C-suite”—I think that belies a balance of power. Women are much more likely to have a staff role. If you look at S&P 500 CEOs who were promoted from within over the last few years, somewhere between 99 and 100 percent of them from year to year are promoted from running the biggest P&L [profit and loss] to that CEO role. If we want to shift the 6 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs who are women, we need to shift that balance between staff and line roles that are held by women.', 'Lareina Yee: There’s something happening between an early manager and an SVP [senior vice president], where you see a small percentage of women able to stay in the power-alley roles, which typically are those that run the P&Ls of the business. One piece of advice I always give to women is, “Stay in the line.”', 'Simon London: Do we know why it’s so difficult for women to stay in those line roles?', 'Lareina Yee: Some of it is that as they hit the childbearing years where family becomes a bigger priority—and that’s not for everybody, but that’s for many women—they often will take support roles, maybe because those are the opportunities that are offered to them that allow them to stay at full-time work, but also allow them to have a slightly different pace.', 'Or maybe because that’s where they see more role models and they see more support. I think that businesses can be far more creative and thoughtful about how to retain women in the line roles.', 'There is a CEO of a healthcare company who said that one of the things he would do is that he would personally intervene and say, “You have the potential to be the head of the business, and you are about to go on maternity leave for your second child. I heard that you want to take this finance role, and all I’m saying is, I’m giving you a return ticket back into the line role. You need to bring this ticket to me after a couple of years when you’re ready to come back, because it is going to be hard to pull you back, and we’re going to pull you back in.”', 'Simon London: Right. It reminds me almost of on-ramps and off-ramps, which people typically talk of in the context of maternity leave, for example. But it’s within the business. It’s an on-ramp and an off-ramp to line roles.', 'Lareina Yee: Absolutely. The on-ramp and off-ramp time period tends to be incredibly short. We’re just thinking about the first three months when someone comes back, and we’re thinking that they only have one child. We’re not thinking about the impact of being parents, for both men and women, over the course of, say, nine years, as you have three children. We’re not thinking about the total impact and how you continue to progress your career, and how you continue to advance, and that you may go through a set of years where even as a guy, you would like to take a job that’s less focused on being promoted and more focused on staying in the role that you have, and then you’re willing to upshift a couple years later.', 'Simon London: Yeah.', 'Lareina Yee: Which is why some companies are reevaluating the type of support that you give for parents. To think through, “How do we support parents in terms of childcare, in terms of career flexibility, in terms of de-risking the ability to take some of the flexibility programs that are offered?” One of the things that we know is that there are many programs for flexibility, but nobody takes them. Why don’t they take them? Because they think it’ll hurt their careers.', 'By the way, there are a lot of men who want their systems to change. For them, the big step is to de-risk the concept, “You can participate in these programs as well.” I do think that there’s reframing [that needs to happen]: from “we do all of this to help women” to “we do all of this to help our overall people.” Often women are, as that quote will say, the canaries in the coal mine. They’re the first population in a company that we see, but quickly companies need to think about how the types of programs and innovations help everybody.', 'Simon London: Thank you. Really appreciate it.', 'Lareina Yee and Kweilin Ellingrud: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you, our listeners, for tuning in to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

How to organize healthcare is one of the hottest political issues of our time. Every country is struggling to find the right balance between social provision and market forces, to find the optimal number of payers and providers, and to figure out how all the different pieces should fit together.', 'Stepping back, we see that health systems in every country, at least in developed economies, face common challenges. Populations are aging, the burden of disease is shifting from infectious diseases to long-term chronic conditions, and then there’s the onward march of technology. Not only the eye-catching clinical technologies but also information technology that could make health systems orders of magnitude more efficient, if only they could be deployed at scale. The upside is enormous; the degree of difficulty is very high.', 'To discuss these thorny issues, I sat down in Chicago with Penny Dash, who is a former practicing physician turned McKinsey senior partner, based in London, and Shubham Singhal. Shubham is a senior partner based in Detroit and the global leader of McKinsey’s Health Systems and Services Practice.', 'Penny and Shubham, welcome to the podcast. Thank you for doing this.', 'Penny Dash: Thank you for having us.', 'Shubham Singhal: Pleasure to be here.', 'Simon London: Without going too deep into the challenges facing any one country, if you look across the OECD [Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development], look across developed economies, Penny, what are some of the common challenges facing health systems?', 'Penny Dash: We tend to say that the challenges are actually very common across all those different healthcare systems. Despite having very different regulatory systems, despite having different payer–provider systems, the challenges are remarkably consistent.', 'The challenges are, first of all, an aging population—in many ways that’s a great thing, we’re all living longer. But we are having a different burden of disease than the burden of disease that we would’ve seen 20 years ago and certainly 50 years ago and 100 years ago. What we are now seeing is that people don’t tend to die as children of infectious diseases. They don’t tend to die during their adult years of infectious diseases, they don’t tend to have accidents as much. If they have a heart attack, we can usually treat it and cure it and people survive. As a result, the diseases that we’re seeing are chronic diseases associated with aging populations, but also with poor lifestyle behaviors.', 'Simon London: I had to look this up as a piece of terminology to make sure I had it, a chronic condition is basically defined as something long-term, right?', 'Penny Dash: It’s something that you live with, but it may be something that you die with, so it’s a condition that you have for a long time. As long as we effectively manage it—so you either take the right drugs or you modify your diet or your behavior—then it’s something you could have for ten years, 20 years, 30 years, or indeed, longer.', 'Simon London: Diabetes, cardiovascular, depression, certain things like that.', 'Penny Dash: Absolutely. As you just raised, mental health is increasingly one of the big challenges that sits within that. As people get older, it starts to become frailty, so it may be arthritis, it may be chronic back pain, and of course, dementia is an increasing challenge.', 'The key thing is that all of those require a very different type of healthcare than the healthcare model we would’ve seen 20, 30, 40 years ago, to deal with the things that one might call more acute illnesses. The more acute illnesses of having an accident, having a major infection, having a heart attack, are all things that we deal with in a hospital setting.', 'This different set of diseases need a continuum of care. They need care typically organized around you and around your life, they need care that focuses on your lifestyle, focuses on your health behaviors, focuses on your broader well-being, but also, crucially, requires healthcare that is proactive rather than reactive. That is a completely different mind-set both for caregivers as well as for the different infrastructures and the systems and the mechanisms that deliver healthcare. That is a major challenge for all developed countries: how to shift from this reactive, hospital-based model, to a more proactive, community-based model.', 'Simon London: It’s not just that we need more care, it’s that we need different types of care as well, so there’s a sort of structural adjustment required.', 'Penny Dash: Absolutely. The third challenge is that the costs of healthcare are escalating. They’re escalating partly because of an aging population—particularly an aging population with more of these chronic diseases—but they’re also escalating because we are developing more and more technology, which is very exciting.', 'We have more technology, we have more complicated treatments for more people, but we have also seen quite a significant increase in the unit cost of many of the components of healthcare, whether that’s the unit cost of a stent, or the unit cost of a doctor or a nurse, or indeed of a building. Healthcare is quite a capital-intensive industry.', 'Simon London: Shubham, let me bring you in here. I am somebody who is a long way from the sector in terms of really understanding the intricacies, but it feels like a classic productivity problem in some ways, at least.', 'We need more healthcare, better healthcare, different types of healthcare, but we need more healthcare for less, because that ultimately is going to be the only way to sort of get a grip on the cost issues, the spending issues. Would you agree with that? Is that a sensible and appropriate way to think about it?', 'Shubham Singhal: There’s a little bit of nuance that exists underneath that. I think if you pick up from what Penny said, you’ve got three kinds of issues. The first issue is you have built up a high fixed-cost infrastructure that is no longer entirely relevant. It’s relevant in parts, we still need some of it, but we built a hospital-based infrastructure, which required people that got sick, we brought them in, they got well, we sent them out. If we now have to do continuous care, how are we going to do that?', 'Normally, in other industries, what would happen is the old models would go away—through bankruptcy or other ways—and new ones would emerge.', 'That is not how it works in healthcare. These are very important pillars of the community, these are places where people go for care, lots of people are employed. It’s not the easiest of things to do. Even in the United States, which is often nimble at restructuring industries, the bankruptcy code that exists in the United States for every company doesn’t apply to healthcare.   Simon London: The gales of creative destruction are not going to apply to healthcare in the same way that they apply to the widget industry.', 'Shubham Singhal: When you think about productivity, the first part of this is restructuring. We don’t have a mechanism to restructure. There’s a second part of it, which Penny also mentioned, around technology. It is fascinating, in almost every other industry, the application of technology over time, not instantly, but over time, leads to more being delivered for less.', 'Not so in healthcare. Some amount of it is because healthcare is complicated. New treatments that come out, the R&D that is required, that has to be recovered, that is definitely true. But some of it is also partly because of the previous point in the creative destruction, and the lack of a lot of disruptive change—you don’t get step-change improvement and productive business models that would be that much better than the previous one.', 'There is something about how do we, while delivering the right quality of care and the safety and the like, create the incentives to drive productivity, labor productivity, so we can do more?', 'Penny Dash: I think what sits behind this in pretty much all countries is that it’s an emotive subject, and it’s an emotive subject for individuals, it’s an emotive subject for families, it’s an emotive subject for communities, and it’s certainly an emotive subject for politicians.', 'While there are absolutely opportunities for a disruptor to come in, and there are examples of disruptors globally, so there are examples of organizations or individuals who have said, “We can deliver this same treatment at higher quality and for lower cost.” The implication of that would be that they would essentially win, and that the old would lose.', 'It’s not anything that most people are willing to do. On an individual level, you may feel completely comfortable buying a new laptop that gives you better computing power at lower cost, and you’ll absolutely make that transaction. Most people equate the highest cost, the most traditional form of healthcare delivery, with the better quality. Often erroneously, but that is what they do.', 'Shubham Singhal: Picking up on that, it’s interesting because it gets in the way of technology-driven productivity improvement. We all know technology. We buy a new phone, it’s going to have a glitch or two, the patch will come out, we’re going to fix it. Now, how many of us are going to be comfortable having somebody get care where it glitched while their loved one was getting that care and say, “Oops, we’re going to fix it.” It just is not something that we can all wrap our heads around.', 'Simon London: Yeah, and that is legitimate.', 'Shubham Singhal: That is extremely legitimate from a standpoint of safety and quality, so there are good reasons that get in the way of saying we can apply the same. But it does create, under the legitimate umbrella, a general sense of not wanting to change or disrupt as well. Even when disruptors come out, it’s hard for them to scale.', 'Simon London: Thinking about this through a layperson’s lens while accepting that there are legitimate reasons why we might not want the gales of creative destruction to blow through the healthcare sector in the same way as the other parts of the economy, you’d step back and say, “Is one of the issues here transparency?” If people had the information, and they knew that what they took to be the Rolls-Royce or Cadillac version of care didn’t deliver better outcomes than something less expensive, they might choose it. As a healthcare consumer, those things are not always apparent.', 'Penny Dash: It’s been about 30 years since people started to call for greater transparency in healthcare. There has been a move towards greater transparency, and you can now, in many countries, find a website that will give you some sort of ratings of performance of hospitals and doctors and so on and so forth. It is still not actually scientifically, technically, quite as robust as it could be.', 'There are some reasons as to why it perhaps hasn’t quite taken off in the way that it could. One of the issues is how you adjust for case mix. Often the best surgeons will take on the most complicated cases, and de facto then they might have a slightly higher mortality rate than the less good surgeon who takes on the easy cases. You need to take in to account that case mix adjustment. While you can do that, it’s quite clunky and it’s quite complicated, so that is one reason.', 'The other reasons, though, are quite interesting. One is an awful lot of doctors, and indeed, hospital managers, administrators, as well as politicians, have been very resistant to greater transparency.', 'The third thing, though, which is fascinating, is how few patients actually look at this stuff. Some research shows people spend more time choosing where they go for breakfast or where they go for dinner than they spend looking at “Is this surgeon actually any good?” It’s quite fascinating the degree to which people don’t do that. I think that’s transparency on the quality side. Then the other bit is transparency on the cost side. In some ways, transparency on the cost side, one could argue, would be a much more rapid driver of change, but the reality is most consumers do not see the cost.', 'It’s usually coming at them in a proxy way. Either it’s coming through their health insurer or it’s coming through government and so on. As a result, if you took some of these examples, most consumers do not know whether their hip prosthesis, for example, cost $3,000 or whether it cost $300. Therefore, the decision about which one of those hip prostheses is used is down to the individual surgeon, the individual institution, and very occasionally, the payer.', 'Shubham Singhal: I’d add a couple of things. One is on the cost side. Transparency has to be contextual. My mother has just had a knee replacement. There was absolutely no way, when picking the surgeon and the institution, to be able to know what the total cost would be. Even now, as the bills arrive, they arrive from the anesthesiologist and the physician and the facility and the walker and the pharmacy that gave the drugs, et cetera.', 'There is no obvious way in which we can figure it out today, because of the way these institutions are organized. If you were to even bring it back to, in the chronic disease, where we need this to be kind of continuous care, we don’t have a way to be able to engage the person continuously around their lives.', 'Even the best of chronic disease management today is, “Well, we’ll call you up. We’ll set up every three months.” Maybe if you had multiple chronics, somebody shows up to your house, but we haven’t quite knit together the caregivers, the technology, and the monitoring to be able to make something easy for the person. To say, “We see that certain metrics are deviating from what we would expect them to be. This means you should either show up, you should go to the ER, or you should go somewhere else, and by the way, these are the three we picked for you, given your location that are closest and cost X,” and so on. We don’t have an ecosystem that is intuitive, personalized, and available around the person.', 'Simon London: I mean, are we basically saying that one of the reasons that the healthcare system doesn’t work very well or doesn’t operate very transparently as a market for consumers is it’s just so darn complicated? There are so many piece parts of it. It is just hard to figure out. Is that the gist?', 'Shubham Singhal: It is the gist, and just to add to it, given in most developed economies, it is a primarily third-party paid system. It is designed for the professionals and the industry more so than it is designed for the consumer.', 'Simon London: Let’s segue back to technology because we talked about very exciting clinical technology, which is true, and we read about them, we heard about them. I would have thought that there’s a lot of nonclinical technology—electronic health records being the obvious example—data ecosystems, cloud computing, a lot of quite granular robotic process automation, things that you hear about in other aspects of the service industries, that could be applied here if there was a will and if the investment was there, to, if not immediately fix, but over time solve a lot of these issues.', 'Shubham Singhal: I think technology exists. I might beg to argue about whether there’s enough money available. Just take the United States, the stimulus bill put out $20 billion for EHRs and technology, and we did electronify everything and spend all kinds of money.', 'Simon London: EHRs being electronic health records.', 'Shubham Singhal: Correct. But back to the industry structures that exist, while the data, by law, is supposed to be the consumer’s, good luck trying to get that data for yourself, let alone aggregate it across different sites of care. If you showed up at doctor A, hospital B, and pharmacy C, you have no way to aggregate that around yourself, and in effect, the custodians of the data, which are the technology systems working on behalf of the providers, have made these very siloed. It’s gone from being in their files in their basement to being on servers that are dedicated to them.', 'The clinical data is electronic in most countries, and so it’s a matter of do we have the right regulatory construct in place that makes it a patient-centric, longitudinal, complete data set versus institution-centric? That’s where I think there is immense promise. Because two or three things happened. One, it moves the power away from the industry to the consumer, because they have the data, their ability to use that to delegate to whoever, or people on behalf of them.', 'The ability for us to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and being able to look at that data and sort out what the interventions may be, some of which may not be clinical at all. It may be around the person needs food, the person needs to have a place to call home.', 'It could be any number of things in which we could intervene that could prevent adverse health events from happening. There’s a significant opportunity to refashion healthcare to make it work around the person with the data that we have, all of these technologies that exist today. Then the means for engagement that exist; in developed countries, almost everyone has a smartphone and the ability to be able to interface with people across a full continuum, from virtual in their home to a community-based site to, if needed, bringing them into a hospital, is all possible to do.', 'Simon London: Are there countries that are further ahead in this? I mean, if you look across the world, which are the countries that seem to be furthest forward?', 'Penny Dash: If you go to Sweden, you go to Finland, it’s now completely normal for an older person with dementia to maybe wear some sort of tag around their neck, or a bracelet, or to put it into their watch, or whatever it may be, that allows you to set off an alarm that says, “This older person with dementia is now leaving their home or leaving their premises.”', 'Now, that is a ridiculously simple intervention, which, prior to that would’ve required 24 hours a day, seven days a week monitoring of that person with dementia to make sure they don’t go off wandering and put themselves in danger. A simple sort of tagging device gives you quite a significant productivity opportunity.', 'Probably most countries in Europe now, as well as here in the US, are now starting to offer some sort of online booking, whether it’s to see your primary-care physician or to make a hospital appointment and so on. That is a significant productivity opportunity. Even in the UK, which has significantly fewer administrative staff than we have here in the US, a typical hospital in the UK would still employ 300 people just to make outpatient bookings and bookings for elective surgery.', 'Another good example that is starting to happen is things like linking up availability in imaging centers for X-rays. For example, this is now starting to happen in a couple of cities in the UK, so rather than you waiting to try to get an appointment, to have an X-ray, or a CT scan, or an MRI at one hospital, you can actually say, “I’ll be available for any hospital in this city.”', 'Then you can have an alert system that says, “We got a cancellation for tomorrow.” Now, that is both great for me as a user, I don’t have to wait three weeks to get this test, which is good, but also it means that we increase the utilization of those slots. If you look utilization of any procedure in healthcare anywhere in the world, utilization is woeful.', 'If you actually looked at how most doctors in particular spend their days, an enormous amount of their day is capturing information that has already been captured somewhere else. It is around sharing information that you could’ve shared electronically. If you mapped out the typical way in which many doctors in particular spend their working hours, which are a very precious commodity, there’s a significant opportunity to really help them to become more efficient and more effective.', 'Simon London: There’s a lot of productivity hidden within the daily work routines or schedules of clinicians, but also nonclinical professionals that could be unlocked, and they might even welcome being unlocked.', 'Shubham Singhal: The other interesting aspect of this that we’re getting to now is the ability to expand our access to care. Take rural populations, for example. It is quite difficult to ensure that the right clinicians are available. If you look at it with all the technology that we have now, you could have a less credentialed person—could be a nurse, could be, in some cases, just a primary-care physician—you could have either the physician, in the case of the nurse, or the specialist, in the case of the primary-care physician, be available remotely. That’s another way in which we could gain productivity while extending access and being able to reach and touch and be able to provide care to more individuals.', 'There is some interesting productivity to be had, as we think about what the makeup of the spending the time that the physicians spend, and then what the makeup of the caregiver is that we need to bring together to be able to deliver to the patient.', 'Simon London: Penny, I know you do a lot of work with hospitals in particular. What’s the hospital of the future going to look like, and how long is it going to take us to get there?   Penny Dash: We’re starting to see some of it evolve now, we’re starting to see some development. I think for all the reasons that we’ve said before, we probably need fewer hospitals despite an aging population. We need fewer beds, we need fewer operating theaters and so on. We definitely need a lot more technology. We are, interestingly, over the last 20 to 30 years increasing sub-specialization, creating some centers of excellence. For the reasons that Shubham’s just said, I think actually some of that may change, and we will see the ability to provide more care at a local level, networked into the more specialist centers.', 'I think some of that trend towards centralization is starting to be reversed slightly. I think we could see some radical differences in what happens to you when you’re in a hospital. The first is, I think, absolutely it will become much more tech-enabled. Everything is RFID [radio-frequency identification] tracked, all of your vital signs and investigations go directly online.', 'I think we’ll absolutely see monitoring devices. The concept of the nurse coming around and taking your blood pressure every four hours I think will be gone in the next five years, and everyone will just be connected to a monitor and it will all be automatically connected. We will start to see things like pills and patches on your body that will, again, start to do a lot of that in an automatic way. One of the things I think would be the much more radical change in the future will be around robotics.', 'One of my more radical assertions is that in ten years’ time, 15 years’ time, maybe 20 years’ time, that the concept of putting hands inside a body will be seen as remarkably weird. Large chunks of surgery now—cholecystectomy, prostatectomy, and so on—many of those things are now done through noninvasive surgery. I think that’s just going to grow and grow and grow.', 'Shubham Singhal: I think I just wanted to add a couple of things. One is, with all this information available inside a hospital, already a number of them are beginning to apply artificial intelligence.', 'Even being able to predict that the indicators are showing, and some tests have shown, four hours earlier before the patient begins to decline, and being able to intervene, is a significant opportunity that exists.', 'Simon London: Artificial intelligence, it’s interesting. We’re just talking about very good pattern recognition, right?', 'Shubham Singhal: Indeed.', 'Simon London: Across very large patient populations, and the ability to spot patterns that are probably beyond the ken of the most educated human physician.', 'Shubham Singhal: Indeed.', 'Penny Dash: That’s one of my big hopes, is how do we harness without compromising confidentiality, the fact that we have eight billion people on the planet with largely similar physiology, but with some subtle differences. How we start to really use big data and analytics to spot trends, to spot that this combination of, you know, so Penny Dash with whatever genetic makeup, if Penny Dash doesn’t get enough sleep each night and goes and does this, this, and this, will put herself at higher risk of this particular disease.', 'If she did sleep an extra hour at night, and she did eat more green vegetables and so on, she may then put herself at much lower risk of that disease. That is all feasible now, today.   Simon London: Just. It’s a huge just. It requires the data to be available in formats that can be combined in databases to which one can apply AI.', 'Penny Dash: It also requires an economic model, and that’s one of the quite interesting challenges in some of this, is who is going to do that research. Who has the economic interest to want to know it benefits me to take on this pattern of activities and so on? That’s quite an interesting thing about the whole big data and analytics in healthcare. We haven’t quite worked out the economic model: Who’s doing it for what benefit?', 'Shubham Singhal: I think that will depend on different systems, and how care is paid for and constructed. If you follow all of this through, the interesting thing where it leads you is the care part of healthcare. If and when we’re able to do all of these things, we will be able to have every one of the healthcare providers spend more time on care.', 'The physician can be unhurried, and the nurse can spend more time not trying to read 15 monitors but instead helping the patient with empathy-based care, and other care extenders, whether it’s a nutritionist who’s needed, et cetera, can be available to help people.', 'The interesting thing, in some sense, is people often think about productivity as a negative term, that we somehow are going to lose jobs. In fact, I would argue, it has the potential to enrich the jobs that exist and allow for us to fund additional jobs that are needed to be able to help the patient, which is what healthcare is about. That’s the other part of the optimism that I have, which is it becomes more personal and it becomes more care than things that get done to the human body.', 'Simon London: Fifteen percent of health outcomes are determined by clinical care, and the standard and quality of clinical care that you have. The rest of it is genetics, behaviors, and the socioeconomic factors. Do we as a society spend too much time and energy on the clinical side of it, and actually not enough time on those other factors?', 'Shubham Singhal: I think we do, and in some sense, healthcare is designed as sick care, essentially, and it was very clinical in nature and we’ve got a specialized profession, of course.', 'I think what we are learning more and more is that we need to not separate these out and put them together, because when you follow the continuum these factors are indeed very important.   An old person that has a couple of chronic diseases could be just fine if they have a set of friends, or family around, because they’re feeling good. They get food, and they go out and eat at the right times. They get sleep. They are mentally doing well. Or, they could easily—a factor that we may not monitor—be lonely. That may lead them to have depression. That may lead them to not go to the grocery store. That may lead them to not have food. That may lead their blood sugar to go awry. That would lead them to the ER. Four other complications later, it could be a $70,000 event.', 'Simon London: It’s the social determinants of health.', 'Shubham Singhal: That is extremely important. But as the society ages, it also is simple things like loneliness. A whole lot of people do not have the family infrastructure that perhaps might have once existed. If they are alone, if their friend passed away and their friend circle now is smaller, all of those things can create a very predictable pattern of how that person’s health would deteriorate. How do we help solve for that? It could be as simple as somebody, in this case, an unpaid volunteer worker who comes and spends some time and plays games with them or reads poetry with them.', 'You could imagine interventions as simple as that, that would avoid the progression that we might see over time. Again, I come back a little bit to our ability to have the data and understand what’s going on is quite significant.', 'Penny Dash: I think European countries have a longer history of recognizing some of the wider socioeconomic determinants, and hence, perhaps a greater focus on less income inequality, a greater focus on education, a greater focus on social housing and so on and so forth, and also have, I think, gone a bit further than probably the US has in looking at things like social prescribing. Social prescribing is now quite a common thing in many countries in Europe, whereby a primary-care physician would prescribe a set of classes at the local gym, might prescribe for you to go on a walking holiday, for example.', 'Simon London: Before we run out of time, a big takeaway, again, as a layperson, from this conversation is there are potentially some amazing clinical-technology breakthroughs of which genetics is one. The application of artificial intelligence in clinical settings is another. I mean, all of those things are amazing and will help. But there is an awful lot of basic technology blocking and tackling around transparency, clinical efficiency, scheduling, a lot of these things which are much less glamorous and deserve an awful lot of attention. Again, this is almost irrespective of how you choose, as a country, to organize your health system. It doesn’t matter how many payers and providers you’ve got, a lot of these are common challenges. Again, the optimistic view may be there’s a lot of upside.', 'Penny Dash: Oh, enormous amount of upside. It could be so much better.', 'Shubham Singhal: Definitely.', 'Simon London: Well, Penny, Shubham, thank you so much.', 'Shubham Singhal: Thank you, sir.', 'Penny Dash: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you, our listeners for tuning in to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

59,How to master the seven-step problem-solving process,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-to-master-the-seven-step-problem-solving-process,Structured problem solving can be used to address almost any complex challenge in business or public policy.,"['Structured problem solving can be used to address almost any complex challenge in business or public policy.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with Charles Conn, CEO of venture-capital firm Oxford Sciences Innovation, and McKinsey senior partner Hugo Sarrazin about the complexities of different problem-solving strategies.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. What’s the number-one skill you need to succeed professionally? Salesmanship, perhaps? Or a facility with statistics? Or maybe the ability to communicate crisply and clearly? Many would argue that at the very top of the list comes problem solving: that is, the ability to think through and come up with an optimal course of action to address any complex challenge—in business, in public policy, or indeed in life.', 'Looked at this way, it’s no surprise that McKinsey takes problem solving very seriously, testing for it during the recruiting process and then honing it, in McKinsey consultants, through immersion in a structured seven-step method. To discuss the art of problem solving, I sat down in California with McKinsey senior partner Hugo Sarrazin and also with Charles Conn. Charles is a former McKinsey partner, entrepreneur, executive, and coauthor of the book Bulletproof Problem Solving: The One Skill That Changes Everything [John Wiley & Sons, 2018].', 'Charles and Hugo, welcome to the podcast. Thank you for being here.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Our pleasure.', 'Charles Conn: It’s terrific to be here.', 'Simon London: Problem solving is a really interesting piece of terminology. It could mean so many different things. I have a son who’s a teenage climber. They talk about solving problems. Climbing is problem solving. Charles, when you talk about problem solving, what are you talking about?', 'Charles Conn: For me, problem solving is the answer to the question “What should I do?” It’s interesting when there’s uncertainty and complexity, and when it’s meaningful because there are consequences. Your son’s climbing is a perfect example. There are consequences, and it’s complicated, and there’s uncertainty—can he make that grab? I think we can apply that same frame almost at any level. You can think about questions like “What town would I like to live in?” or “Should I put solar panels on my roof?”', 'You might think that’s a funny thing to apply problem solving to, but in my mind it’s not fundamentally different from business problem solving, which answers the question “What should my strategy be?” Or problem solving at the policy level: “How do we combat climate change?” “Should I support the local school bond?” I think these are all part and parcel of the same type of question, “What should I do?”', 'I’m a big fan of structured problem solving. By following steps, we can more clearly understand what problem it is we’re solving, what are the components of the problem that we’re solving, which components are the most important ones for us to pay attention to, which analytic techniques we should apply to those, and how we can synthesize what we’ve learned back into a compelling story. That’s all it is, at its heart.', 'I think sometimes when people think about seven steps, they assume that there’s a rigidity to this. That’s not it at all. It’s actually to give you the scope for creativity, which often doesn’t exist when your problem solving is muddled.', 'Simon London: You were just talking about the seven-step process. That’s what’s written down in the book, but it’s a very McKinsey process as well. Without getting too deep into the weeds, let’s go through the steps, one by one. You were just talking about problem definition as being a particularly important thing to get right first. That’s the first step. Hugo, tell us about that.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: It is surprising how often people jump past this step and make a bunch of assumptions. The most powerful thing is to step back and ask the basic questions—“What are we trying to solve? What are the constraints that exist? What are the dependencies?” Let’s make those explicit and really push the thinking and defining. At McKinsey, we spend an enormous amount of time in writing that little statement, and the statement, if you’re a logic purist, is great. You debate. “Is it an ‘or’? Is it an ‘and’? What’s the action verb?” Because all these specific words help you get to the heart of what matters.', 'Simon London: So this is a concise problem statement.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Yeah. It’s not like “Can we grow in Japan?” That’s interesting, but it is “What, specifically, are we trying to uncover in the growth of a product in Japan? Or a segment in Japan? Or a channel in Japan?” When you spend an enormous amount of time, in the first meeting of the different stakeholders, debating this and having different people put forward what they think the problem definition is, you realize that people have completely different views of why they’re here. That, to me, is the most important step.', 'Charles Conn: I would agree with that. For me, the problem context is critical. When we understand “What are the forces acting upon your decision maker? How quickly is the answer needed? With what precision is the answer needed? Are there areas that are off limits or areas where we would particularly like to find our solution? Is the decision maker open to exploring other areas?” then you not only become more efficient, and move toward what we call the critical path in problem solving, but you also make it so much more likely that you’re not going to waste your time or your decision maker’s time.', 'How often do especially bright young people run off with half of the idea about what the problem is and start collecting data and start building models—only to discover that they’ve really gone off half-cocked.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Yeah.', 'Charles Conn: And in the wrong direction.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Yeah.', 'Simon London: OK. So step one—and there is a real art and a structure to it—is define the problem. Step two, Charles?', 'Charles Conn: My favorite step is step two, which is to use logic trees to disaggregate the problem. Every problem we’re solving has some complexity and some uncertainty in it. The only way that we can really get our team working on the problem is to take the problem apart into logical pieces.', 'What we find, of course, is that the way to disaggregate the problem often gives you an insight into the answer to the problem quite quickly. I love to do two or three different cuts at it, each one giving a bit of a different insight into what might be going wrong. By doing sensible disaggregations, using logic trees, we can figure out which parts of the problem we should be looking at, and we can assign those different parts to team members.', 'Simon London: What’s a good example of a logic tree on a sort of ratable problem?', 'Charles Conn: Maybe the easiest one is the classic profit tree. Almost in every business that I would take a look at, I would start with a profit or return-on-assets tree. In its simplest form, you have the components of revenue, which are price and quantity, and the components of cost, which are cost and quantity. Each of those can be broken out. Cost can be broken into variable cost and fixed cost. The components of price can be broken into what your pricing scheme is. That simple tree often provides insight into what’s going on in a business or what the difference is between that business and the competitors.', 'If we add the leg, which is “What’s the asset base or investment element?”—so profit divided by assets—then we can ask the question “Is the business using its investments sensibly?” whether that’s in stores or in manufacturing or in transportation assets. I hope we can see just how simple this is, even though we’re describing it in words.', 'When I went to work with Gordon Moore at the Moore Foundation, the problem that he asked us to look at was “How can we save Pacific salmon?” Now, that sounds like an impossible question, but it was amenable to precisely the same type of disaggregation and allowed us to organize what became a 15-year effort to improve the likelihood of good outcomes for Pacific salmon.', 'Simon London: Now, is there a danger that your logic tree can be impossibly large? This, I think, brings us onto the third step in the process, which is that you have to prioritize.', 'Charles Conn: Absolutely. The third step, which we also emphasize, along with good problem definition, is rigorous prioritization—we ask the questions “How important is this lever or this branch of the tree in the overall outcome that we seek to achieve? How much can I move that lever?” Obviously, we try and focus our efforts on ones that have a big impact on the problem and the ones that we have the ability to change. With salmon, ocean conditions turned out to be a big lever, but not one that we could adjust. We focused our attention on fish habitats and fish-harvesting practices, which were big levers that we could affect.', 'People spend a lot of time arguing about branches that are either not important or that none of us can change. We see it in the public square. When we deal with questions at the policy level—“Should you support the death penalty?” “How do we affect climate change?” “How can we uncover the causes and address homelessness?”—it’s even more important that we’re focusing on levers that are big and movable.', 'Simon London: Let’s move swiftly on to step four. You’ve defined your problem, you disaggregate it, you prioritize where you want to analyze—what you want to really look at hard. Then you got to the work plan. Now, what does that mean in practice?', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Depending on what you’ve prioritized, there are many things you could do. It could be breaking the work among the team members so that people have a clear piece of the work to do. It could be defining the specific analyses that need to get done and executed, and being clear on time lines. There’s always a level-one answer, there’s a level-two answer, there’s a level-three answer. Without being too flippant, I can solve any problem during a good dinner with wine. It won’t have a whole lot of backing.', 'Simon London: Not going to have a lot of depth to it.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: No, but it may be useful as a starting point. If the stakes are not that high, that could be OK. If it’s really high stakes, you may need level three and have the whole model validated in three different ways. You need to find a work plan that reflects the level of precision, the time frame you have, and the stakeholders you need to bring along in the exercise.', 'Charles Conn: I love the way you’ve described that, because, again, some people think of problem solving as a linear thing, but of course what’s critical is that it’s iterative. As you say, you can solve the problem in one day or even one hour.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Yeah.', 'Charles Conn: We encourage our teams everywhere to do that. We call it the one-day answer or the one-hour answer. In work planning, we’re always iterating. Every time you see a 50-page work plan that stretches out to three months, you know it’s wrong. It will be outmoded very quickly by that learning process that you described. Iterative problem solving is a critical part of this. Sometimes, people think work planning sounds dull, but it isn’t. It’s how we know what’s expected of us and when we need to deliver it and how we’re progressing toward the answer. It’s also the place where we can deal with biases. Bias is a feature of every human decision-making process. If we design our team interactions intelligently, we can avoid the worst sort of biases.', 'Simon London: Here we’re talking about cognitive biases primarily, right? It’s not that I’m biased against you because of your accent or something. These are the cognitive biases that behavioral sciences have shown we all carry around, things like anchoring, overoptimism—these kinds of things.', 'Both: Yeah.', 'Charles Conn: Availability bias is the one that I’m always alert to. You think you’ve seen the problem before, and therefore what’s available is your previous conception of it—and we have to be most careful about that. In any human setting, we also have to be careful about biases that are based on hierarchies, sometimes called sunflower bias. I’m sure, Hugo, with your teams, you make sure that the youngest team members speak first. Not the oldest team members, because it’s easy for people to look at who’s senior and alter their own creative approaches.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: It’s helpful, at that moment—if someone is asserting a point of view—to ask the question “This was true in what context?” You’re trying to apply something that worked in one context to a different one. That can be deadly if the context has changed, and that’s why organizations struggle to change. You promote all these people because they did something that worked well in the past, and then there’s a disruption in the industry, and they keep doing what got them promoted even though the context has changed.', 'Simon London: Right. Right.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: So it’s the same thing in problem solving.', 'Charles Conn: And it’s why diversity in our teams is so important. It’s one of the best things about the world that we’re in now. We’re likely to have people from different socioeconomic, ethnic, and national backgrounds, each of whom sees problems from a slightly different perspective. It is therefore much more likely that the team will uncover a truly creative and clever approach to problem solving.', 'Simon London: Let’s move on to step five. You’ve done your work plan. Now you’ve actually got to do the analysis. The thing that strikes me here is that the range of tools that we have at our disposal now, of course, is just huge, particularly with advances in computation, advanced analytics. There’s so many things that you can apply here. Just talk about the analysis stage. How do you pick the right tools?', 'Charles Conn: For me, the most important thing is that we start with simple heuristics and explanatory statistics before we go off and use the big-gun tools. We need to understand the shape and scope of our problem before we start applying these massive and complex analytical approaches.', 'Simon London: Would you agree with that?', 'Hugo Sarrazin: I agree. I think there are so many wonderful heuristics. You need to start there before you go deep into the modeling exercise. There’s an interesting dynamic that’s happening, though. In some cases, for some types of problems, it is even better to set yourself up to maximize your learning. Your problem-solving methodology is test and learn, test and learn, test and learn, and iterate. That is a heuristic in itself, the A/B testing that is used in many parts of the world. So that’s a problem-solving methodology. It’s nothing different. It just uses technology and feedback loops in a fast way. The other one is exploratory data analysis. When you’re dealing with a large-scale problem, and there’s so much data, I can get to the heuristics that Charles was talking about through very clever visualization of data.', 'You test with your data. You need to set up an environment to do so, but don’t get caught up in neural-network modeling immediately. You’re testing, you’re checking—“Is the data right? Is it sound? Does it make sense?”—before you launch too far.', 'Simon London: You do hear these ideas—that if you have a big enough data set and enough algorithms, they’re going to find things that you just wouldn’t have spotted, find solutions that maybe you wouldn’t have thought of. Does machine learning sort of revolutionize the problem-solving process? Or are these actually just other tools in the toolbox for structured problem solving?', 'Charles Conn: It can be revolutionary. There are some areas in which the pattern recognition of large data sets and good algorithms can help us see things that we otherwise couldn’t see. But I do think it’s terribly important we don’t think that this particular technique is a substitute for superb problem solving, starting with good problem definition. Many people use machine learning without understanding algorithms that themselves can have biases built into them. Just as 20 years ago, when we were doing statistical analysis, we knew that we needed good model definition, we still need a good understanding of our algorithms and really good problem definition before we launch off into big data sets and unknown algorithms.', 'Simon London: Step six. You’ve done your analysis.', 'Charles Conn: I take six and seven together, and this is the place where young problem solvers often make a mistake. They’ve got their analysis, and they assume that’s the answer, and of course it isn’t the answer. The ability to synthesize the pieces that came out of the analysis and begin to weave those into a story that helps people answer the question “What should I do?” This is back to where we started. If we can’t synthesize, and we can’t tell a story, then our decision maker can’t find the answer to “What should I do?”', 'Simon London: But, again, these final steps are about motivating people to action, right?', 'Charles Conn: Yeah.', 'Simon London: I am slightly torn about the nomenclature of problem solving because it’s on paper, right? Until you motivate people to action, you actually haven’t solved anything.', 'Charles Conn: I love this question because I think decision-making theory, without a bias to action, is a waste of time. Everything in how I approach this is to help people take action that makes the world better.', 'Simon London: Hence, these are absolutely critical steps. If you don’t do this well, you’ve just got a bunch of analysis.', 'Charles Conn: We end up in exactly the same place where we started, which is people speaking across each other, past each other in the public square, rather than actually working together, shoulder to shoulder, to crack these important problems.', 'Simon London: In the real world, we have a lot of uncertainty—arguably, increasing uncertainty. How do good problem solvers deal with that?', 'Hugo Sarrazin: At every step of the process. In the problem definition, when you’re defining the context, you need to understand those sources of uncertainty and whether they’re important or not important. It becomes important in the definition of the tree.', 'You need to think carefully about the branches of the tree that are more certain and less certain as you define them. They don’t have equal weight just because they’ve got equal space on the page. Then, when you’re prioritizing, your prioritization approach may put more emphasis on things that have low probability but huge impact—or, vice versa, may put a lot of priority on things that are very likely and, hopefully, have a reasonable impact. You can introduce that along the way. When you come back to the synthesis, you just need to be nuanced about what you’re understanding, the likelihood.', 'Often, people lack humility in the way they make their recommendations: “This is the answer.” They’re very precise, and I think we would all be well-served to say, “This is a likely answer under the following sets of conditions” and then make the level of uncertainty clearer, if that is appropriate. It doesn’t mean you’re always in the gray zone; it doesn’t mean you don’t have a point of view. It just means that you can be explicit about the certainty of your answer when you make that recommendation.', 'Simon London: So it sounds like there is an underlying principle: “Acknowledge and embrace the uncertainty. Don’t pretend that it isn’t there. Be very clear about what the uncertainties are up front, and then build that into every step of the process.”', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Every step of the process.', 'Simon London: Yeah. We have just walked through a particular structured methodology for problem solving. But, of course, this is not the only structured methodology for problem solving. One that is also very well-known is design thinking, which comes at things very differently. So, Hugo, I know you have worked with a lot of designers. Just give us a very quick summary. Design thinking—what is it, and how does it relate?', 'Hugo Sarrazin: It starts with an incredible amount of empathy for the user and uses that to define the problem. It does pause and go out in the wild and spend an enormous amount of time seeing how people interact with objects, seeing the experience they’re getting, seeing the pain points or joy—and uses that to infer and define the problem.', 'Simon London: Problem definition, but out in the world.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: With an enormous amount of empathy. There’s a huge emphasis on empathy. Traditional, more classic problem solving is you define the problem based on an understanding of the situation. This one almost presupposes that we don’t know the problem until we go see it. The second thing is you need to come up with multiple scenarios or answers or ideas or concepts, and there’s a lot of divergent thinking initially. That’s slightly different, versus the prioritization, but not for long. Eventually, you need to kind of say, “OK, I’m going to converge again.” Then you go and you bring things back to the customer and get feedback and iterate. Then you rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. There’s a lot of tactile building, along the way, of prototypes and things like that. It’s very iterative.', 'Simon London: So, Charles, are these complements or are these alternatives?', 'Charles Conn: I think they’re entirely complementary, and I think Hugo’s description is perfect. When we do problem definition well in classic problem solving, we are demonstrating the kind of empathy, at the very beginning of our problem, that design thinking asks us to approach. When we ideate—and that’s very similar to the disaggregation, prioritization, and work-planning steps—we do precisely the same thing, and often we use contrasting teams, so that we do have divergent thinking. The best teams allow divergent thinking to bump them off whatever their initial biases in problem solving are. For me, design thinking gives us a constant reminder of creativity, empathy, and the tactile nature of problem solving, but it’s absolutely complementary, not alternative.', 'Simon London: I think, in a world of cross-functional teams, an interesting question is do people with design-thinking backgrounds really work well together with classical problem solvers? How do you make that chemistry happen?', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Yeah, it is not easy when people have spent an enormous amount of time seeped in design thinking or user-centric design, whichever word you want to use. If the person who’s applying classic problem-solving methodology is very rigid and mechanical in the way they’re doing it, there could be an enormous amount of tension. If there’s not clarity in the role and not clarity in the process, I think having the two together can be, sometimes, problematic.', 'The second thing that happens often is that the artifacts the two methodologies try to gravitate toward can be different. Classic problem solving often gravitates toward a model; design thinking migrates toward a prototype. Rather than writing a big deck with all my supporting evidence, they’ll bring an example, a thing, and that feels different. Then you spend your time differently to achieve those two end products, so that’s another source of friction.', 'Now, I still think it can be an incredibly powerful thing to have the two—if there are the right people with the right mind-set, if there is a team that is explicit about the roles, if we’re clear about the kind of outcomes we are attempting to bring forward. There’s an enormous amount of collaborativeness and respect.', 'Simon London: But they have to respect each other’s methodology and be prepared to flex, maybe, a little bit, in how this process is going to work.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: Absolutely.', 'Simon London: The other area where, it strikes me, there could be a little bit of a different sort of friction is this whole concept of the day-one answer, which is what we were just talking about in classical problem solving. Now, you know that this is probably not going to be your final answer, but that’s how you begin to structure the problem. Whereas I would imagine your design thinkers—no, they’re going off to do their ethnographic research and get out into the field, potentially for a long time, before they come back with at least an initial hypothesis.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: That is a great callout, and that’s another difference. Designers typically will like to soak into the situation and avoid converging too quickly. There’s optionality and exploring different options. There’s a strong belief that keeps the solution space wide enough that you can come up with more radical ideas. If there’s a large design team or many designers on the team, and you come on Friday and say, “What’s our week-one answer?” they’re going to struggle. They’re not going to be comfortable, naturally, to give that answer. It doesn’t mean they don’t have an answer; it’s just not where they are in their thinking process.', 'Simon London: I think we are, sadly, out of time for today. But Charles and Hugo, thank you so much.', 'Charles Conn: It was a pleasure to be here, Simon.', 'Hugo Sarrazin: It was a pleasure.

There is an oft-quoted statistic that about 70 percent of organizational-change programs fail to meet their objectives. This sobering fact actually comes from McKinsey research of a few years ago. And of course, it invites the question from executives, “Is there anything we can do to radically increase the chances that our change program will succeed?” The good news is, that yes, based on years of additional research and experience, we can say categorically that there is a way to flip the odds.

The book is actually a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the original Beyond Performance: How Great Organizations Build Ultimate Competitive Advantage [John Wiley & Sons, 2011], reflecting a decade of additional research into the science of organizational change.', 'To find out more, I caught up in Chicago with the authors of Beyond Performance 2.0, McKinsey senior partners Scott Keller and Bill Schaninger.', 'So, Scott and Bill, you’ve both done this before, but welcome to the podcast.', 'Scott Keller: Great to be here.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thank you for having us.', 'Scott Keller: Thanks for having us.', 'Simon London: You’ve written a book about organizational change, change management. And I think you would concede there are a lot of books out there on this topic. So why add to the pile?', 'Scott Keller: The promise of transformational change, which people use as a phrase often, what do they really mean by that? One analogy we use from nature about what people are trying to get at is the analogy of the caterpillar to a butterfly. And, why is that transformational change and not just change like you change your tires, you change your shirt, you change your shoes.', 'The key thing we think about in that kind of transformational-change environment is, you think about a caterpillar to a butterfly, this thing can’t go back. To achieve change on the order of magnitude where it truly is a fundamental shift in how our organization operates that’s self-perpetuating and self-improving upon, that just from a professional standpoint to help organizations and to help human beings achieve that level of change, that gets really exciting.', 'That’s the type of change we’re talking about in the book. Everyone sets out for a caterpillar-to-butterfly change. You look at ten people in a room, and you say, “Great, you’re going to go do this. Oh, by the way, seven of you are going to kind of waste your time.” It’s not good enough for our clients. “It’s not good enough for humankind” is sort of an underlying ethos of what we have. And so our view is, is there something new under the sun to share in the space? And we think there is. So why this book amidst all that, is because it actually says something different and something that we know works.', 'Simon London: There’s this number that gets kicked around a lot, like rule of thumb: 30 percent of big change efforts succeed; 70 percent, frankly, don’t meet their targets. That’s what you’re talking about when you’re talking about the numbers and the success rates.', 'Bill Schaninger: We are. There’s a known set of things. It’s not mystical. That you can get that number, a likelihood of success up closer to 80 percent, but it’s not easy. It does require resilience and “stick-to-itiveness.”', 'And also it’s not simple like, oh, one bullet’s going to fix it. The more units you have, you have more people identifying with something smaller and smaller pieces that aren’t the overall entity. Now you’re trying to get all these people to do something different.', 'At its core, there’s the metachange, which is the organization has to be faster. It has to make more money. Or it has to spend less, or it has to come out with new product lines quicker, all those sorts of things that are normal. One step underneath that, you go, “Oh wait, we do have 200,000 employees in 50 countries.”', 'How are we going to get them to do this? That’s the essence of it. The essence that the organization, itself, while an interesting construct, works or fails whether or not you get every individual in the organization to think and behave differently in a sustained manner in pursuit of something common.That’s the hard part.', 'Simon London: So just to clarify because it’s quite a big claim, that we think that if an organization follows the approach outlined in the book, they can get their odds of success up from the 30 percent closer to 80 percent.', 'Scott Keller: I would say we are reporting the facts when we say that. If the answer was 50 percent or if the answer was 33 percent, we would be bound to report the facts. We are saying that. Absolutely.', 'Bill Schaninger: The type of research we’ve done now over a decade, 2,500 organizations—had stayed in academics and not joined McKinsey, I would’ve been the toast of academia for this data set.', 'These findings are spectacular in a way that says, “Hey, actually there’s an interesting relationship here.”', 'Simon London: So let’s get to the meat. What’s the big idea?', 'Scott Keller: The big idea, if you want to see an increase from the 30 percent success rates to the 79 percent success rates, if you want to see caterpillar-to-butterfly results in terms of your change management, is to do what we call putting equal emphasis on the performance and the health elements of the change program you’re leading. Let me talk about each of those.', 'First, on the performance side of things, this is what you’re doing to deliver the operational and financial results that you’re looking for. If I use a manufacturing example, this is what you’re doing to buy things cheaper or of higher quality. It’s what you’re doing to make them into something else, more efficiently or more effectively. It’s what you’re doing to sell them into the market and service them better than you would have before.', 'Simon London: The changes you’re making to your operations, broadly defined.', 'Scott Keller: Absolutely. It’s really the what of what you’re doing. Most leaders can get their head around that and say, “Yes. I know what I want to do when I take over this department or this business or this company in terms of what needs to be done to improve performance.”', 'What doesn’t often happen is that they put equal emphasis, time, effort, rigor, into the health side of the change. What’s the health side? The health side is how do I align the organization on the direction we need to go? How do we execute in that direction with minimal friction in the system? How do we create a sense of meaning and renewal that fuels and perpetually improves the organization as we go? Performance is kind of the buy, make, sell side, then health is the align,execute, renew side of the change.', 'What organizational health is is it’s a way to measure and manage that alignment, execution, and renewal as you’re doing the work of the what—quite frankly, in an integrated way, which is what we’ll get into when we talk about the methodology. Most leaders, by the way, when you share that with them, are intuitively like, “Yeah, I mean, of course, we need to align the organization on the direction. We need to execute without friction in the system.”', 'Simon London: You’ve got to address the people stuff.', 'Scott Keller: We’ve got to do that. But if you ask them, “Well, what would you do with 50 percent of your time if you’re going to do that stuff?”', 'After town halls and memos, most people run out of like, well, I don’t know. Which is where Beyond Performance 2.0 comes in is because it’s a tool kit and a playbook for how you manage the people side of the equation with equal discipline and rigor to how you’d manage the what, or the performance side.', 'Simon London: All right. So let’s talk a little bit about the change journey. In the book, you described it as being, basically, in five phases or stages. 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             The five stages (and the questions that must be answered in each of them) are aspire (where do we want to go?), assess (how ready are we to go there?), architect (what must we do to get there?), act (how do we manage the journey?), and advance (how do we continue to improve?).\\r               \\r \\r  Just elaborate on that a little bit.', 'Scott Keller: Any change journey typically follows kind of an S-curve. That journey can be broken up, and we break it up into five stages.', 'The first stage is the aspiration stage. It’s where you’re actually trying to go. It sounds pretty basic, but you’ve got to have an answer both on the performance side—what are our strategic objectives? And on the health side—what are our health goals? It’s less clear to a lot of leaders on how do you set health goals. Once you’ve got that, you’ve got a great kind of light on the hill, if you will.', 'That’s our aspiration. What’s an often-missed step and why our change journey has five steps instead of three, which a lot of them do. A lot of times you’ll hear, “You know, hey, diagnose, design, deliver.” Once you have that light on the hill, it’s absolutely imperative that you take stock of your change readiness to go there [which is step two, assess].', 'The skill and will of your organization or the capabilities and mind-sets is the way we talk about it. That gives you a lot more information in terms of what you’re going to need to do when you get to step three, which we call the architect stage. In the architect stage, you’re actually creating the plan. And then you’ve got what we call the act stage, which is the fourth stage.', 'Now that stage actually takes most of the time. That’s the steep part of the S-curve. You’re actually doing those things you planned to do, or you’re building the blueprint that you created. You are asking people to ride the bike while they’re changing the tires. You are asking them to do more, so there’s a lot of work to be done in that act phase in terms of being able to adjust as you go and to be able to manage the energy during the process. That’s stage four.', 'Then you get to the fifth stage [advance], which is, again, why we have five often missed, which is you get to the top of that S-curve. Many change programs have a pretty big infrastructure to help drive them because this is an extraordinary act of increasing the metabolism of the organization.', 'There are PMOs [project-management offices] or transformation officers. There’s a whole set of infrastructure. There’s a whole set of the way communications work. To just dismantle those and to kind of let everything go back to where it was is typically a recipe for that S-curve not to look like an S but to look like a mound.', 'Things will revert back to the way they were before. To thoughtfully transition into a stage of continuous improvement is what that advance stage, that last stage, does.', 'Bill Schaninger: At the end of that fourth and fifth stage, you’re looking back and saying, “Actually, we’re permanently changing the operating model. We’re permanently changing the cadence and tenor and tone of management meetings and who gets to be in management.” It is as close as we can get to the switch to the butterfly because you dismantle all the old stuff.', 'Simon London: So let’s assume I’ve done my aspiration both on the performance side and on the health side. I’ve got a sense of where I want to go, the kind of critter I want to be as an organization. What goes into that second stage?', 'Scott Keller: Stage two is really the crux of why we believe we achieve truly transformational change in that caterpillar-to-butterfly sense. It’s that step two that when missed, people miss the opportunity for that fundamental shift in how an organization approaches work.', 'Bill Schaninger: If you lay out the scale of the change that’s necessary on the performance side and some of the things that you should be doing seem obvious, then we should ask the question, “Why would an otherwise well-intended person not already be doing it?” You could have the people who are buying the equipment in procurement talk to the frontline operators who are using the equipment in the field. You get a blank stare and an “Oh, why would we do that?”', 'So this idea of mind-sets and prevailing sentiments, if you think about when people behave, you know, they’re not robots. They are all trying to solve for something. But particularly when you get to the lack of adoption of things that seem obvious, it does tend to break into things where it’s not clear to them that they’re allowed to do it, or they don’t believe that they can either through time or resources, which is really just saying a priority thing. Or they don’t want to. Sometimes the want to do stuff is really sticky, and it’s intractable. Scott has a spectacular way of doing this with top teams where we can tease out some of these “I-don’t-want-tos” because that gets into the world of power, influence, legacy, relationships, just wanting to be liked and accepted. There’s a lot of smart people who have been derailed by those things.', 'Simon London: Do you find that senior execs, CEOs are often reluctant to tackle mind-sets?', 'Scott Keller: Yes. We find that’s the case, and [that is] because it’s, typically, the one they feel less equipped to add value or drive in terms of knowing what to do. It also feels a bit like, “Are we putting our employees on the couch and being armchair psychologists here?”', 'However, once they’re introduced to a robust tool kit, there’s an interview technique called laddering that is used. There’s a number of focus-group techniques that leverage visual cues as opposed to kind of traditional let’s-just-talk-about-it type things that really surface underlying thought processes.', 'There’s also a whole level of what they call QDA, qualitative data analysis. Most people are familiar with word clouds. That’s a very simple version of qualitative data analysis. You can run a number of analyses that can give you lots of good cues and good evidence for what underlying mind-sets might be in an organization. Then the last thing, I think, when you play it out for leaders just in terms of practical—how does this actually work and why would you tend to it—most leaders are onboard right away.', 'Let me give you an example. Let’s say your strategic objectives are we want to double share price. How are we going to do that? We’re going to cross-sell more, bring the whole firm to our clients or the whole company to our customers. Essentially, that’s the strategy. That’s your strategic objective.', 'What are your health goals? Let’s just say the analysis takes you to the health objectives of let’s increase customer focus, let’s get more knowledge sharing, let’s improve how we do performance management—these changes to how we run the place that’ll make the biggest difference.', 'We just finished the aspire stage. Now in that assess stage, on the performance side, you’re going to assess capabilities. Do we have the capabilities we need? If not, where can we get them? You’re going to get really sharp on that.', 'Well, let me go to the health side because this is the mind-set piece. When you play this through, what would most companies do if they just went straight to action if they need more knowledge sharing? Most companies would look for the companies who do this well. They would find that most of those companies have a large information infrastructure, kind of a portal that you can upload data on and download data on.', 'Simon London: Yeah, that’s not so with knowledge management.', 'Scott Keller: Totally. They would invest hundreds of millions of dollars potentially building this knowledge infrastructure. What would most companies do for performance management? Similar, they’d look at best practice. They’d find that the years of the annual performance review and long-winded forms are done. They would go to form-light, regular-basis conversations, and they’d say, “OK, that’s going to really help us on performance management.”', 'Customer focused, they’d say, “Well, what do great customer-focused, sales-oriented organizations do? They have salespeople who profile customers really well and understand their needs. They also know the product set really well, and so they match those two. Let’s build scripts for our salespeople to ask the right questions, let’s educate them on knowledge.” That’s going to cost a ton of money to do all that. It might be the right thing to do.', 'To Bill’s point, why are smart, hardworking people who are generally well intentioned not sharing knowledge today? You do the laddering interviews. You do the focus groups using some visual cues and different techniques. You do the QDA. Pretty quickly, you find, wow, here’s the way people think. They might not consciously think it. But they’re introduced into and indoctrinated into a culture where the mind-set that predominates is that knowledge is power: “If I share my knowledge, I lose my advantage; if I share my knowledge, I find places for other people to poke holes and see what’s going wrong; my goal is to not share any knowledge; my goal is to use the knowledge I have to actually let my performance be better than the next person.”', 'Now if you put in a big knowledge-management system and the mind-set is knowledge is power, people will give it lip service. They’ll fulfill the KPIs [key performance indicators]. I submitted three things last month. And they’ll never share anything of value.', 'They’ll never draw on it for anything because they’ll know it’s useless. Now if you shifted the mind-set to, “Your power in the organization is proportional only to the extent to which you share your knowledge”—if that was the mind-set, you probably wouldn’t need the technology infrastructure. You probably would have people self-organizing into centers of excellence saying, “Hey, let’s share how we do this purchasing thing across the world. Let’s share best practices.” They would find out who knows what, and they would get on the phone. You still might put in a system, but it’s a completely different result.', 'Let me take the other two just because it really brings it to life. Performance management: if people think, “You know what, giving people real feedback is a fast track to destroying relationships,” no one wants to hear it. I’m not going to be the person who’s going to do that. I want everyone to like me because that’s a totally different mind-set than a mind-set that says, “Real relationships have a foundation of honesty.” That’s the only way to establish real trust with people. If you approach a performance review with that mind-set, it kind of doesn’t matter what the forms are. It’s just going to be a different conversation.', 'With salespeople, there are people who believe, “My job is to give the customer what they want.” It’s not a bad mind-set. A smart, hardworking, well-intentioned person could very well believe that. That’s kind of their operating system. Great salespeople say, “My job is not to be a subordinate to the person across from me, to kind of be the order taker, to give them what they want. My job is to add value in this conversation. My job is to help them understand what they really need.” I don’t need a script if that’s my mind-set because I will ask all of the questions that the company wants me to be asking. I will find out the product information. As soon as you get into this mind-set realm, you get to the root cause of why smart, hardworking, well-intentioned people aren’t already behaving in the way that you want them to behave from a management-practice standpoint. You’ve unlocked the key to transformation because if you can shift that mind-set, people can’t go back.', 'Simon London: OK. But the downside of this is that once you’ve unlocked the Pandora’s box of mind-sets, then you’ve got to change those mind-sets. Let me put this to you, Bill. When you come to the stages that follow, when you come to the architect and act, what’s the trick? Actually how do you change mind-sets across an organizations? That sounds like a mighty hard challenge.', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, I think one of the things that Scott was getting at there is that once you unlock it, you can’t unknow it. You have to do something about it. It’s also you’re not doing 20 of these. In that case, actually really understanding what everyone knows was important, because you’d work on that one.', 'I spent a ton of time with heavy-industrial companies where capital allocation and capital productivity was important. We discovered that along their seven-step, beautiful process was seven steps of padding.', 'What it really came down to, when you teased it out, was that it was better to be predictably mediocre than to be usually brilliant and occasionally really wrong. If you were to look at that kind of idea, a normal distribution of performance would be to be aggressive, push for what your really can, drive for value, drive for reliability. Every once in a while, because it’s a distribution by math, you’re going to have something on the other side of tail, and that should be OK. Because we condition people this way.', 'No one rolls into your employment and is automatically thinking that way. They’re conditioned. You said, “How do you architect it?” The essence of architect on the health side in a framing that we call the “influence model” is really simple. People have traits. That’s who they are. It’s their personality. It’s their competencies. It’s their aptitude. That’s all there. Then they go into an environment. That environment is created by you, the people who run the place. Then those two things come together, and it creates a state, and state increases the likelihood that you’re going to behave in a certain way.', 'Now that’s the psychobabble part of it. But architect is about creating an environment that dramatically increases the likelihood that you will change how you think and behave. That’s why you pick a relatively small number of these: management practices, the ethos you want adopted, stated mind-sets that you’d like to be brought forward. You say, “OK. What’s the best way we know how to change this environment?” Four pretty simple buckets really help people understand why you’re asking them to do what you want them to do, why it’s important. And make sure you stick with it until they actually have some conviction.', 'You don’t need people singing from the rooftops right out of the gate. You do need to have enough, though, that when you’re not watching, they’re going to try it. They’re going to do it. Adoption is a big deal. Storytelling is a big part of this, so is making sure that they hear the story with an ear toward something that matters to them, their sense of meaning.', 'It can’t just be about the stock price. For many people, it has to be about customers, the community they’re in, their colleagues, their business unit. It might even have to be, “What does this mean for me?” There are a whole lot of rules in a workplace: the formal mechanisms, the operating model, the processes, the systems. But in short, it’s how resources are allocated, and it’s how decisions are made. Who’s involved, how fast, and with what repercussions? If you want people to change their behavior and change what they think is important, make it easy to comply. So many times we’ll say to people, “I want you to act like an owner; be entrepreneurial.” Then you force them to get 12 signatures to hire an assistant. That would be inconsistent. That is an early, early proof test for the employees of the organization to look at leaders and go, “You’re actually not serious.”', 'That’s the first two: the understanding and conviction and the formal mechanisms. Then we think about, “Do they have the skills they need?”Most people look at something and go, “Well, if I put forth the effort, how likely is it I’m going to get the result that they want and I want? What’s the reward I’m going to get or the outcome? And does that mean anything to me?” Most people don’t want to run into brick walls.', 'They want to believe that the work they’re working on is important, is material; the outcomes matter; and, by the way, they have a chance in heck of being successful. The beauty of that, of course, is people also don’t want to think it was a Hail Mary pass—in American football parlance. They don’t want to think it was chance. If it does work, they want credit for it. They also don’t want “mission impossible.” Find a balance.', 'Interestingly enough, we talked about formal mechanisms, beyond the process of target setting. The actual target is hugely impactful to motivation, strong enough to be stretched, strong enough to show it’s new and matters. But it can’t be so far out that people, the minute they see it, go, “Well, that’s not mine.” That’s crazy. You have to believe you have a chance.', 'The last one is role modeling. And this one, actually, between the two books, we’ve learned quite a bit about because I would say that, historically, we’ve been disproportionately focused on the value of the cascade, the leader, change leaders. They’re still all very important. But, increasingly, as we are a workforce comprised of a generation that has a lot of their actions that are digitally based, we’ve had to come to grips with the idea that influencers and opinion leaders and people in the social network, their role modeling matters way more.', 'You still need the formal leader to set out the North Star, but the validation cycles and the encouragement cycles are also coming from these influencers. Being able to know who’s in that and who matters, it’s a huge deal to generating real role-modeling reinforcement, saying, “Hey, this matters. We’re going to do it. And you should do it, too.”', 'Simon London: So those four elements of the influence model—understanding and conviction, reinforcement and formal mechanisms, giving people confidence in the skills that they need, and then the role modeling—if you put those four things together, we think we can address a small number of critical mind-sets. It’s doable. It’s knowable, how to do it.', 'Scott Keller: It’s important that all of those be done in concert. Let me run the analogy of a soccer game—football, to our international folks—and an opera house. Let’s say on Friday night, you go to the opera house. During the best part of the performance, a big crescendo at the end of the opera, what do you do in the audience to show your appreciation? Well, you likely give a genteel clap.', 'Now let’s go to the next night. You’re at the soccer finals, and your favorite team’s playing. They’re now tied, and the time is about up. A fullback steals the ball and makes a fullback run and does this amazing crossover toward the front of the goal. And it’s this big header, and it doesn’t actually go in because it hits the crossbar. But then it bounces off the back of one of the other team’s players, and then it’s in the goal, and your team wins. What do you do at the best part of the performance? Probably not a genteel clap. You’re going to be jumping up and down, throwing your cup, hugging, high-fiving, whatever. What if you had that behavior in the opera house at the best part of the performance? Well, you’d never do it. Why would you never do it? Because the role modeling is totally different. The story around the cultural significance of this event is totally different. By the formal mechanisms, you’ll get thrown out of the opera.', 'In this particular example, you probably have the capability and skills to do either one. But employees during change are caught somewhere between a football stadium and an opera house, and it’s a totally confusing place to be. The story says football stadium, but the formal reinforcement and the consequences say opera house. The role modeling says opera house, but then the training I’m getting says football stadium. The idea is to work all four together to make it clear: “Hey, on this mind-set and these set of behaviors that relate to it, we’re in an opera house now, people.”', 'Bill Schaninger: By social norms, even if you don’t have a rule—I mean, in some cases, you have a rule, in some cases you don’t have a rule—you’ve just been told, “We don’t do that around here.” It’s unbelievable how, over generations of employees, that impacts how people behave.', 'Simon London: It’s striking me, there’s a common theme here around asking people. How do you find out what mind-sets are? You need to ask people. You need to do structured interviews, laddering techniques, these kind of things. But, ultimately, you need to talk to the people to understand what the people are feeling and how they’re thinking. You’d have to do that.', 'Scott Keller: You do. You have to have an approach, a methodology, an expertise, to not just tell them the time by looking at their watch. What gets exciting is, people could never pick the management practices that typically the predictive analytics will show are the management practices to focus on. People typically are not conscious of the mind-sets that are kind of underlying the culture—or the unlocks. When you elevate these, what you get is this really wonderful feeling in the organization. Bill’s felt it, too. It’s this, “Finally we’ve surfaced the real stuff. We’re actually having real conversations.', 'Bill Schaninger: There’s one thing I want to add about that because there’s a legacy of old human-dynamics consultation, or even some of the old process consultation. A lot of that would’ve been divorced from the performance side. We used to do a ton of safety work and reliability work in plants. Sometimes you’d find organizations that had allowed themselves to fall into this idea that cost effectiveness was the enemy of safety and reliability. It’s the classic false trap. Sometimes you’d start a conversation and say, “Well, you know, the safest plant is the one that’s not running.”', 'Surely we don’t mean that. But we might be really saying, “We need a plant that’s safe, makes products reliably on spec, and actually has an opportunity to turn a fair margin to justify the capital,” because in those places, it’s like a couple billion dollars of capital on the ground. We’re just trying to get them to handle that we’re not willing to sacrifice, but there is an “and.” It’s not an “either–or.”', 'Simon London: That hints at a failure mode here: that even if an organization and senior management accepts they need to be working on the performance side and the health side, they’ve got to be working at it together. These aren’t two separate workstreams with separate teams that aren’t talking to each other. Is that something that we see in practice?', 'Scott Keller: Yes. It absolutely is. And it’s a huge failure mode.', 'When performance is thought of as, “That’s what our business leaders are going to do,” and health is, “Hey, can the head of HR sponsor that?,” and it’s run largely as, “That’s the HR stuff, and this is the business stuff,” that never ends up going well.', 'Bill Schaninger: Never works.', 'Scott Keller: Starts out fine.', 'Simon London: It’s all business.', 'Scott Keller: It’s all business. It’s an integrated steering-committee approach, sponsorship approach. Again, nothing against HR—HR has a wonderful role to play in all this. But it’s not solely the domain of HR, nor is performance solely the domain of the CFO, for example.', 'Bill Schaninger: In fact, now, when we see the setup, the antennae immediately go up, and we go, “No, actually, we’d like you to put a BU [business-unit] leader in there with the head of HR. By the way, we’d like the head of talent to be over in those two performance initiatives because, frankly, you have no idea how your people are going to start doing that.”', 'Scott Keller: In the beginning of these large-scale change programs, there typically is a health team and a performance team working together. By the time you get to that phase three, where you’re architecting the program, and by the time you get into the act stage, for sure, it’s actually indistinguishable to the employees who are experiencing this what’s performance and what’s health.', 'Those four levers for shifting mind-sets that Bill talked about, you literally would take all of your performance initiatives, and you would ask all of those to build into their plans, “How are you improving our health using these levers to get at those practices and those mind-sets that we need?”', 'Then it turns out, the work of performance does the work of health for you. Everyone’s experiences on how health can actually improve performance are like, “Wow, this actually going really well, and we’re getting great results. Who would’ve thought?”', 'Simon London: So if you had to think about other failure modes, even for organizations that, on the surface, get that they’ve got to be working on two sides at once, they’ve got to be addressing performance and health, what are the things where you see organizations typically will go wrong?', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, two come to mind for me. One is if you get an economic shock during the period of the effort, and you resort to type—the first time you have to announce a surprise, you know, to the markets. You go, “OK, we’re stopping all this, and we’re going just to cost or something else.” So you deviate. That would be one. The other, I think, is tolerance of a leader who is just not living up to it. They know where they all are. Everyone knows everything, particularly leaders who aren’t really living up to the what we’re calling here “health aspiration.” They’re just not behaving the way that you want them to.', 'Simon London: Well, and this is the role modeling.', 'Bill Schaninger: One hundred percent. You will immediately signal, this really isn’t that important. There are others, but those two [are critical] to me. The first test is always going to come, and will you carry people who aren’t living up to what it means to be a leader in that organization?', 'Scott Keller: Yeah. I’ll just add a couple. First of all, we really hoped, in a way because we thought it would be counterintuitive and kind of push the envelope, that we could say, “Actually, you know, the role modeling of the CEO or the top team is far less important than what we all thought.”', 'It turns out, it’s just as important as what we all thought, if not more. We sometimes describe it as the “gear-reduction theory of management,” which is, you’ve got a big gear that can turn one direction, one way, one click, and then a littler gear beneath it—you know, at the next level. It kind of goes three or four clicks, and you go down. The next one’s spinning, and you go all the way to the front line. You’ve got this “bzzz!” just because of one little decision or comment up at the top.', 'Simon London: Yeah, the signaling.', 'Scott Keller: Then the CEO or the senior leader kind of decides to go backward one click. Actually, I didn’t mean that. So there’s shearing beneath it. It’s a visual metaphor for the power of senior leadership in organizational life. A senior leader not being onboard is a massive failure mode.', 'The second failure mode is, to what extent can you make it personal for people, make the change personal? What do we mean by that? Let me give you an example. If you ask men age 20 to 30, “Are you in the top half of male athletic capability,” you know, 93 percent will say, “Yeah. This guy.”', 'That makes sense, actually, because people have a natural self-serving bias to think they’re already doing what needs to be done. You want more knowledge sharing, more customer focus, better performance management.', '“Scott, how are you going to change?” “Oh, I’ll change.” But, secretly, I’m like, “I’ve already got this. It’s everyone else’s problem. If only they would just change.” How do you shift it to, “Hey, for things to change, first, I must change?”', 'How do I get it to be, “My role needs to be to be even better because I need to role model the ability to change, not just that which we need to change to”? All of the kind of blame mentality or below-the-line mentality for those who are kind of steeped in the language can be let go of. Instead, an above-the-line, fully accountable, “if it is to be, it’s up to me” type of mind-set takes over. When that is in place, it’s a massive accelerant.', 'What does it mean to me and the legacy I want to leave? What’s my role in creating a trust-based environment versus not? To what extent do I operate below the line or out of blame or out of fear versus above the line, out of passion and opportunity and hope? It sounds super soft, but I’ll tell you: super heavy impact.', 'Simon London: Yeah. I mean, it’s adjacent to mind-sets. It’s almost like the ultimate existential mind-set that you bring to how you live and how you work.', 'Bill Schaninger: One hundred percent. If you think about what we’re asking of people, in the aspiration setting, we’re asking them to change what they might have done on their own, if it was just their own backyard, toward this aspiration for the whole entity. Then we’re asking them to ask if, not just assume that, they know why the people around them and their employees are behaving the way they are.', 'Then on this leadership part, we’re saying, “We’d like you to have the humility to acknowledge that, in some ways, you might not be good enough right now. Talk about it. Then have the courage to do something about it.” Huge unlock. But it is not by rote, and it’s not just a harder and faster version of yesterday’s plan.', 'Scott Keller: The first conversation we often have with CEOs is around this. “Do you have the humility, and do you have the courage, to pull this off?”', 'That conversation is always a robust and exciting one. Quite frankly, we’ve walked away from a few situations where it hasn’t felt like there’s a path there. Those two features at the senior levels in particular are critical.', 'Simon London: All right. Well, thank you for a fascinating and important conversation,Bill and Scott.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thank you.', 'Scott Keller: Thank you. Pleasure to be here.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you, our listeners, for tuning in to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

In recent episodes, the series has focused on insights from McKinsey Quarterly’s Bias Busters collection, which delves into how executives can harness insights from behavioral science to make better business decisions.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today, we’re revisiting the topic of cognitive bias—the wholly irrational but largely predictable patterns of thinking that get in the way of good decisions.', 'This episode is actually a “best of”—bringing you some highlights from our Inside the Strategy Room podcast series. If you like what you hear, please subscribe to that series.', 'Providing the insights are Tim Koller, a McKinsey partner, and Dan Lovallo, a former McKinsey consultant and professor of business strategy at the University of Sydney. Asking the questions is the host of the podcast series, Sean Brown.', 'To lead off, here’s Dan Lovallo talking about how to overcome the biases inherent in what’s known in behavioral science as “the inside view.”', 'Dan Lovallo: Quite a while ago, I think about 1993, Daniel Kahneman and I came up with the terms the “inside view” and the “outside view” to explain different modes of thinking. The inside view is the way people usually think about decisions—in other words, they start on the problem and they build the case. In business, the case often starts with an Excel spreadsheet. You start putting in numbers, and they look into a crystal ball and try to see the future and plan that future out in advance. That’s the natural way to think.', 'Another way to do it is to use lots of analogies or cases. When you use these cases, you take a more statistical view.', 'I can tell a story about the movie industry. I thought I was going to get rich—that’s the important part of this story. I did a study, along with Colin Camerer. What we were able to do was forecast movies out of the domestic box office based simply on a poster and a one- or two-line description on Metacritic. What we got were the similarity ratings between the focal movie we were trying to predict and a reference class.', 'The reference class was formed by genre, actors, and story line. That’s it. We took the intersection of those, and there were more than enough movies. When we added similarity ratings to the typical regression things they use like budget and whether it’s an action movie or not, our mean average residual error was 25 percent, which is exceedingly low for something like that based on the fact that all they needed was a poster and a paragraph about the movie.', 'The reason I thought I was going to get rich was because I got the meeting with the head of the studio, and I walked him through our data. I said, “What’s your error on average?” And he said, “One hundred percent. We think a movie is going to make $100 million, and it makes $50 million, or it makes $150 million. We’re just not close.” And I said, “Well, you know, I can cut that by 75 percent. Let’s work together.” And he thought for a while, and said, “No, I don’t think I can do it.” And I said, “Well, how many analogies do you use to make forecasts of movies at the beginning?” And he said, “Well, sometimes we use one.” In other words, they use almost all the inside view.', 'And I said, “What’s the most you’ve ever used?” And he said, “Two.” I said, “Well, do you believe what I’m doing? If you don’t believe me that we did this beforehand, give me your next slate of movies. If I’m helpful, you pay me, if not, it’s free.” I thought I can’t go wrong there. And he said, and this is where he was very honest, he said, “No, it’s not that. I get to pick 12 movies a year. And I’m only in this job for a few years. I don’t want evidence out there that I should’ve done something different.” Very candid. And there was no money for me.', 'Sean Brown: It seems that one of the key challenges is figuring out what those reference cases are. Are there any specific skill sets or techniques that help somebody who’s trying to take the outside view to do it effectively?', 'Dan Lovallo: It’s part art and part science. A way to think about it, for those who know how to do regressions—and I’m not going to assume everyone does—but they would be the main variables in your regression. In the case of movies, it’s genre, actors, story line, and things like that. You can do it with almost anything.', 'Tim Koller: A lot of it will depend on the industry. It’s not something you can pull from the financial statements. But if, for example, you’re in the chemical industry, first, you’ve done these things before yourself, and, second, it’s pretty easy to see what your peers have done, and what’s worked, and what hasn’t worked. Often these are big, visible projects. It’s a combination of past projects, with projects inside the company, plus knowledge of what your peers have done. There will be people who will know what’s happened in other companies and what their experiences were that you can bring into this as well.', 'Dan Lovallo: This is an important point. There are three types of learning that can go on. One, if you’re the decision maker, you learn from your own past experience. Two, you can learn from the past experience of the company or organization that you’re working for. And then the step that people rarely take is learning from others’ experience.', 'There’s an awful lot of information there. And I haven’t been presented with a problem where I couldn’t come up with a reference class.', 'Simon London: With the inside view vanquished, the team turns its attention to a bias known as anchoring. For example, during the annual budget process, the numbers for next year typically end up looking pretty much like this year’s numbers, plus or minus a few percent. How can companies overcome anchoring in order to reallocate capital more quickly and effectively? Again, leading us off is Dan Lovallo.', 'Dan Lovallo: Anchoring was something developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. It refers to the tendency to anchor on any number given. One of the best examples of it was people were asked to estimate Gandhi’s age at death. This may be imprecise, but one group was given an age of ten and another was given an age of 140. These are obviously completely ridiculous numbers, but they strongly affected the predicted age of death. If something that you know is ridiculous impacts your forecast, then imagine how much more salient last year’s budget is.', 'We call this endowed anchoring. You’re endowed with this anchor, which is what you did last year. You’re anchored to that in psychological ways.', 'Tim Koller: Another example that I think is interesting: we take a group of executives in a room and split them into two. We give one group a set of opportunities for different resource allocation for the coming year and what the payoffs would be. That’s all you give them. You give the second group exactly the same information, plus we give them the information about how the resources were allocated across units the prior year. What you’ll find is the answer is very different between the two groups because that second group automatically assumes this bias that maybe last year’s information was right. There is an innate push toward what happened last year, and that is a major problem that has to be overcome in organizations. Organizations typically start with last year and then move up or down incrementally. Rarely do they start from scratch and think, “What’s the best place to allocate our resources?”', 'Sean Brown: Clearly there’s an unconscious bias that’s going on with anchoring. But there might be other reasons why budgets don’t change year to year. I’d imagine it’s quite disruptive to reallocate people and capital dramatically on a year-to-year basis. How have you seen companies that have overcome the anchoring bias actually then overcome some of those other challenges associated with significant reallocation?', 'Tim Koller: I might challenge your premise about how difficult it is to do that. I think that’s often an excuse. It’s not that you’re going to change a lot every year across different business units. In other words, if one business unit is on the upswing and it needs more resources, that’s probably going to be the same for a couple of years, versus a business unit which is more mature. I don’t think it’s a good excuse to say it’s hard to do, because you need to do it at some point or another. And better to do it sooner rather than later.', 'With respect to projects, though, it is much easier because you typically have resources that you can move. For example, some of the oil companies will just do a forced ranking of all the different projects. Then they can pick the projects. Initially they do it mechanically and pick projects that have the highest returns. You might make some modifications later on, but that is a technique you can do for business units as well. You start out with something which is a forced ranking, which ignores history, and is entirely forward looking. Therefore, your starting point in the discussion is an allocation that is sometimes very different than what you did last year. You might modify it a little bit, but at least you’ve got a starting point that pushes you away from the anchor of last year.', 'Dan Lovallo: The only way to fight an anchor is with a new anchor. This is a little bit like how you form a reference class and a little bit like how you do a regression. You pick some of the biggest indicators. In other words, let’s say you’re a consumer-goods company, and you’ve got a store in Hong Kong. You might look at the growth of the entire sector, the growth in Hong Kong, and the growth of your product line. This is a quick-and-dirty thing. It doesn’t have to be fundamentally detailed. You take these attributes, and you run a quick regression model and predict what you think the sales would be in the Hong Kong store for this product line. And then you’re going to compare that to your inside view, which means focusing on your own plans and actions and last year’s budget, to set up a different anchor.', 'Tim Koller: The other thing you have to overcome is the internal dynamics or politics of the organization. For example, one technique people will use is to try to talk to everyone who’s going be in a meeting before the meeting to get them to buy in so there’s no debate at the meeting, and they get their point of view. Or people will go around the process directly to the CEO and say, “I really need those resources.” Because of this, you really have to be strict about the processes that you go through in order to overcome those internal dynamics that will work against the more fact-based objective reallocation. People’s prestige and their view of how they’re perceived in the organization are all at stake here. Often, they’re not looking at it from the perspective of the whole company. They’re going to try to move things back to where they had them. This is particularly true for those who have a lot of resources. You have to take specific steps to prevent that from happening.', 'Sean Brown: Tim, does that lend itself more to an annual budget process, or one where it happens more regularly? Is there a way to lower the stakes so there’s not as much pressure to try and save your resources?', 'Tim Koller: We did some research and found that when companies did their strategic planning at the beginning of the year, they put together a three- to five-year forecast. The first year of that forecast, ideally, should be the budget for the next year. But what we found was that when companies actually got around to budget time—let’s say they did they did the strategic plan in June, and the budget in October—the budget reverted back to the prior year’s allocation even though in their strategic plan they were going to have a big reallocation. One thing you can do is be more precise, or require that you don’t make changes from that three- to five-year plan to the next year’s budget through the process.', 'Another thing that you can do to give you more flexibility during the course of the year is to not allocate all of the resources and hold some back either for the CEO, or for the investment committee, or whatever body makes those decisions. That way when opportunities come along, you can allocate new resources.', 'The other thing you need to do is to make sure that even if you did allocate something to a project, if you’re not going to start spending the money until next September, when September comes around, you actually revisit and say, “Do we still want to spend it?” You might take money back. You might have a budget that is not set in stone. You can add pieces in some cases and take it away as you gain more information.', 'Simon London: Next, the team turns its attention to the infamous sunk-cost fallacy—the bias that leads us to continue with an activity based on the time and money we’ve already put into it, as opposed to taking a clear-eyed view of the prospects. As we’ll hear, the sunk-cost fallacy often gets in the way of decisions to close projects that should have been ended years ago, or indeed to divest perennially underperforming business units. Here’s Dan Lovallo to start the discussion.', 'Dan Lovallo: We did some research that looked at projects that were both unprofitable and cash needy. In other words, their sales growth couldn’t sustain the investment. You would think that somebody would kill them at some point. But the situation is those projects or business units had an 80 percent chance of surviving ten years.', 'This is really common. It’s about as common as you get. Part of the difficulty is there’s a lot of emotion tied to firing people. Naturally, people don’t want to do it. And so they don’t, and these things tend to keep living. If people don’t have processes in place, it’s very unlikely to happen.', 'Tim Koller: Some other research, as it applies to business units, for example, is that we found that companies often would not divest a business unit until a year or so after people had already started talking about it in the press.', 'The rule of thumb seems to be that it takes about two years after a company starts to have the conversation before they actually get around to doing anything about it. Or they come into the mode of, “Oh, we’ll fix this thing before we sell it,” which never happens, of course. You lose a lot of value over those two years by waiting. In addition to projects, divesting or pruning whole business units in the portfolio is also something that companies need to be better at in order to maximize the value creation.', 'Dan Lovallo: In the US economy, for stand-alone companies, that’s about 30 percent of the companies that have at least one business segment that’s not dying soon enough. And for multi-business-unit companies, that’s about 43 percent of the companies. It’s a ubiquitous problem.', 'Tim Koller: The reason they fall into this trap is typically because of the sunk-cost fallacy: “We’ve invested all this capital and time and energy into it, so let’s keep it going.”', 'We all know this does not make any sense at all. You need to have processes to eliminate that.', 'One approach is something that we sometimes call “stage gating.” Every time you want to spend more money on a project, at a certain phase of that project’s life to move onto the next phase, you have to go back and get permission to keep it going. There’s not the automatic presumption that once a project gets started, it will go to completion. The presumption is at certain milestones that are predefined ahead of time, you have to get permission to keep going with the project.', 'Dan Lovallo: And there’s a point in there: you have to define these milestones in advance, or else you’re going to get slippage and you’re going to fall into the sunk-cost fallacy. You have to have somebody who’s in charge who’s going to actually stop things if you don’t meet those milestones.', 'Sean Brown: One of your suggested remedies is something you call the burden of proof. Can you say more about that, Tim?', 'Tim Koller: The burden of proof is the idea that instead of making the case for divesting, you have to change it to, “Why should we keep this business?” Obviously, you can’t do it for the whole company every year, but one approach is, for 5 or 10 percent of the big projects or units every year, you ask that question, “Why should we hold onto this particular unit?” Or, “Why should we keep pursuing this particular project?” It’s a way of changing the sequence around so that if you can’t prove the case that you absolutely need to keep it, then the assumption is, “OK, we’re going to get rid of it.”', 'Sean Brown: In your article, you raised the notion of categorizing business investments.', 'Tim Koller: In this case, what you need to do is make sure that every unit or every investment is put into one of three or more categories.', 'There are those businesses or things that we want to accelerate. There are those that we want to maintain or defend. And then there are those that we need to dispose. And you force yourself to categorize each business into one of those so that, once again, if you can’t make the case for maintaining or accelerating a project or a business, then it automatically goes into the dispose category using some criteria that you don’t let the processes get in the way of.', 'Dan Lovallo: One thing that’s absolutely important is this won’t happen if it doesn’t come from the top. It simply won’t happen. The CEO has to make a call, and this has to be driven from the top.', 'Simon London: And finally in this episode, from value-destroying projects that refuse to die, to value-creating projects that don’t get the investment they need because they are not, well, very glamorous. What can executives use to ensure that the allure of “glamour” projects doesn’t get in the way of optimal resource allocation? Dan Lovallo starts this segment with a good example.', 'Dan Lovallo: My favorite example is when you’ve got a big oil field there are a number of things that have to be done. One of them is drilling new resources, oil, or gas. And that’s exciting. Now there’s another thing that has to be done in a big oil field, and that’s maintenance. You’ve got to maintain the wells. You’ve got to make sure that nothing untoward happens. That’s not so glamorous.', 'Frequently, those two necessary activities are completely separated. The way to go forward in the company is to be a great explorer, not so much a great maintenance person. That creates a problem and has created some issues that we all know about.', 'This kind of problem isn’t just limited to my favorite example in oil and gas. Tim can talk about how this generalizes to many more types of projects.', 'Tim Koller: When companies typically evaluate projects, like maintenance projects or the performance of a business unit, they typically make the assumption that if they don’t make an investment, then things will go along business as usual. Therefore, they end up with the assumption that a maintenance project has a zero present value. Or a business unit’s value is a steady-state kind of thing. The reality is that in many of these cases if you don’t make the right decisions and make the right investments, that project or that unit will decline in performance. But it’s often not acceptable to show a base case which is a decline. The base case is almost always a steady state. Therefore, the investments that keep it at a steady state don’t show up as creating any value. And that’s the source of a lot of the issue with respect to focusing on the new versus the maintenance of the old in some situations. That’s a mind-set that has to change.', 'Sean Brown: What are some of the tips and tricks that you would offer our listeners in terms of better valuing these maintenance approaches?', 'Tim Koller: One of the techniques is to make sure that different parts of the organization aren’t operating in silos. Decisions should be made where people who are doing maintenance things understand what’s going on with the faster-growing businesses and vice versa so people can understand what it’s all about.', 'Dan Lovallo: And one of the mechanisms from the oil and gas example earlier is really quite simple and I think somewhat ingenious: it’s the committees in most oil and gas companies. There’ll be an exploration committee and a maintenance committee, and different people oversee those. This leads to underinvestment in maintenance because there are more senior people on the exploration committee.', 'What one company did—and this company had a great safety record—was to have overlapping committee members. This allowed them to more easily balance out investments in maintenance and exploration.', 'The committee members that overlapped on the exploration committee but also sat on the maintenance committee could see the needs of maintenance and had an easier way to argue to the leader of the field and say, “Listen, they really need this money.” Overlapping committees are a way to get more information to the top in a more direct manner.', 'Tim Koller: Another is the CEO has to take the lead in saying, “We’re no longer going to accept the base case being business as usual.” There are base cases where the business or the project is declining or we’re going to destroy some value because we’re not spending enough money on maintenance, for example. It is essential to have that kind of mind-set built into the organization, where we’re always looking at, “What would really happen if we didn’t spend this money?”', 'Sean Brown: How do you tie this to the depreciation charges that companies are taking on their capital base?', 'Tim Koller: The depreciation is a crude metric, but sometimes it can be very useful. If your spending is less than the depreciation, you might want to be worried. If you’re spending much more but not growing, you want to be worried as well. It’s a starting point but it’s not sufficient. You really need to look at the business from the bottom up to make the right decisions. Once again, you don’t want to be anchored in the past. You want to be thinking about the future. The people who are closest to those assets will know what needs to get done or when something needs to get done. And you need to have a mechanism where you can hear their voices so that you can take that into consideration as you’re making your investment decisions.', 'Sean Brown: Any other suggestions for how executive teams can avoid this issue?', 'Dan Lovallo: One of the ways is to take personality out of the system. In one company, people are allowed to propose projects. The head of the business unit or division proposes the projects and puts them in writing. When the allocation decision is made, they’re not in the room. The CEO, the CFO, and the head of technology make the decision without anyone else. And you don’t get the head of the most glamorous division, or the head of the biggest division, or somebody who’s been there longest arguing for their project face-to-face. That makes a big push toward objectivity. I would recommend that to all companies.', 'Simon London: So there you have it.

Today we’ll be talking about energy—the world’s appetite for energy and the sources that feed it, from oil and gas to wind and solar from hydroelectric to hydrogen. It’s a big topic. The numbers involved are, of course, enormous, and so are the implications, not only for economics and industry structure but also for carbon emissions and climate. To talk through the facts and forecasts, I caught up in Amsterdam with McKinsey senior partners Namit Sharma and Christer Tryggestad. Namit and Christer, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for doing this.', 'Namit Sharma: Very happy to be here, Simon.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Thanks a lot for the invitation.', 'Simon London: So we’re going to be talking about global energy demand at the highest level, so where it goes from here. In my not-very-educated, layperson’s way, if you would ask me to guess, I would say energy demand probably tracks global GDP, plus or minus. Is that right?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Historically, that has been a correct observation. If you look at the last 100 years, we’ve seen energy demand grow around two to three percent per year, very much in line with global economic growth. Going forward, though, we see a delinking or decoupling of energy demand growth and economic growth.', 'While we see the economy continuing to grow at a fairly steady pace, we see energy demand decelerating quite significantly. For the next 15 years, maybe down to a bit less than a percent per year from two to three percent. And then from the mid-2030s we even see a flattening or a plateauing of energy demand.', 'Simon London: This is quite historically significant. Isn’t it? This is like an epochal moment.', 'Namit Sharma: I think it’s very significant. There are three or four things driving it. First, the shape of GDP is changing. Christer talked about the past 100 years, it was rapid initialization, first in the big Western economies, then China driving it in the early 2000s. Going forward we will see more services driving our GDP and economy. The energy that you need for services is inherently different or less than the energy used for the rapid initialization.', 'Second, and we all see it, we continue to get more efficient in how we use energy. We all have double-paned windows, so our heating is more efficient. We have appliances that continue to get more efficient. Our cars, including internal combustion engine or electric vehicles, they continue to get more efficient. That energy efficiency continues to drive down the overall demand for energy.', 'Another big trend is electrification. So not only do we get more efficient, everything is getting electrified, from road transport to people coming into the middle class and buying more appliances. Electricity is something that we think will grow twice the amount where it is today. That electricity is being powered by renewable sources.', 'All this together leads to a point where, yes, we will continue to grow our GDP; yes, the living standards will rise, but the energy that we will need will not track at the same growth rate. We will just need less energy. And at some point, I think around 2040, 2050, the energy demand will plateau.', 'Simon London: It will actually plateau? So we think global energy demand will actually reach a peak?', 'Namit Sharma: Yeah. By 2040, 2050.', 'Simon London: Wow. So, Christer, without getting too nerdy, just explain the research and what’s behind it. What do you mean by the reference case?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Behind a lot of the work we do on the Global Energy Perspective at McKinsey is what I call a “big energy demand model” where we model the demand for energy across segments. So it could be road transport, it could be industry, et cetera. We do that across the fuel types, so coal, gas, renewable, and we do that globally. We do it across 150 countries, regions across the world.', 'All that modeling is done bottom-up, where we look at the economics. It’s basically economics driven, whether you build a power plant or whether you buy a car, it’s driven by economic models on every single cell within that demand cube if you will. We don’t take into account regulation, except existing regulation, which is included with forecasted trends.', 'Simon London: But we can’t predict where regulation is going to go in future.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Exactly. What we’re doing then is to say that from the time when the regulation is not forecasted anymore, we have no subsidies, we have no incentives. It’s all based on fundamental economics.', 'Simon London: Namit mentioned electrification earlier. And the electrification of both industrial and consumer segments has been a big driver. Again, as a layperson, I’m thinking to myself, “Why does it matter whether I’m heating my home with electricity or natural gas? Why does it matter whether I’m powering my car with electricity, or gasoline? I’m still traveling the same number of miles.” Is there something inherent about electrification which reduces demand for energy?', 'Christer Tryggestad: There’s an inherent increased efficiency. Electrical engines are inherently more efficient than combustion engines. Absolutely. That is true. That’s also the main driver of why we see that while the demand for electricity doubles over the next 25, 35 years, the demand for other fuels is practically flat from today until 2050.', 'It’s the efficiency, as you say. It’s also this potential cleanness. If you take electricity and you make it from clean sources, you also get the lowering of the CO2 emissions, which is another driver along with efficiency.', 'Namit Sharma: If you think about how we have been using fuels, we have been burning or combusting them. Now burning or combustion inherently is an inefficient process. And again, I think it might not be true and you might be able to make it more efficient, but inherently it’s different when you’re actually generating energy through other sources than burning or combusting.', 'Simon London: It’s the combination of electrification with the rise of renewables. You put those two things together and it has quite a big, overall impact on how much energy needs to go into the system. That’s a great segue into renewables. Just talk a little bit more, Christer, about what’s going on. How fast are renewables growing, and why?', 'Christer Tryggestad: If you look at the past 20 years or so, renewables have grown from practically nothing, maybe 5, 6 percent of the installed capacity to now close to 50 percent of new installments. If you look forward, you will see a situation where two-thirds, or even more than that, of the power generated in the world is renewable by 2050.', 'Simon London: Oh, wow.', 'Christer Tryggestad: This has historically been driven by regulation, but right now and forward looking it’s driven by economics. For every single country and region we look at, the cheapest source of new power-generation capacity is a renewable source. It’s either solar or wind, depending a bit on the market.', 'It’s even more strong when you look at 2030, because then you’ll have the situation where it is cheaper to build new renewable generation capacity than it is to use the existing coal- or gas-based generation capacity. That’s an obvious turning point.', 'We used to say that the cost game is practically won by renewables. The discussion is no longer on the cost of the technology itself; it’s now becoming much more of a system-integration discussion. Because renewables are what we call intermittent—they produce power whenever the sun shines or when the wind blows. You need to make sure that you have power when you need it. That is the whole system-integration topic, where batteries or other flexible sources of power generation are needed to complement the renewables.', 'Simon London: I must say, again, it’s an eye-opener for me, and maybe I’ve just not been paying attention, but I think it will be an eye-opener for many people. Today in most countries, most regions of the world, renewables are the sensible, economic choice if you’re building new capacity. I wasn’t even aware of that.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Yes, and it’s been happening very fast. It’s no surprise. The cost line of renewables over the past five to ten years has been amazing. That’s the reason. This was not at all the case ten years ago.', 'Simon London: So just decompose renewables a little bit. What are we talking about, and what are the big winners here in terms of technologies?', 'Christer Tryggestad: The main growth technologies are solar power and wind power. Within wind it’s a two-hand segment. It’s onshore and offshore wind. Offshore wind is the newest and the fastest growth technology. It’s still a little bit more costly than the others, but catching up fast.', 'Namit Sharma: Part of it is that there’s a lot of investment that has gone into it. It started a little bit with Germany replacing nuclear and putting subsidies in solar. That was a big push for solar. The cost really came down because it was getting installed at scale. Wind has been also getting a lot of investments from a lot of companies. That just leads to stronger learning curves, stronger ecosystems or supply industry. And I think it just drives the overall cost down.', 'Simon London: Is there a role for hydrogen in all of this? I ask that question because we’re here in Amsterdam, and I took a ride in a Tesla from the airport, which was interesting, so electric. I was talking to my driver about whether he liked his electric car, which he did. But he was convinced that the automotive fuel of the future was hydrogen and gave me a long explanation as to why. Where does hydrogen stand in this?', 'Christer Tryggestad: My view is there’s a big role for hydrogen, but not necessarily in light-vehicle road transport. When it comes to light-vehicle passenger cars, the battery technology has already progressed so far, I think it’s hard for hydrogen to catch up.', 'Our analysis shows that around the mid-2030s, hydrogen will also be cost competitive. A big discussion is going to be around how you make that hydrogen. Currently you make it based on natural gas, so steam reforming on natural gas. What we see as renewables grow is you get more price volatility on the power side. You get more times with very low power prices.', 'Then there’s another way of making hydrogen, which is based on so-called electrolyzers, where you basically take water molecules and split it into hydrogen and oxygen, using power. That’s where I think hydrogen will come into play big time, connected to renewables. You actually already see it in some of the recent offshore-wind auctions; there is a link where you also add hydrogen to the solution.', 'Namit Sharma: For me, hydrogen is quite uncertain. Again, in terms of the technology that we’re talking about, whether it’s renewables or electrification, hydrogen is in a different bracket. I think hydrogen does need to de-risk itself. We still need to see a lot of money going into hydrogen. Doesn’t mean people are not playing.', 'Christer Tryggestad: I would make the distinction between the uses of hydrogen and how it is produced. Because already today there’s a lot of hydrogen being used in fertilizer production, for example. That hydrogen is being made from natural gas. The question is then, “Are there new uses for hydrogen, in addition to what we have today?” Then transport is the obvious question. That’s a big question where the jury is still out.', 'Simon London: Can I just ask you to recap the big numbers around renewables?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Currently renewables is around 25 percent of total power generation globally.', 'Simon London: Power generation is electricity generation, right?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Electricity generation globally. That includes hydro. Most of that 25 percent is probably hydro. So around 20 percent is hydro; the rest is solar and wind. If you look to 2050, around 75 percent of the electricity produced will be based on renewable sources. Hydro will remain at roughly 20 percentage points, but then you have more than half being solar and wind.', 'Simon London: It’s a big growth of solar and wind based on what we know today.', 'Christer Tryggestad: And that is produced power. If you look at the capacity installed, the numbers are even bigger because when you have a solar plant, the amount of capacity needed to produce the same amount of power for solar is higher than for many other sources of power generation.', 'Namit Sharma: The other important point is if you look at the new installations, we see very few new installations other than wind and solar. There are very few, if any, new gas plants built.', 'Simon London: If you look at what’s being built today, where people are pouring concrete and building plants, it’s wind and solar.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Maybe.', 'Simon London: Largely.', 'Christer Tryggestad: No. There are 200 coal plants being built in China. But I think the big shift that we’re seeing due to the competitiveness of solar and wind—and we’ll talk a little bit about the development year by year on our reference case—is that we expect a lot less coal built in that area than before. In the reference a year or a year and a half ago, we had almost a doubling of coal-based power-generation capacity in India. That number is a lot lower in the last reference scenario. The reason is that solar is getting so competitive that you’d rather build new solar and even add some battery storage instead of building new coal-based power generation.', 'Simon London: That underlines what a fluid situation it is. To some degree, because the economics are changing, national policies are changing, regulation is changing, the reference case, again, is our best guess based on some serious modeling, but it’s going to move. What does all of this mean for oil? And when will we hit peak oil production? What’s our latest thinking?', 'Namit Sharma: So peak oil demand—we’re probably at more oil than we need. Let’s talk about the big sectors of oil. Road transport is a big sector for oil. We need less oil for road transport, given the EV [electric-vehicle] uprising. Chemicals is also a big growth sector for oil, with plastics and all that stuff, that segment continues to grow. We will need more oil for chemicals. I think there’s an increasing realization, mainly in Middle East, to stop using oil for power generation. That might sound strange, but Middle East was still using a lot of oil for power generation.', 'Pluses and minuses overall, we see in our reference case, over the next ten, 15 years, oil still grows by ten million barrels a day. For anchor today, we use around 100 million barrels a day, so over the next 15 years, ten years we get 10 percent growth for oil. In our reference case, apparently, that’s when it peaks. After that we see a decline in overall demand for oil.', 'Simon London: And that peak comes roughly when?', 'Namit Sharma: Around 2033. But I have to be careful. We can talk about stories here, but I think four years ago we were putting oil demand peak as a sensitivity in our models.', 'Christer Tryggestad: It was not part of the reference.', 'Namit Sharma: Right. It was not part of the reference case. Before last year oil was peaking in 2047. Now we are saying oil peaks in 2033. If you actually, and given this reference case, as Christer said, we talked to all our global experts to understand what’s going on and in some ways we have to build some sort of consensus. We also did an accelerated case. If you look at a couple of tipping points, like the EV uptick in China in 2020, if you look at the policy targets from the government and the OEM targets that are coming up, if you look at the regulations on plastics, we could actually see a further decrease in oil demand, especially in road transport, especially in chemicals, and you actually can see a peak in oil demand over the next decade.', 'Now, what does it mean? In the end, you could also say it means that instead of growing at 1 percent it will probably grow at zero percent or a bit negative. But you have to understand it’s a commodity that declines every year by 3 to 5 percent. We will continue to need oil, even if the oil demand peaks. However, it will be a new concept, and we have to see how the geopolitical producer landscape aligns itself to this new reality whenever it becomes very clear.', 'Christer Tryggestad: In many ways, you can say that the question of when oil peaks is less important than the question of what happens afterwards. In the reference case you could almost say that oil plateaus. There is a decline rate of 0.5 percent or something a year until 2050. But it’s relatively little compared to the 3 to 5 percent natural depletion of the oil fields.', 'In the accelerated scenario, in the sensitivity, we see a much steeper decline after the peak. The peak comes earlier, next decade, and the decline is steeper, two and a half percent per year. That means that you get a lot closer to the natural depletion rate and probably it will have a much bigger impact on the dynamics on the industry than if you had the reference scenario.', 'Simon London: You mentioned industry dynamics there. And, of course, a lot of the same companies that are big in gas are big in oil, so just compare the outlook for oil. What’s the outlook for gas?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Gas, our analysis shows, is inherently more resilient than oil. And you can say that there are three main reasons why this is so. First, in many places gas is replacing a dirtier fuel, coal. A big driver, in many cases, of energy transition, is the climate. That is a positive. The other positive driving the resilience of gas is that even in a system where you have a lot of renewables, so you have the renewable transition, you need flexibility in the system, as I talked about. That is naturally provided by natural gas.', 'Simon London: And this is the baseload concept. You’ve got your renewables, but they tend to be quite volatile in what they’re producing and when, so you still need this baseload and gas provides that.', 'Christer Tryggestad: So in the evenings in a place where solar energy is important, you need something else too. In the Netherlands, for example.', 'The third reason is that gas is, to a large extent, used in what we call hard-to-abate sectors. You use a lot of gas in the industry for medium and high-temperature heat. That is one of the sectors that is hardest to abate or to replace.', 'Simon London: What’s an example of that?', 'Christer Tryggestad: Metals products is a typical example where you need high, high temperature.', 'Simon London: So if you’re smelting something?', 'Christer Tryggestad: You burn the gas to get the heat. And to electrify that is quite tricky. That’s the reason why inherently, gas is more robust than oil demand. Even though for gas we see a peak or a Peak energy, peak oil, and the rise of renewables: An executive’s guide to the global energy system 7 plateauing towards the end of the period in the latest reference case.', 'Simon London: Which is 2050?', 'Christer Tryggestad: In the 2040s, we see gas peaking. Actually in the mid-2030s we see gas peaking. But it’s really plateauing, not declining sharply. There is one big black swan here on gas, and that is hydrogen. And it’s electrolyzer-based hydrogen. Because the alternative for natural gas in many of the hard-to-abate segments or sectors would be to use hydrogen based on electrolyzers. There’s a lot of scaling discussions and different discussions around that, but that, for me, would be the one black swan.', 'Simon London: So it’s possible that we could get this substitution of hydrogen for gas and some of these industrial applications. And that could change the picture.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Exactly. We could get the substitution of hydrogen for gas in some models, and, where we use the hydrogen based on gas, we could get a substitution to hydrogen based on electrolyzers.', 'Simon London: And then what about coal? It tends to be the most greenhouse-gas-emitting fuel source. What’s the future of coal in all of this?', 'Namit Sharma: Coal is an interesting story. But I think one thing is pretty clear: coal is going to decline massively, for the reasons that you pointed out. In our analysis we see coal demand going down 40 to 50 percent from current levels over the coming two to three decades.', 'However, it will still remain in the system. And I think, as Christer mentioned before, there are still some coal plants planned to be built in Asia. Over time as our power systems develop based on renewable technologies, you might see further phasing out of coal.', 'Christer Tryggestad: When we say that there’s a 40 percent decline, that’s almost exclusively driven by China. And many other places it’s flat or some places even a slight decline in the coal demand.', 'Simon London: So China is moving aggressively to phase out coal, but because it’s such a big part of the energy system in China that does not happen overnight. That’s for sure.', 'Namit Sharma: Indeed.', 'Simon London: That’s a big takeaway for me from all of this research is despite these very big moves going on, on a number of areas, and this is an apt metaphor, but it is like turning the supertanker. The global energy system is like a supertanker in that it’s got this momentum; there’s a huge amount of sunk capacity and infrastructure and industry structure around it. That does not change overnight. And you’re talking decades, not years, to look at these trends.', 'Namit Sharma: Indeed. It’s a complex system, so you also need to be careful because not all fuels are easily replaceable. That’s why when we talk about the implications, we do need to take into account that indeed there are some sectors where the growth is, but you will continue to need some other fossil fuels where economic rent can still be made.', 'Simon London: Right. Let’s segue from there into greenhouse gas emissions [GHG]. Based on the modeling that we’ve got, what are the implications for GHG emissions and where are we? People tend to use the Paris scenarios.', 'Namit Sharma: I think there’s good news and bad news. The good news is, based on all of the stuff we have talked about, the carbon emissions will decline. I think they’ll be 20 percent lower by 2050 than where we are today. And that’s in the reference case. However, I think the bad news is that they still remain far away from the two-degree pathway laid out in the 2016 Paris Agreement. Even in an accelerated scenario, we don’t see achieving this two-degree scenario laid out in the Paris Agreement.', 'Christer Tryggestad: This is one of the challenges we receive on the reference case. It goes something like this. If you believe that climate change is for real, and most people do believe that climate change is real, does it then make sense to have a reference case that fails to reach the two-degree scenario and even more the 1.5 degree scenario to such a big extent?', 'Simon London: Because the argument being that if we are overshooting that pathway, there will be regulatory action.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Exactly. I think the only answer to that is to say that we want to develop, call it the economic, or the financially driven, reference case, and then we are happy to do analysis around that and figure out what will it actually take to get the two-degree or even the 1.5 degree scenario.', 'Simon London: I know you both work with big oil companies, big utilities. Maybe let’s start with oil and gas companies. When you have C-suite conversations, I’m guessing they have digested a lot of this. This is their business. What’s their response? How are they responding to this?', 'Namit Sharma: I think it’s good to understand that companies are nuanced. You have the super, big global players. You have smaller regional players. And you have national oil companies. And, again, I think the conversation is nuanced across these players. But I think there are two dimensions to look at.', 'The first one, as we talked about, the good news for them is we will continue to need oil. If for nothing else, as we decline 3 to 5 percent every year, to put some numbers against it, this means that we need to find 43 million barrels per day of oil, new oil, in 2035. So there’s still a lot of oil to be found and produced. Of course, as some of this transition takes shape, as some of the oil demand goes down, we got a peak in the demand, we need to ensure these barrels are resilient in the price environment that you might get into. That’s the first question on the current portfolio. We have to find oil but it needs to be resilient barrels on the cost curve.', 'There’s a second dimension to the question where power is a growing segment. In some ways it’s the new business. So why would we not look at it? And I think they can look at it, but they also want to be very sharp on their investment thesis. Are the returns the same as my core business? Is the risk the same as my core business? I go down deep in the ocean, drill something versus setting up a windmill on land? It’s a different risk, different return.', 'The other thing is the way you look at opportunities is different. It’s very local. It’s very specific opportunities all across the world. And you need, in some ways, more downstream commercial marketing capability, especially on the retail side. And I think some of them are evaluating options on what this business can mean for them. It’s at least those two dimensions that my oil and gas clients are thinking about.', 'Simon London: And what about utilities? Because this is also a big change for utilities as well, the rise in renewables. You mentioned earlier, Christer, the challenge of integrating renewables into the existing power system. What’s the discussion?', 'Christer Tryggestad: To some extent it’s relatively similar to the oil companies. First, you will expect that because of electrification, it’s a positive story because you will have increased demand for power. And that is true. On the demand side, the story’s probably much more positive than for the oil and gas companies. However, it’s a pretty big shift going from traditional, large, centralized power generation based on coal, gas, hydro, nuclear towards more renewables like wind/solar type of generation. Higher upfront capex [capital expenditures], less opex [operational expenditures]. Often smaller margins. So it’s also quite a big change also for utilities. And you also get new competitors coming, like the oil companies, like the oil majors that are gigantic companies with big financial muscles.', 'You also see more light-footed renewable specialists, like solar developers. So you face a completely new competitive environment where I also see many of the traditional utilities trying to find their way and find a new competitive model for them to survive and prosper.', 'Simon London: So, again, the industry dynamics are changing, and that will raise the question again of competencies, like what actually are we good at?', 'Namit Sharma: The good thing for utilities, and Christer, you might agree, but it’s actually pretty simple. They need to figure out how to win in their current business, which is changing but they don’t have the choice like the other companies.', 'Simon London: Power is not going away. Far from it.', 'Namit Sharma: No. And they’re not getting into oil and gas. So in some ways the question is simple.', 'The answer, of course, is very complex given all the complexities that you mentioned.', 'Simon London: So I think that’s all we have time for today. But Christer and Namit, thank you so much for joining.', 'Christer Tryggestad: Thank you, Simon. It was a pleasure.', 'Namit Sharma: Thank you.', 'Simon London: Great.

63,The value of talent management,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/value-of-talent-management,The roles that create the most value in your organization may not be at the top.,"['The roles that create the most value in your organization may not be at the top.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London discusses the value of talent management in business and how getting the right people in these critical seats can turbocharge performance.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Our topic today sounds beguilingly simple: getting the right people into the critical roles that drive value for your company—in other words, matching talent to value. The snag is, many companies don’t have a really crisp perspective on how value is going to be created, let alone the roles that will be critical to making it happen. Even if they know the roles, they may not have taken a really dispassionate look at whether the people in the roles today have the skills and support they need to get the job done. To discuss the discipline of talent to value, I caught up with McKinsey partners Carla Arellano and Mike Barriere. Prior to joining McKinsey, Mike was chief talent officer at Walmart and, before that, head of HR at Alcoa. Carla and Mike, thanks so much for doing this, and welcome to the podcast.', 'Carla Arellano: Thanks, Simon. Really excited to be here.', 'Mike Barriere: Great to be talking to you today, Simon, thanks.', 'Simon London: What about this issue of mapping talent to value? What does it mean in practice?', 'Carla Arellano: Talent to value flips many of the usual approaches to talent decisions on their head. When I say usual approaches, I say that most decisions and energy around talent are hierarchically driven. They tend to be driven by gut instinct and judgment, by the sense that somebody’s been at the organization for a while and has achieved X, Y, or Z level.', 'Talent to value flips all of that around and says, let’s start with how you’re going to create value in the organization. Then let’s figure out what’s the work that needs to happen to get there. Then let’s figure out who needs to deliver that work. And finally, who are the people that we would put in those roles to deliver that work?', 'Mike Barriere: Carla, I love those points, and it’s almost as if current state or where HR is coming from, it’s fuzzy logic. It’s a bit fuzzy about the roles and what’s required. It’s a bit fuzzy about the talent. It’s who are the usual suspects? Who are the favorites? Because a lot of that’s being identified with more subjective processes.', 'While the goal isn’t that different: get the best talent in the most critical roles, it’s how we do it that’s fundamentally different, and it has to be. So how do you determine which roles are most critical? And is there some science you can apply? Like, when you think about value drivers and modeling, where do those drivers show up? Therefore, if you think about the roles that are going to contribute on the front end, you have more of a fact base in terms of why certain roles are more critical than others.', 'And it’s because they have a disproportionate contribution to the value you’re trying to create. On the other side of it, if you’re not clear about what is success in the role, and whether we know our talent well enough to put the best in the role, you’re also not clear.', 'So you’re making decisions without knowing which roles are critical and which talent is really the best fit. But what we’re saying is that you’re putting the company and the future value in jeopardy by not doing this.', 'Simon London: And it all starts with the value agenda: How are we going to make money? How are we going to create value over the next X years? And then what are the critical roles to delivering? And by the way, those critical roles may not be the most senior roles in the org.', 'Mike Barriere: And the talent that’s best fit for them may not be currently on your radar. You have to find them.', 'Simon London: When we do this analysis with companies, and we help them map the critical roles to deliver value, how many roles, percentage-wise, do we typically find we’re talking about?', 'Carla Arellano: We’ve recently run some neat research across the 50 or 60-plus efforts that we’ve achieved recently. We’re finding some very strong similarities across these. Usually, there are between 30 and 50 roles that make up somewhere between 70 percent and 80 percent of the value agenda. That tends to be regardless of company size, in terms of market cap and employee number.', 'More interestingly, we’ve also found that it’s usually about 15 roles that are delivering somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent of the value. So there tends to be quite a bit of concentration in value.', 'Sometimes what happens, as Mike described, is roles have been built around super humans or super roles. Those roles are picking up a lot of value, potentially disproportionately from where you’d like them to be. If you think about the implications for a CEO or a leadership team, you don’t necessarily need to spread all your efforts and keep track of several hundred people.', 'Mike Barriere: I’m amazed at how many times, having gone through this, we see the beauty when you take a value driver, you know the value, you know what functions contribute. Assigning value to roles is really important in this work, and so it could actually start growing. And then you start to go down the list, and by the time you get to 50 roles, you’ve captured more than 80 percent of the value.', 'And again, I cringe a little about what’s the percentage. Is it 2 percent or 5 percent or 1 percent—it’s more about, what can a CEO in particular do, though we like to think of the G3, the CEO, CFO, CHRO [chief HR officer], as the body in the organization that does this work—but this becomes an active list that you manage. I find that it’s hard to manage more than a line of sight that’s 50 roles deep in the organization. If those 50 roles are capturing 80 percent of the value, it’s important to prioritize and actively manage them.', 'But the other part of this and the work that we’ve been getting into lately is there’s no reason why you can’t take this down into levels in the organization. The fact that there’s a G3 at the top, that’s the enterprise view, and that’s where you look at 50 roles. Let’s say you’re a function or a business-unit leader; you might have five of those 50 in your area, but you might also have another ten that you really care about. You start to cascade the method down. You want every business leader to be thinking this way and thinking about what is the value we’re creating in the function. But we start at the top in terms of getting alignment, particularly through the CEO, CFO, and CHRO, to take the hard look, and where do those 50 show up?', 'Simon London: Can I just push a bit on this notion of assigning value to roles? Particularly roles that are not in the commercial front line? If I think about big, functional roles, something like cybersecurity. Those roles are absolutely critical. If good people are not in those roles, the enterprise could grind to a halt. How do you assign value to roles like that?   Carla Arellano: A core part of this starts by getting underneath what work needs to happen, and what needs to be done to create that value. Then we go into who needs to contribute to that value. Who needs to do that work to get there?', 'We have a series of heuristics across what we’ve called value creators. To your example, commercial leaders tend to be the most straightforward, or P&L [profits and losses] owners. Value enablers. So think of this as your enabling functions, HR, IT, et cetera. And then what we call value protectors. This is where your cybersecurity, legal, et cetera would come in. As we go through each value pool, we’re trying to get underneath what’s the work, who’s doing it, and how are they driving it?', 'We’re really testing for, where is the hard-core work and strategic decision making and leadership happening? In the cybersecurity example, one of the things that we look for frequently and have discussions about is, how much value is at risk? And how much do we want to assign in terms of protecting risk? That’s where cybersecurity roles come in rather frequently.', 'Mike Barriere: One thing I would emphasize is the front end of this. When you think of value drivers, let’s say you think of some that might be around organic growth, let’s say revenue growth as an example. You start to look across the organization. Let’s say you want to grow a billion dollars on the top line. You look at your commercial groups, sales, and marketing. You look at product or operations, depending on your business, and then you look at those enabling functions.', 'You could literally take a billion dollars of top-line revenue growth and say, OK, 30 percent of that has to come from sales and marketing. They have to go out and create the demand. But obviously, that’s not all of it. We have to deliver the product. Maybe there’s an R&D contribution, or maybe there’s a real operations component. These are the creator roles, because they’re so important to generate the demand for, in this case, the top-line revenue growth, as well as the delivery.', 'So maybe 30 percent is in sales and marketing, another 30 percent in operations. Now you still have 40 percent of that value, which could come from these enabling functions like technology or HR to provide the talent to the sales teams or the operations teams. You start to build this mapping—and we have a great way to model this—of the value driver. What functions are contributing what percentage of that value? Then that’s where you get into the valuation of the role.', 'Let’s say you take 30 percent of a billion [dollars] into sales and marketing, there’s a value there, and you say, OK, well, there’s seven roles in marketing that are absolutely essential to grow top-line revenue. They’re those key account managers that we’ve been using as an example. You then distribute that value across those roles. There are some heuristics that we work with, some percentages, whether you’re a creator or enabler type of role. But the beauty of putting this into a model is that then you can do sensitivity analysis. So maybe it’s 60 percent on the front end and only 20 percent on the product side, or vice versa. You can quickly see the impact on the kind of roles that pop up.', 'Simon London: So we’ve had a robust conversation as a management team about what our value agenda is. We’ve hammered out some areas of ambiguity. We’ve done the hard work of then identifying the roles that are really going to matter over the next few years. What happens next?', 'Mike Barriere: The fun stuff. First is, if these are the roles, what does success look like? I come from HR, so I can pick on myself. Usually, HR doesn’t have up-to-date, nimble, and dynamic role descriptions that capture what a role needs to do today.', 'This is part of the issue, Simon, where a lot of our HR processes are dated and not designed for this period of exponential change and disruption. The first thing, when you say this is a critical role, we all agree it’s one of the top 50, is to define, and Carla mentioned it, a role card.', 'A role card consists of the mission for the job, and then in language of jobs to be done, what are the five to seven things that are most important that this role has to accomplish to be successful? You also know the value that the role should capture. It should be written in a language that’s clear, concise, and tied to those value drivers that we talked about.', 'Some roles might hit two or three or even four value drivers, and you want to be clear that this is exactly what needs to be done in the role to capture that. That’s half the role card. The other half is, how are you going to assess somebody against those requirements?', 'Role descriptions were designed to stand the test of time. A lot of them are old, static, they’ve been around. Compensation teams use them to price jobs relative to market. Search firms use them.', 'We’re talking about something different. We need a much more nimble, concise way to think about jobs and design jobs, so you don’t get this phenomenon of double-, triple-hatting somebody, or having them do 60 percent non–value-add work.', 'We want to be really crisp, and that’s why we even changed the language to role card, not a job description, because you want to be clear about, this is what this role needs to do over, like, a three-year time horizon, and this is the value that you can measure success in the role against.', 'Simon London: It’s a hybrid between a role description and your annual objectives, somewhere in the middle there. It’s a different critter.', 'Carla Arellano: Yes, very much so. When we’ve developed these baseball cards or role cards for leaders, one of the first things that happens is the reaction that, oh, we have the person in this role doing 50 other things that are not on that list, usually followed by, how would we expect them to actually deliver this, when we have them doing all these other things. And are they best placed for everything else?', 'The other thing, where Mike was going with this notion of the knowledge, skills, attributes, and experiences, is that most organizations have moved people into roles based on the fact that they were successful in this other role, or somebody likes them and knows them, and they’ve worked well together for a very long time.', 'But the focus should instead be on, do we want somebody who can build a team of very diverse profiles to go do something different or hard? Or do we want somebody who can be a strategic negotiator with customers? Those are very different requirements for a role. Getting specific on those and how you might measure it can be hard. But the rewards are very high.', 'Mike Barriere: Now we’re going into the third step, which is the matching. We defined the value agenda, the drivers, we know where the critical roles are in the organization, we write the role cards, and now it’s time to assess and match the talent.', 'A lot of times you’ll find that you don’t have your best talent in a good percentage of the critical roles and your best talent is somewhere else and not even on the radar for these kind of roles. That’s why the matching is really important.', 'Simon London: What’s the percentage of mismatch? When you do this for the first time, do you find that organizations are 70 percent mismatched? Or in most organizations is it more like 10 percent of the roles cause some serious head-scratching and conversations once these cards are laid out?', 'Mike Barriere: What comes to mind is a recent experience where we found 45 percent of the roles were a great match. The incumbent was the best fit. Twenty percent to 30 percent typically have gaps, but they’re addressable. They do have some gaps, but they are the best talent you have, and if you have clarity about how to help them address their gaps—which we can get to in a minute, the techniques for that—typically, it could be in the ballpark of 20 to 30 percent that are mismatched. It doesn’t mean you fire them. It means that there’s probably a better role for them, or you’ve got to look either internally or maybe go external.', 'These are not the roles you want to give somebody a stretch assignment for. These are your critical roles that are going to deliver value, so you really want to put your best players in these roles.', 'Carla Arellano: I think the other thing alongside that, Simon, that I’ve seen frequently is looking at the team around a role or looking at the team of roles. Because you might find that there’s a gap of an incumbent to a role. You might also find that across a team, there’s a core missing experience or capability set that you need to complement in some way.', 'I have an organization that’s been going through a restructuring for quite a while. None of the individuals in critical roles had actual restructuring experience, which was a little bit of a flag. It wasn’t that every single one of those roles needed to have it, but it was important that at least one or two of them did to get there. There’s that individual view, and then there’s a little bit of a team view as well.', 'Simon London: This goes back to my slight skepticism about how easy it is to assign value to roles, because I think we’re acknowledging that so much of what goes on in an organization is a matter of team production. There are teams delivering value, not individuals.', 'If you say you need to reinforce a role by bringing in somebody else as a wingman—it’s a gendered phrase—but a wingman effectively who compensates for one element. Aren’t you immediately beginning to undermine this idea that it’s that role and that role alone that’s delivering the value?', 'Mike Barriere: No, I have a very strong view on that. A critical role leader needs to absolutely leverage the team—and it might not even be their own team. There could be an important collaboration across function or function to a business unit or across a business unit.', 'Now we’re getting into, how do you optimize value capture for that critical role leader? They’re on the hook. You need somebody responsible. If you just try to tackle it from the team dynamic, you’re going to miss something. We like to think that there’s a critical role leader that’s on the hook, but part of their success is going to be driven by how well they build the team around them and how well they can build cross-functionally or collaborate horizontally in the organization. It doesn’t put teams aside and say it’s only the role that’s important. To be successful in the role, team competency is absolutely essential.', 'Simon London: Ultimately somebody has to be on the hook, though. I think that’s the message. Somebody has to own the delivery of that value.', 'Mike Barriere: Exactly, because that happens a lot. You take a team approach or you do something broad strokes without really having that person who you look at and say, that’s their role, the value is tied to them in that role. But the way they succeed involves not only the team, it involves the workforce. And does the workforce have the capabilities? What about the culture, how they run the place. Do they take out organizational bureaucracy, so they can move with speed and agility? A lot of the organizational things light up here, but this is the front end to prioritize the role. Then how do you make a leader successful in that role vis-à-vis the top team and the organization and the capabilities and the culture to run the place?', 'Simon London: Do you get pushback from organizations at that cultural level? That doing this in this way just feels kind of countercultural?', 'Carla Arellano: Definitely. Maybe more than pushback, there tends to be a very deep-seated philosophical question for organizations. One, about what’s the difference between critical and important, and how do we make sure that we’re not creating a stratification of our workforce and making some people feel more important than others?', 'A lot of organizations—this is going to sound a little bit harsh—confuse fairness with, everybody has to get everything the same no matter what. They end up struggling to feel comfortable doing the approach, and then figuring out what they would do differently for that group of critical roles than they might do for other roles in the organization.', 'There’s also this sense of what’s the urgency? And where Mike was going about the culture and the agility that you create in an organization, to make sure that those critical roles are able to be successful and deliver on the value. That likely will require a shift from the way things are normally done to drive forward a different sense of urgency than you might have had in terms of certain things.', 'Mike Barriere: I have two principles related to this, Carla. It’s that development matters for everybody. Every employee in an organization should have the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, and you want to provide that, especially as leaders.', 'While that’s important, it’s also important to think about the future of the company. Therefore, who are those talents that you absolutely want to get into the most critical roles? You need to do both, but many times, we only do the broader set. Because there’s a culture that it’s one team, rather than there being a specific set of certain people. That’s why we really put the emphasis on the roles that matter, and then not only looking for the 50 people, but what’s the succession pipeline behind them?', 'There could be a couple hundred people that you’re also developing to be ready to take those roles in the future.', 'Simon London: It’s true, every organization treats people differently. It’s just that we’re used to doing it based on hierarchy. The difference here is, we’re focusing on value first and role first, and that can feel a little unusual. But it’s not like everybody in an organization gets the same treatment today anyway. Hierarchy takes care of that.', 'Mike Barriere: I’d add that it is hierarchy, but it’s also the definition of top talent, or when you use the nine box to try to find out who are our highest potentials. Companies segment already, but they segment the talent, not the roles. Then you need more of a fact base of who has the potential? And potential for what?', 'We’re saying it’s potential to be successful in critical roles. To leverage the fact that most companies are already segmenting talent, we’re saying, segment the roles first, and then match the talent and get that right, and then broaden it. Broaden development and leadership and opportunity and tackle it that way.', 'Simon London: If you think about what a CHRO needs and what a good HR function needs in a company that’s going to do all this well, what are the gaps that we often see?', 'Mike Barriere: The first part is guts. The CHRO has to have the moxie to push up against the CEO and the CFO, the exec team, and call out if the value agenda is not clear. If it’s ambiguous or fluffy or ownership is not quite there, this is the moment that a CHRO can really say, “Hey, if we want to leverage our human assets, we need much more clarity about drivers and where in the organization is the most critical, because we want to deploy our talent just like you would think about deploying the financial capital.” The role of the CHRO, particularly with the G3, is to increase awareness and to lead. We need to take our value agenda and our value drivers into the organization.', 'From there, the CHRO does need a good sense of the business and the industry and what are the trends. To Carla’s point, the CHRO is an officer first, and you happen to have an HR talent tool kit, but the role is about understanding the business, the business dynamics, the ways that the company can achieve value in the future.', 'Carla Arellano: Mike, one of the things that you said really jumps out at me. CHROs are probably most comfortable, but I think if you get into some of their teams, there tends to be less comfort. And it’s this concept of really knowing the business and the industry and how it makes money.', 'What I tend to find is, it might be that an HR leader understands it but might feel uncomfortable engaging a business leader on where value is going to come from, and why they think they’re going to achieve a certain margin, or what is the plan to capture that digital growth?', 'There’s something about what you said earlier on, having the moxie but also enabling that in your team and giving them the comfort level that they have just as much right, as well as the demand on them to really understand what needs to happen and by whom, so that they can engage productively.', 'Simon London: So, I think we’re out of time for today. Carla and Mike, thank you so much for doing this.', 'Carla Arellano: Thank you, Simon, it was a pleasure.', 'Mike Barriere: Simon, thanks.', 'Simon London: And thank you as always, to our listeners, for tuning into this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

64,Unlocking growth with data-driven marketing and creativity,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/data-driven-marketing,"Marketing has been on the front lines of the digital revolution, but the landscape has become much more complicated, requiring a focus on growth, data, and new modes of creativity.","['Marketing has been on the front lines of the digital revolution, but the landscape has become much more complicated, requiring a focus on growth, data, and new modes of creativity.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior expert Biljana Cvetanovski and partner Jason Heller about new and powerful data-driven marketing strategies—and the role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) as the architect of a company’s growth engine.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be talking about marketing: a discipline that, in many ways, has been in the front lines of the digital revolution. Once upon a time, marketing was mostly about brand management and advertising. Now it has become a lot more complicated, and so has the role of the CMO.', 'As we’ll hear, the scope of the role has increased enormously: from being a steward of the brand to, these days, being an architect of growth. So what does the successful marketing organization look like? And what skills do CMOs need to deliver against this challenging growth mandate? To find out, I spoke with McKinsey partner Jason Heller and senior expert Biljana Cvetanovski. Later this month, Jason and Biljana will be presenting their latest research at the annual Cannes Lions Festival. In this conversation, they give us something of a sneak peek. So Jason and Biljana, welcome to the podcast, and thanks in advance for doing this.', 'Jason Heller: Thanks, Simon. Exciting topic.', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: Thank you, Simon. Good to be here.', 'Simon London: So we’re going to be talking about the past, present, and future of marketing—big topic. For those of us who don’t work in marketing, Jason, could you just start by stepping back and telling us what has changed over the last five to ten years? How has the day-to-day job of a marketer evolved?', 'Jason Heller: Marketing has been transforming for well over a decade—probably into two decades at this point. That said, the last five years or so really have seen this monumental shift in several areas. First, there’s never been as much data available for better targeting, segmentation, personalization, and analytics. The increased use of first-party data, the growing privacy regulations around it, new approaches to data governance: these are all part of the day in the life of a modern marketer and modern CMO, which was not true five to ten years ago—certainly not ten years ago.', 'The analytical horsepower required to mine through that data and create actionable insights to unlock new opportunities: it’s within reach for everybody. That used to be the heavy lift. It used to be a really bold aspiration to think that you could have such a rich, data-driven marketing practice. Now that’s even available to the small- and midsize marketers.', 'Two years ago, we crossed a tipping point where digital-media spend outpaced TV-media spend. That’s not true for every marketer. But it’s interesting when you think about digital becoming the primary investment area for media—and this is driven largely by mobile, by the way. The capabilities, and the measurement, and everything that comes along with that need to change within the marketing organization.', 'With all that being said, consumer loyalty is on the decline. Competitors are even closer. They’re one click away from your customers. And so there’s a lot of disruption that marketers have to deal with. Marketers and agencies are struggling to keep up with that pace of change. That degree of change—and the response and structure around the response to the change—is probably the biggest thing that’s happened in the last few years.', 'The increased use of first-party data, the growing privacy regulations around it, new approaches to data governance: these are all part of the day in the life of a modern marketer.', 'Simon London: So that is, indeed, a lot of change: more data, more digital, more mobile, more opportunity, but less loyalty. So, Biljana, you pick up the thread from here. What does that mean for the role of the CMO?', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: It has always been part of the CMO role remit to drive growth. But I think it’s becoming much more of an explicit capability that they’re accountable to deliver. There’s been a movement from the CMO taking on a more classical role—which may be around advertising, brand stewardship, maybe even customer experience—and leapfrogging elsewhere.', 'And, increasingly, what we’re seeing is that CMOs are not only responsible for delivering on the growth agenda, but they’re also more and more accountable for designing and defining what it is that the rest of the organization is moving toward. It’s actually a very natural place for the CMO to be. They have access to many approaches to deliver on that growth agenda. That could be everything from building brands to growing loyalty to improving the end-to-end customer experience. What we’re finding is that, ultimately, the CMO is being judged on how well they can grow the business.', 'Simon London: So that’s very clear. But just make sure I understand the connection between the context that Jason just described and this new growth mandate for the CMO. What’s the connection between the two? What are the cause and the effect?', 'Jason Heller: Five to ten years ago, the thought of a CMO owning the end-to-end customer experience, even just the understanding of what an end-to-end customer experience was, was really immature. So I think we’re at a natural inflection point and evolutionary step in the role of the CMO and the role of marketing in driving growth.', 'The modern CMO needs to be able to manage their profit and loss [P&L] effectively. They have to have a mind-set of delivering ROI [return on investment] on every investment that they make. They need to transform the operating model to be more agile. Agile marketing is the ability to rapidly test and learn. They need to work in true partnership with the technology organization. They also need to attract and nurture the talent to drive world-class performance. They also need to inspire their peers across the C-suite to have the aspiration and the risk appetite to foster this culture of experimentation, bold creative thinking, and the delivery of growth. None of that is trivial.', 'Ultimately, the CMO is being judged on how well they can grow the business.', 'Simon London: I guess the next question is, What does it take for CMOs to deliver against this new mandate? What skills do they need? I know this is something that you’ve been doing some research on, which you will be presenting later this month in Cannes. So Biljana, without giving too much away, just describe the research very briefly and give us some takeaways on what we found.', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: We spoke to over 200 CMOs and over 80 members of the C-suite and the board—CFOs, chief technology officers, and other executives. What we found is that the ability to reach out and influence across the C-suite is becoming increasingly important. The CMO can’t drive the company growth agenda on their own. They really need to build strong working relationships with the rest of the C-suite.', 'So in our research, we identified three archetypes for CMOs. The most successful archetype has the closest relationship with each and every member of the C-suite. They also work closely with the board. Not only does the CMO have a seat at the table in defining the strategy, they also have broader P&L responsibilities that go well beyond what you might expect for a classical or traditional CMO. So they own everything from the marketing agenda to customer experience to product to pricing and so on. They’re also much better at identifying and nurturing talent in house, especially talent that balances creativity and analytics.', 'Simon London: So the research shows a clear correlation between companies that have this archetype of CMO and the growth rates that they’re delivering. Is that right?', 'Jason Heller: Growth companies are eight times more likely to have this archetype of CMO. Companies with this specific CMO archetype are nearly twice as likely to have high growth than companies that have the other archetypes of CMOs. And, again, we’ll be unveiling all of this at Cannes later on this month.', 'If we tie this back to the work that we led last year, which was the integration of data and creativity, this high-performing archetype is three times more likely to attract what we call “whole-brain talent.” These are people who have an understanding and appreciation of reaching across functions—for example, if they’re in data-driven roles, reaching across into the creative and content functions, and if they’re in the creative and content functions, reaching across into analytics—and really embracing these new capabilities, or at least embracing the capabilities that the other side is doing. They’re also three times more likely to have dedicated analytics resources versus their peers, which prevents fighting and competing for priorities for some of the critical analytical capabilities that are required to make that integration happen.', 'When you have data and creativity living hand in hand every single day in practice, that’s what’s actually driving the growth, even more so than having the capabilities. Many companies have those capabilities. Not as many companies are integrating them properly.', 'Simon London: So just say a little more about this notion of cross-C-suite relationships. What are the critical relationships for a successful CMO to get right?', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: The critical relationship for the CMO to build is with their CEO. The CMO really needs to focus on making sure that the CEO is clear on their role: What part of the growth agenda will the CMO drive? And the CMO needs to maintain the proximity with the CEO to make sure that the CEO is clear on the activities that they need to champion or support for marketing investment. There’s a second critical relationship, and that’s with the CFO. We found in our research that only 45 percent of CFOs believe that their CMOs are delivering on their organizational growth agenda.', 'Jason Heller: The CFO is the gatekeeper for the marketing budget. You need to invest in measurement. You need to be able to articulate clearly what the forecast is of the return on that investment. At the end of the day, the whole role of the CFO is to make fiduciary, responsible decisions about the way that investments are made at the organization. For us, it’s really more around marketers needing to get past vanity metrics. Invest properly in the measurement and analytics around investments, so that they come back to the CFO with a credible level of trust that what they’re presenting to them is going to happen.', 'I’ve heard from CFOs of our clients that everybody has a $100 million business case. Nobody delivers on that $100 million business case. And I have to decide which $100 million business case to invest in every year when I’ve got 20 of them being presented to me.', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: Exactly. So CFOs are really looking toward their CMOs to help them translate marketing metrics into the business objectives.', 'It’s not talking about brand awareness, or reaction to creative campaigns, or what the customer-sentiment analysis is telling them but instead about allowing the CFOs to understand exactly how the metrics will give you predictable and accountable growth. How will they drive the top line? Marketers really need to focus in on, What are the metrics that will really drive the business forward? And what’s driving growth?', 'CFOs are really looking toward their CMOs to help them translate marketing metrics into the business objectives.', 'Jason Heller: Another interesting thing is, from other research, we know that the percentage of board members who have marketing experience or a marketing background is really low. It’s on the rise. But you can’t fall off the floor, so it’s starting from a really low place.', 'Everybody thinks they’re a marketer. Everybody has an opinion. And the interaction model between the CMO and the board is probably quite important as well. I think what we’re hearing here is just that should be a level of practical, proactive engagement on the part of the CMO to make sure that the CEO, who ultimately is responsible for the growth of the company; the CFO, who is the gatekeeper to the funding; and the board, who effectively hires and guides the entire C-suite, are fully aligned on what the biggest bets are to drive growth.', 'Simon London: You mentioned there that the relationship between the CMO and the CFO, historically, can be a little bit tricky. Do we know from the research, Are there any other relationships that are standing out as maybe being not quite as smooth as one might hope?', 'Jason Heller: The interesting one, in terms of a relationship that probably could be improved, is that with the CHRO [chief HR officer]. That was a bit of a surprise to us. It hints at some pain points related to attracting and retaining top marketing talent, which is a complex endeavor. It’s not as simple as going out and recruiting and paying people a competitive compensation structure. It’s as much about the value proposition of the organization, the culture, the interaction model with the rest of the marketing organization. We read this as just a struggle to attract talent in general. And that, reading between the lines a little bit, more enablement and empowerment are probably needed at the CHRO level.', 'Simon London: Jason, you mentioned agile marketing. And I think it’s no secret that marketers were some of the first parts of the organization beyond technology to get interested in agile working styles and methodologies. So how far have we come? Is agile commonplace now? Is it broadly adopted across the industry?', 'Jason Heller: I wish I could say that agile marketing was the rule and not the exception. But that’s not the case yet. We are slowly but surely seeing more marketing organizations adopting agile, at least for some of the more addressable, closed-loop parts of their marketing.', 'One of the challenges is you have a lot of individuals who have been in marketing for ten to 20 years and are really comfortable in a certain way of working. And agile actually upends that—repurposes them to be more operators than managers. There is a change of management that’s required there.', 'But agile marketing is one of the most effective ways of modernizing traditional marketers who have operated in slow, waterfall processes for their careers. When you pit, again, creative content, media, analytics, technology, and marketing ops together in a team, that’s where the magic really happens. It makes it possible, for example, to create and launch tests in a matter of days versus a matter of months.', 'Now that’s not true in every channel. That’s not true for every client. There are scale implications there. But this is where the rubber meets the road in terms of the operational reality of how to drive growth more effectively.', 'Agile marketing is one of the most effective ways of modernizing traditional marketers who have operated in slow, waterfall processes for their careers.', 'Simon London: The other thing that’s interesting to me here is that we’ve talked quite a lot about digital, analytics, the growth agenda, business cases, and so on. We haven’t really talked about creativity. Yet when you think about the big brands we all grew up with, they were built on the back of these iconic, memorable, creative campaigns. What’s the role of creativity in this new world? Does it even matter?', 'Jason Heller: Brands still matter. Creativity still matters. And like all things, technology has evolved the way that we develop, deliver, and improve upon the creative ideas and, honestly, the way that we create connections with consumers: emotional connection, that creativity, certain messaging and imagery, and the way that we engage consumers. That all is still as relevant, if not more relevant, where we have less consumer loyalty than we have before.', 'You see creativity thriving in the inspiring work that we see at Cannes every year. A couple of years ago, and in partnership with Cannes, we looked at 16 years of Cannes Lions award data. We created an index of companies that had a trajectory of wins at Cannes—not a direct correlation between winning an award and economic impact, but more the trajectory of creativity. Creativity is a very subjective topic. So if we look at the biggest, most widely recognized award as some proxy to some recognized creativity measure, we’re able to see that total return to shareholders, organic growth, and all of these indices were relatively correlated to the number of awards and the trajectory—the longitudinal nature—of the way that creativity was manifested within an organization.', 'But if we tie this all back to what matters, driving growth, last year’s research found that modern capabilities alone are not enough. Rather it was the integration of data and creativity: that was the accelerant. Companies that integrate data and creativity drive twice the growth rate of their peers. There are a few things that they did to facilitate that. Again, it’s sort of the theme of this conversation: treating data and creativity as equal partners—hiring and nurturing whole-brain talent who are eager to contribute to that integrated equation.', 'And the last one, and maybe the most important one, is adopting a new operating model—adopting agile marketing—where test and learn and curiosity are at the core of both the DNA of the organization as well as the day-to-day operating model.', 'Simon London: Just to be devil’s advocate for a minute, it does strike me, as a layperson, that there’s a fundamental sort of arithmetic at work here. If the marketing organization is spending more on data analytics, data science, building its martech stack, and all that good stuff, surely there are going to be fewer dollars available to spend on creative, copywriting, design, big campaigns, and that kind of thing. Is there any truth in that?', 'Jason Heller: It’s a great question. And I don’t think it’s a zero-sum game. I think that the investments in data and marketing technology, in particular, are unlocking sources of value that didn’t exist before. Therefore if you take a P&L approach to this, you get to a point where the investment in marketing execution and the investment in the enablement and instrumentation to unlock new opportunities will require additional investment.', 'Now in the short term, there are plenty of companies that do make it a zero-sum game because they haven’t proven to themselves yet that there’s an accountability and a predictive quality to the value that they’re going to unlock. But once you get to that point, it’s really easy to make the business case that marketing is just managing P&L. And as the investments in technology, data, customer experience, media, and creative increase, as long as they can forecast what comes out of the tail end of that engine, the investments don’t need to be a zero-sum game.', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: And even going beyond budget, there is the old paradigm of how marketers used to build their creative campaigns: maybe one, two, three campaigns throughout the year. What we’re actually seeing now is more of a shift toward more iterations of those campaigns. And maybe more experimenting, more segmentation, more always-on campaigns.', 'You’re seeing a proliferation of the amount of the creative or the volume of the creative that marketers are creating. This can present some challenges. Creating those new iterations is not only having an impact on the cost that it takes and the engagement with your agencies, but it also has implications in the type of the agency ecosystem that you build for yourself in order to sustain that.', 'Simon London: Just double-click on that, if you don’t mind. What are the implications for agencies in all of this? Do agencies have a future? And, if so, what is it?', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: What we’re seeing is that marketers are having a much more conscious, deliberate, and structured approach to how they work with their agencies. Over the last few years, we’ve seen a few shifts.', 'The first one is an increasing shift toward insourcing, especially in relation to creative and content. That could be very simple creation of quick, cheap, fast, low-risk-type content—for example, creating a new banner ad. We see that being insourced with marketers because it’s less time-consuming, less costly, than engaging the agency. But we also see the “in housing,” or insourcing, of the big idea—the big, creative idea on which all the campaigns will be based. We see that spectrum, from simple activities to the bigger ideas, being insourced.', 'The second big shift is around the evolution of the agency ecosystem. If we think about ten years ago, as Jason mentioned earlier, you can count the number of marketing capabilities on one hand. You have creative, you have media, you have PR, you have promotions, and you have design. What you’ve seen over the last ten years is an explosion in the types of capabilities that you need for marketing. That’s everything from programmatic to media planning to ideation—you name it. It has become increasingly difficult for one agency to provide the one-size-fits-all solution for marketers. So we see a tendency toward marketers being very selective, in terms of the ecosystem and choosing specialist agencies to meet their specialist needs.', 'The third shift that’s been happening with agencies is around the emergence of joint ventures, of partnerships. This could be something as simple as tying more closely the incentive structure for an agency to the success or performance of the marketers or the organization. But we’re also seeing the opportunity where agencies are investing in or cocreating the intellectual property of some of their clients. So they are building close relationships and tying together their performance metrics.', 'Jason Heller: And let me just add to that. Agencies are in the process of reestablishing trust with their clients. There’s been a lot of controversy around transparency in the agency world. As a recovering agency executive, myself, I still see agencies as being as relevant as ever, maybe even more so to help clients navigate a really complex world around them.', 'Most clients are still working with agencies. I think they will continue to do that, despite the rise of insourcing. Agencies are not going away. But there is a crossroads, where we are right now, where agencies just have a lot of trust to reestablish with their clients.', 'Simon London: We’ve talked a fair bit about the rise of data-driven marketing: test and learn, personalization, all of this good stuff. Yet on the other side, we have consumers increasingly nervous about who they give their information to and how it’s being used. We’ve got tightening regulation around how data can be collected and deployed, GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] being the poster child for that. Is this all having a chilling effect on the world of marketing?', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: Data-privacy regulation has had three major implications on marketing.', 'First, marketers require the explicit consent of consumers. This really limits their ability to use the data. And sometimes they’ve been building their databases over a number of years. It really reduces the impact and the value of the assets that they’ve been able to create over the last few years.', 'The second implication is that the climate is forcing marketers to rethink the value exchange with the consumers and customers. It used to be just a checkbox that you could tick, and now marketers need to really push their thinking to say, “What is the value? What’s the value add if a consumer checks the box? And what’s the value add of them joining my database?”', 'The third implication is that there’s far less third-party data available in regulated markets. And that’s just a knock-on effect of the general, overarching privacy laws.', 'Jason Heller: One of the most important pieces there is this need to create the value exchange with consumers. This is a really good thing. Marketers now need to take the time to think about the customer experience, the value exchange, and how we’re actually going to create the value for consumers, which means better experiences and more value created for the marketer. I feel like we’re going to come out of the end of this with much better capabilities in how we engage with consumers in general.', 'Simon London: So marketers, maybe, had gotten a little bit lazy in how they were collecting data and figuring out what they could do with it? Is that fair?', 'Jason Heller: I think that’s right. I’d argue that marketers were not fantastic at using data when they had blanket permission, because they, effectively, were just banking that permission for some later day when they figured it out. Now they don’t have the permission at all. And so it’s really holding marketers to a higher standard of figuring out how to deliver the right experiences to consumers.', 'Most companies are still repurposing their content from traditional channels. So this is a lost opportunity for reaching your consumer in a more mobile,  tailored way.', 'Simon London: Let’s end by looking forward. If you think about the big challenges facing marketers over the next two to five years, what are they? Biljana, maybe you start. What would you put in that bracket?', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: I think the first one is really building in the growth leadership mind-set: building in that culture—and making sure that they’re building the collaboration with their C-suite peers and the rest of the organization but also making sure that they have clarity of role and metrics and making sure that they’re really robust in terms of how they think about the business organization.', 'The second big challenge is around measurement. It’s incredibly important as marketing is stepping more explicitly into the role of driving the growth agenda. If you want to be accountable, then you must make measurement a priority.', 'Simon London: But isn’t that something that’s been a priority every year for the last 20 or 30 years? This whole business of trying to measure your marketing ROI is not a new challenge, right?', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: Simon, you’re right. Marketing effectiveness and measuring marketing ROI have been around for a long time. What has made it more complicated in terms of measurement is what we talked about earlier, which is the proliferation of different channels—the proliferation of touchpoints.', 'Simon London: And as you mentioned earlier, I guess the execution of creative across all these different touchpoints and channels is a challenge as well.', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: And that’s exactly the third challenge. There’s been a lot of discussion around the need for digital-first content. But most companies are still repurposing their content from traditional channels. So this is a lost opportunity for reaching your consumer in a more mobile, tailored way. It’s a missed opportunity in engaging your customers in a deeper way—in the touchpoints where they want to be reached—and really creating these personal experiences across all the addressable channels.', 'Simon London: Jason, what comes to mind for you if we think about challenges for the next few years?', 'Jason Heller: I’m going to shift us from challenges, to maybe end us on a bit of an inspirational note. I think the next phase of digital and marketing transformation is really a move from doing to being—a move from companies doing agile marketing to companies being agile marketing organizations, a move from doing things that are customer centric to being customer-centric organizations, a move from doing analytics to becoming data driven. It needs to be in the DNA of the organization. That’s what creates the performance-oriented culture that can deliver the accountability that we’ve talked about, the predictable growth to the organization. That really is something new.', 'Simon London: So we are out of time for today. Jason and Biljana, thank you so much for doing this.', 'Jason Heller: Thanks for having us.', 'Biljana Cvetanovski: Thank you, Simon.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as ever, to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

65,Globalization’s next chapter,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/globalizations-next-chapter,"Globalization isn’t in retreat, but it has morphed into a very different phenomenon, increasingly powered by trade in services and by intraregional trade.","['Globalization isn’t in retreat, but it has morphed into a very different phenomenon, increasingly powered by trade in services and by intraregional trade.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey Global Institute partner Susan Lund about the changing dynamics of global value chains, which are transforming the meaning of globalization. Trade in services (as opposed to goods) has continued to rise, while intraregional trade has intensified. Underlying it all is the impact of automation on low-skill jobs—which will ultimately increase the need for innovation in operations, manufacturing, and supply chains.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be discussing globalization and trade, a topic that is very much in the news. As we’ll hear, however, there are forces at work much bigger than the trade policies of any one government. The flow of goods and services across the world is determined by the sourcing decisions of millions of companies. Those decisions are driven, in turn, by patterns of demand, assessments of risk, and the march of technology. To discuss all this, I spoke with Susan Lund, a partner with the McKinsey Global Institute, who is based in Washington, DC. If you want some bedtime reading on this one, you can download the report, Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains, which you can find on McKinsey.com. Susan, thanks so much for doing this. And welcome back to the podcast.', 'Susan Lund: Happy to be here.', 'Simon London: There’s a lot of political rhetoric and some policy action around trade, tariffs, talk of protectionism. So the opening question is, have we reached peak globalization? Is globalization in retreat, and what do the numbers tell us?', 'Susan Lund: Yes, sometime around the mid-2000s, the dynamics began to change. We didn’t see this immediately, because we had the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. Trade flows plunged in 2008, 2009. A lot of us thought, “Well, when the recovery gets going in the US and Europe, then trade will ‘go back to normal.’” Now we’re ten years out from that point, and we can look back and see, in fact, we’re in a very different chapter of globalization.', 'The trade intensity of manufactured goods is going down. That means more goods that are produced are now sold in the country they’re produced in. They’re not traded or exported and imported. But at the same time, we see services trade continues to grow much faster than goods trade. So, increasingly, globalization is about trade in various forms of services, like IT services and telecommunications, transportation, business services, and these types of things.', 'Our image of globalization, for many of us, is really of companies deciding to offshore production to countries where wages are very, very low. And, indeed, that defined a lot of what we saw in the 1990s and early 2000s.', 'But, increasingly, we find that’s only a small share of global goods trade today. And it’s declining. Low wages are no longer the driving force in global trade flows. But then the flip side is, well, if low wages aren’t so important, what are companies looking for? And here we find that R&D and innovation and investment in intangible assets are increasingly important in virtually every industry that we look at. This means that to get those things, you want to think about production in places where there’s a skilled workforce in engineers and a start-up ecosystem.', 'The final big change is just that we often talk about globalization, but over the last five years what we see, increasingly, is regionalization. Trade within regions like the EU-28 or the Asia–Pacific region is growing much faster than the long-haul global trade.', 'Simon London: So just double click, if you don’t mind, on the trade-intensity point that you mentioned at the front end, if the percentage of output that is traded across borders is declining, in my own rather naughty layperson’s way, that says to me that globalization, in some sense, is in reverse. So declining trade intensity, is it a bad thing?', 'Susan Lund: No, I don’t think it’s a bad thing at all. It actually reflects the shift in where the world’s consumers are. Increasingly, China and other developing countries are home to a growing consuming class—people spending money on all sorts of goods. This explains why less goods are being traded. So what’s produced in China is now sold in China.', 'By 2030, we predict that emerging-market consumers are going to account for more than half of global demand. This means that a lot of foreign companies and domestic companies that are producing in these countries are going to sell to the consumers in those countries. It’s actually a sign of economic development and strength.', 'Simon London: Let’s talk a little bit more about the trade in services. As you say, the official stats show that cross-border trade in services is growing very fast. Now, I’ve seen in the research that this is both very difficult to measure and that the official statistics may understate global trade in services. Do you want to talk a little bit about that?', 'Susan Lund: Services trade has always been the poor stepsister of manufactured goods; trade negotiations often focus on things like cars or agricultural products. And services are harder to measure. But they are increasingly traded and, especially for advanced countries like the US, we’re running a very large surplus in traded services. That would be exports of business services, transportation services, tourism, and education. In the future, we might see more trade in healthcare, remote healthcare.', 'These are important, not only for countries but for companies. One of the things we found is that if you take a traded manufactured product, like an automobile, 30 percent of the value in creating that automobile comes from the services that go into it. That includes the R&D and design. It would include the accounting and legal services, and engineering services. It includes the distribution and logistics services, as well as the marketing and sales services.', 'So even though we talk a lot about trade in goods, the service component of goods is incredibly important. And it’s growing more important. If you added up the services component of manufactured goods—if you considered all the intangible assets that global companies shift around the world, as well as these free digital services, like music and video streaming or internet search and email—it could well be that the value of traded services is already greater than the value of traded goods. For some specific countries, including the United States, our overall trade balance would look very different if you appropriately accounted for all the exports of services.', 'Simon London: Another trend that you mentioned is the declining importance, even within goods, of lower-value-added goods and the decreasing importance of the labor-arbitrage model, where you have exports from low-wage countries to high-wage countries. Talk a little bit more about how that’s declined and why that’s declined.', 'Susan Lund: What we found is that if you look at the goods trade today, only 18 percent is an export from a low-wage country to a high-wage one. We’re defining “low wage” as countries where income per capita is one-fifth or less of the importing country’s. That’s already an astonishingly small component, given that our image of globalization is often about offshoring to low-wage countries. So already, in many, many, industries, there are other factors driving global trade.', 'Even when you look at the types of manufacturing that traditionally have used a lot of labor—like apparel, textiles, toys, and shoes—the value of trade going from a low-wage country to a high-wage country is declining even in those industries. In textiles and apparel, 55 percent of global trade was an export from a low-wage country to a high-wage country [about] ten years ago. Today that’s down to 43 percent.', 'The reason is automation. In all types of manufacturing, more and more production is being done by machines. When you start to automate production, then labor costs, in general, aren’t as important. And instead, you’re looking at different things. First of all, where can I get high-skill labor? Where can I get the engineers and the technicians to run the machines, to maintain the machines? You also then start to look at things like energy costs and electricity costs and the quality of infrastructure and logistics.', 'Many companies are also prioritizing speed to market. We see this, for instance, in fashion. As soon as, say, Kate Middleton or Kim Kardashian wears something, suddenly that item stocks out of shelves. Producers are now being caught up in the vagaries of social media driving trends and tastes. We see this not only in things like fashion but all sorts of consumer products. Consumer tastes and demands seem to be shifting more quickly, and product cycles are shortening. All of this, then, favors putting production close to large consumer markets, like the US or Europe, not halfway around the world, where goods might take 30 days on a ship to reach the market.', 'Simon London: You mentioned automation and a little earlier you mentioned telemedicine. Is there a sense in which the role of technology is changing? We know that technology has massively reduced transaction costs—particularly cross-border transaction-coordination costs—facilitating global trade in many ways. Is there a sense that with telemedicine, with automation, with robotics, that maybe there’s a wave of technology coming that doesn’t have quite such a simple effect and may encourage the onshoring of production that may previously have been offshored or nearshored?', 'Susan Lund: What we see are two opposing forces from technology. On one hand, you still have technologies that will make trade more efficient, faster, and lower cost. That would tend to boost global trade. These are technologies like blockchain to track where goods come from or to automate payout of trade credit in insurance contracts; the Internet of Things, where you can now track a shipment of goods as it moves around the world with more precision; automated document processing in customs; or autonomous vehicles in ports, which streamline the amount of time it takes to load and unload a ship.', 'All of these things will continue to encourage more and more goods to be traded as it gets faster and cheaper to do so. But then, on the other hand, you see these technologies that we’ve started to talk about—like automation or 3-D printing or artificial intelligence—that will start to favor producing goods in different parts of the world. That could actually reduce global trade flows.', 'Simon London: I’m going to make a very simplistic point here. As a layperson, we do tend to get somewhat fixated on the politics and the rhetoric and the tariffs. And as you say, those are real, and those could impose real costs or, indeed, on the other side reduce the cost of global trade. But, actually, our picture of globalization is a function of some very big multidecade exogenous forces, like the role of technology, like economic development, like the pattern of global demand. All sorts of things are driving this that are way, way bigger than what the policy makers in any one country will do. That is probably a very naive observation. But would you agree with that?', 'Susan Lund: I would absolutely agree with that. And I don’t think it’s a naive observation. I think it’s exactly what our report highlighted—that the ultimate trade numbers we talk about are really the result of the decisions of millions and millions of businesses deciding where to source inputs, where to produce goods, where to sell to consumers. Then it all adds up. Ironically, this is why you saw, at the end of 2018, that the US came in with the largest trade deficit ever in history.', 'You might be surprised and say why? Well, because tariffs were put on a whole lot of imported inputs that companies could not very quickly find an alternative source for. That just meant that the value of imports went up. At the same time, many countries retaliated against US agricultural products, like soybeans. Well, it is easy to switch your soybean source from, say, the US to Brazil. You can do that very quickly. But you can’t very quickly switch out a very particular automotive component that you’re importing. And so, ironically, the US ended up with a larger trade deficit than ever.', 'Simon London: One more trend you mentioned at the start that we haven’t really gone back to yet. But let’s talk a little bit more about regionalization—the emergence of these more intraregional trade flows. Again, what’s driving that? And what are the implications?', 'Susan Lund: When you look purely at the data, a lot of integration within the EU-28 and within the Asia–Pacific region is driving this increase in regionalization. But the more fundamental reason is that companies are thinking more about things like speed to market. There’s also a lot of focus on integrating with your suppliers.', 'In the 1990s and early 2000s, these offshore-supplier relationships halfway around the world were arm’s length. Now, there are a variety of different reasons why companies are thinking about how they can collaborate with their suppliers or how they can set up integrated digital platforms to improve the efficiency between the supplier and the user of the input. To do that, you need to have a relationship with that supplier. You need to know them. You need to agree to co-invest. Companies are even collaborating on things like product design and manufacturing processes. All of that favors having suppliers that are nearer in your region rather than 12 hours away, on the other side of the globe.', 'Simon London: The other fascinating thing, from everything that you’re saying, is that this is a very different pattern, on multiple levels, from the pattern of globalization we saw previously. For many people, probably including me, that’s still my mental model of what globalization is. It’s not regional trade. It’s not services. It’s ships full of relatively low-value-added goods sailing around the world. If I’m an executive, if I’m running a big company or playing a part in the management of a big company, what do I do to make sure that I’m really playing to win in the new era and not fighting yesterday’s battle?', 'Susan Lund: Companies around the world are increasingly rethinking their global strategy. We did a survey of over 1,000 business executives last September. We found that three-quarters of them say they are reconsidering their globalization strategy. So this is a very active issue that companies are debating, partly because of the tariffs but, more fundamentally, because of these changes in relative costs and what new technologies are enabling.', 'Of those executives, nearly half say that they are changing their global footprint already, that they’re increasing investments in some countries and decreasing them in others. Almost a quarter say they’re investing more in domestic, local supply chains rather than foreign sources of inputs, so that they don’t have to worry about tariffs and other trade barriers altogether. That’s a huge change from what we saw in the previous chapter of globalization.', 'Leading companies are already at the forefront of these changes. And, indeed, what we see is that some of them are already profiting. We talked about the need to collaborate with your suppliers. Analysis of a survey done by McKinsey’s Operations Practice found that the manufacturing companies that say they collaborate closely with their suppliers on a range of production and design issues are growing their profitability much faster than companies that say they only minimally collaborate with their suppliers. The ones that say they don’t collaborate at all with their suppliers over the last five years have seen their profitability decline.', 'A public example that’s been written about in the press is Columbia Sportswear, where they will design products to minimize the overall tariff impact. For instance, if you have a pair of leggings, if you put a pocket on it, it then becomes a pair of pants, which have a different tariff rate than leggings. It’s a very simple example. But the idea that you are engineering and designing a product to minimize tariffs and changing the design of the product or of the fabrics you use or how you classify it, I think, is really fascinating.', 'Simon London: Let’s segue to the policy maker’s view of the world. Again, if I’m thinking about economic development, particularly in a developing economy, and also in developed economies, how do I make sure that I’m thinking forward and not looking back at the previous chapter of globalization when I think about my policy actions and where to place my bets and how to try and position my country in this new world?', 'Susan Lund: It’s very clear that the trends I’ve talked about will favor advanced economies, because they are the ones with the skilled workforce, the good logistics infrastructure, the engineering and high-skill talent, the intellectual-property protections. These trends really favor the US, European countries, and, say, South Korea, Japan.', 'They stand to benefit a lot not only from the trade in services but even perhaps from picking up and accelerating manufacturing growth. That’s not going to, necessarily, replace the millions of manufacturing jobs lost in the US since 2000, because as we talked about, a lot of this production is automated. But the jobs that are created are very high wage and high skill. It’s ironic and unfortunate that in many advanced economies, policy seems to be focused on the losses from 20 years ago and on globalization and the job losses and the restructuring of global-production networks rather than looking forward to capturing the opportunities that are now arising.', 'For developing countries, the outlook is much less clear. We don’t think that the opportunity to engage in labor-intensive manufacturing is over yet. But that window of opportunity is closing. You do see that countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh are still growing their exports very rapidly and building up these export industries. But over time, that’s going to become less available for other countries that have not yet participated in global value chains. I’m thinking, in particular, of a lot of African countries. Then the question is, well, what could be the next development ladder to take you from agriculture? You used to go into low-skill manufacturing. Then you moved into higher-value-added manufacturing and services.', 'One thought is can services be that ladder? Certainly, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and India are three countries that have built up service-export industries, with call centers, IT help desks, and so on. A lot of that basic work is also automatable, done by algorithms and AI. For those countries to maintain their service exports, they’re going to have to get into more complicated things like sales and troubleshooting IT problems, not simply providing very basic information.', 'Simon London: We do make this distinction between labor-intensive services and knowledge-intensive services. It’s like not all services are created equal. It’s a very, very big and complicated bucket.', 'Susan Lund: That’s absolutely true. We think there will be increasing opportunities to trade and export in knowledge-intensive services. But, increasingly, labor-intensive services, like call-center work, that simply give someone an account balance—that can be done by a machine.', 'Technology could also create wholly new opportunities for low-income countries. We see this, for instance, in the surge in mobile payments and mobile banking. That started in Kenya with M-Pesa. Now you see it in China. Countries that had pretty underdeveloped payments networks, and never went through a period when most adults had a formal bank account, are skipping over that stage directly and just going to mobile-banking accounts based on phones. That’s an opportunity that we call technology leapfrogging.', 'Maybe there are going to be other opportunities as well, where developing countries will really benefit from new technologies and skip over whole phases of development, like the path taken in the US or European countries, where we all had bank accounts and checkbooks and we carried around cash. Developing countries are going directly to paying with your phone.', 'Simon London: Does regionalization potentially offer some interesting new opportunities to become a regional hub for processing or manufacturing services?', 'Susan Lund: There’s a whole range of goods that aren’t widely traded—things like heavy commodities, like steel and aluminum, and like food and beverages that are perishable. There’s a lot of opportunity for more regional trade, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. The regional-trade figures for those parts of the world are very, very low—say, 20 percent of trade is within regions in those parts of the world, as opposed to with the rest of the world. Two-thirds of trade within the EU-28 is just between countries in the EU-28; only one-third is with the rest of the world. There is a big opportunity to create regional trading blocs in Africa, in Latin America, in the Middle East. That does give me some hope. You’re starting to see it in East Africa with the East African Community. They have a customs union.', 'The outlook for individual countries is really different. We can’t use general, global observations, particularly in the developing world. There will be opportunities. But it’s going to require much more nuanced, careful policy making to look at the data and the facts and think about where the opportunities for a country are going forward.', 'Simon London: I think we’re out of time for the day. But Susan Lund, thank you so much, as always, for your time.', 'Susan Lund: Thank you. It’s my pleasure.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

66,Getting beyond gridlock: The promise of traffic congestion solutions,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/traffic-congestion-solutions,"With more than half the world’s population living in cities, congestion and pollution are worsening. Technology may be able to provide new and innovative traffic congestion solutions—but only if city governments and companies collaborate.","['With more than half the world’s population living in cities, congestion and pollution are worsening. Technology may be able to provide new and innovative traffic congestion solutions—but only if city governments and companies collaborate.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partner Stefan Knupfer and associate partner Swarna Ramanathan about what seamless mobility in cities really means, what it will take to get there, and the massive benefit it could bring to people, government, and business alike.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast with me, Simon London. If you listen to this podcast, you probably live or work in a city. And if you live or work in a city, you know that getting from A to B is often difficult and time consuming. Extra point if you’re listening to this episode while stuck in traffic. But it doesn’t have to be this way. As we’ll hear, a number of technologies are converging in a way that could make getting around in cities a whole lot easier. Autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, ridesharing, smart traffic systems, predictive maintenance. Each of these is interesting in its own right, but put them all together in the right way and we could end up with cities that are a lot cleaner, more efficient, and more livable. To discuss the issues, I spoke with McKinsey senior partner Stefan Knupfer and associate partner Swarna Ramanathan. You can read more about their research in the article, “The road to seamless urban mobility.” Stefan and Swarna, welcome to the podcast.', 'Stefan Knupfer: Simon, delighted to be here.', 'Swarna Ramanathan: Thank you, very happy to be here, Simon.', 'Simon London: Stefan, we’re going to be talking about urban mobility, moving around in cities. At the risk of a terrible pun, that, in some ways, sounds like a very pedestrian topic. Why should we be talking about this now? Why does this matter as a topic?', 'Stefan Knupfer: Because cities have more than 50 percent of the population worldwide, and that figure will grow to 60 percent by 2030. Cities are seeing a significant increase in congestion, so it’s more and more difficult for people to move around in cities. For example, we have increased congestion in London, Paris, New York, and if you think about New York and LA, I think the congestion increased over the past six years by approximately 30 percent. This is significant.', 'Then cities need to be healthier, however it will get more congested, it will get more polluted, and I think that’s a significant issue. So far, we have not found a solution. It just takes you longer to get around, it’s getting more expensive, and it’s more unhealthy to live in cities.', 'Simon London: So things are getting worse, not better? More people are living in cities, there’s more congestion, more pollution, and yet, we think there is hope in sight. Swarna, why should we be optimistic and hopeful?', 'Swarna Ramanathan: We can be optimistic and hopeful because there are lots of technologies in place. If we think about autonomous vehicles, it’s not just self-driving cars, but also self-driving trains, buses, shuttles (Exhibit 1). For example, in December 2018, Waymo announced the launch of a commercial autonomous-vehicle taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona.', '', 'Connectivity is another one. Again, it’s not just connected cars, but looking at connected intersections, traffic signals, crosswalks, using the Internet of Things, et cetera. How do you get a cohesive ecosystem of connected technologies help you relieve traffic and hence relieve pollution and make people go from point A to point B in a more seamless way?', 'Another one is electrification. Most OEMs have announced launches of electric vehicles in the next couple of years. It’s not just cars again. It’s buses, bikes, scooters, commercial vehicles as well. We shouldn’t underestimate the congestion and pollution costs by commercial vehicles in the cities. So electric vehicles in all those arenas and spaces.', 'Stefan Knupfer: One addition to what Swarna just said: The interesting thing is, why cities? Because all those technologies, honestly, by themselves, have a significant trend. And if you combine them in a city which is happening, you have a revolution. So I think the speeds that everything is changing on the mobility side right now comes through the combination.', 'Simon London: So it’s not just electric vehicles on their own. It’s not just autonomous vehicles on their own, or connected cars, or traffic systems, or ridesharing, it’s not any of those individually, it’s the confluence of all of that. If you put it all together, then potentially, you’ve got something revolutionary, is that the gist?', 'Stefan Knupfer: I think that’s exactly the gist. And I think you’re also describing it in a perfect way, Simon, because all of this needs to come together. That’s exactly why we call it seamless mobility.', 'Simon London: Bring that to life for us a little bit. If I’m an urban dweller, trying to get around within a city, what is the seamless-mobility future like for me?', 'Stefan Knupfer: It is interesting, because you will actually use very similar means of transportation that you are used to. The difference is only today, all of them are not connected, they are pretty much independent systems, they do not communicate with each other. The moment you make it seamless, you’re using all those different modes of transportation in a seamless way. Which means the moment I say, in a city I want to go from a point A to a point B, I go online and I will know exactly what’s the safest, what’s the most affordable, what’s the fastest way to go from a point A to B. If I’m by myself, if I need to transport something, if I will have friends with me, it will offer me different ways of doing this.', 'Swarna Ramanathan: For example, you might share an autonomous shuttle to get to the railway station, and then take a train into the city center. And then maybe use an electric scooter or robo-taxi, to go on to your destination from the city-center train station. So that makes your transit more seamless, and point to point. It’s door to door using multiple modes of transport. That’s what the consumers would see, but behind the scenes, they expect connectivity, and intelligent traffic systems, advanced train signaling, and predictive maintenance that would keep these trains and the remainder of the connected transportation systems running more smoothly with fewer delays and breakdowns, as compared to today.', 'Stefan Knupfer: The combination is very often, I think, the most difficult part when you are trying to use public transportation to get to the station. If you can find a way that you get to the station, again, in a safe way, in a convenient way, the usage of public transportation becomes much more convenient. But again, that means that every transportation means needs to be connected, and therefore needs to do so online. That is the only way that you can connect it.', 'Simon London: We are not imagining a future state in which, for example, trains go away, and we’re all buzzing around the city in autonomous flying whatevers. Our future with seamless mobility certainly has a big component of things that we are all familiar with.', 'Stefan Knupfer: I must admit, Simon, I don’t want to forecast how cities are going to look in 50 years. Because if you’d asked me 15, 20 years ago, if what we’re talking about right now is even close to reality, I would have said no. Because the technology development is so significant. That’s also why we’re talking about 2030, 2040. I recently served a client who is in the area of flying around. They had significantly more advanced ideas that I would not even imagine, so I’d be very, very careful. We might fly around in cities much faster than we believe.', 'Simon London: What do we think, if we could get to a world of seamless mobility, what’s the upside?', 'Stefan Knupfer: If you succeed, and also based on modeling, if the seamless mobility in the city actually works, we will have an increased transportation capacity of about 30 percent. That means about 30 percent more passenger miles that we can travel. We’re doing this by cutting down on travel times by about 30 percent.', 'The cost will also go down significantly. So therefore, every time the costs go down, demand goes up, more people want to go. But the nice thing is we have the opportunity that more people can move around. And we still move them around in significantly shorter time.', 'The most important piece is that the greenhouse-gas emissions will go down significantly. We have numbers that are significant because we talk about emissions going down by 80 percent. That obviously requires that we are fully electrified in the vehicles. So as long as you have combustion engines in the cities, it’s not going to happen. But the moment you have electrical vehicles, even if the energy generation is not perfectly clean, at least you keep it outside of the city.', 'Simon London: Presumably, there are also big societal benefits here, as well. So just talk a little bit beyond the economics and beyond the sort of saved minutes and more miles.', 'Stefan Knupfer: So we already talked about greenhouse gas. The autonomous is primarily going to be safer. Because if you think about it, 95 percent of deadly accidents are driving errors. Out of this, 30 percent is actually drunk driving. About 30 percent is that people are just not being aware of what’s going on on the street. A machine doesn’t do this. If I make a driving mistake, I hopefully learn from it. Hopefully. The machine, actually the entire system is going to learn from it. So therefore, the system learning in this case is going to be—just from a probability standpoint—it will be safer.', 'People actually like autonomous driving, even today. Not when it’s in the city, because in the city, there is no fun driving. You have stop and go all the time. The only thing is, you’re busy driving, and you can’t do anything else.', 'There’s a lot of people who like their cars, and like the driving experience, and the [turning]. This is something you still can do in the countryside. So as long as you have a steering wheel in your car, you can actually do both. You can do autonomous and you can do your own thing. The last point that I’d like to raise here, as a benefit, is also it has an economic benefit. And I think that’s important in our report, that everything that we propose makes economic sense. Just to give you an example, those new transportation services could be about 40 percent of transportation revenue in 2030.', 'That means for a city like London, our beautiful city, about $10 billion of additional revenue on the transportation side. And if you multiply this by all big cities in the world, you realize how big this industry will be.', 'Simon London: And that’s things like ridesharing, robo-taxis, bike-sharing schemes. If you add all those up, we think 40 percent of the transportation-related revenues, could be this new stuff?', 'Stefan Knupfer: That’s exactly right.', 'Simon London: So this all sounds fantastic. We’ve got a cleaner, safer, more efficient transportation system within cities, a world of seamless mobility. What’s the catch?', 'Swarna Ramanathan: The catch is that seamless mobility will not happen without a close public and private cooperation. This will not be solved by either of them alone. For example, cities should be encouraging the use of shared autonomous vehicles but also controlling the number of autonomous vehicles that come onto the street.', 'You really need innovation from the private sector, but also a little bit of controlling force from the public sector and the policies. Our research shows that if robo-taxis and autonomous shuttles become widely available in an unconstrained way, congestion would only get worse and not better. While there could be many benefits—more point-to-point trips, potential lower greenhouse-gas emissions—like Stefan was mentioning, you’re going to open up travel to a completely new segment of people who are not traveling today. But we wouldn’t be maximizing the potential of technology if there’s no good private and public partnership.', 'Stefan Knupfer: Building on Swarna’s point, if you do it in an unconstrained way, and you’re not using all the technologies that we mentioned in a seamless interaction, you might get some disadvantages, at least in the short term.', 'For example, in New York, the more Uber cars you have, and the more people like them and use them, what you get is people using less public transportation. We strongly believe that you need to have public transportation, and you need to expand capacities there. So it’s the combination of it; it shouldn’t take away. The second is if you have more driving on the street, and you do this combustion engine, you obviously make the pollution worse, you make the congestion worse. The congestion obviously leads to more pollution, all those different things.', 'Therefore, in the transition, it’s not going to be easy, and that’s exactly why you have to have a strategy and know where you want to get to. And then to Swarna’s point, you have to be very organized between public and private. If we just let it go, it’s going to take us probably ten years longer and much more hardship and much more money.', 'And the cities can’t wait, because the point is that you have those congestion-pollution problems today, and what cities do at this point right now, they ban vehicles, they ban cars out of the city. Which is nice to walk, but on the other side, it takes you significantly longer.', 'Simon London: You’ve mentioned the word robo-taxis, and we’ve talked about autonomous vehicles, even autonomous shuttles as something that was probably part of the solution set (see Exhibit 2 for details on the opportunities for autonomous vehicles in the United States). Realistically, when do we think some of those things are going to be hitting the streets, at any kind of scale?', '', 'Swarna Ramanathan: It really depends on which part of the world you’re talking about. You already see Waymo is doing different pilots and trying to bring it to a commercial sense in Arizona. But it might not be the same case if you think about India or China as an example.', 'There are different models in terms of infrastructure and regulation. There needs to be careful coordination and synchronization. It’s not a straightforward answer to say, yes, robo-taxis are going to come in 2020.', 'Stefan Knupfer: If you’re in a more Western, developed city, and you live in a safer city, it’s easier to go to autonomous. So therefore, you see the modern Western cities, and then a lot of the smaller European cities, leading. So Helsinki, Oslo. They’re smaller cities in Europe, but obviously, they’re very modern cities. So they’re actually well organized, so they go very quickly in those things.', 'On the other side, I believe cities that will be kind of newly built, a lot of the Chinese cities, have all the opportunities to leapfrog.', 'Then you have cities like Mumbai or Mexico City. They’re big cities, but the infrastructure’s not necessarily there. They have absolutely the need from congestion and pollution standpoints to do something significant. On the other side, their starting point is relatively difficult in some of those areas. You will see some of them advancing significantly. But they’re not necessarily the ones that are going to lead us in the next ten years. I think the other thing is, I think when you talk about timing, I think you have to understand what kind of autonomy.', 'For example, I don’t want to get too technical, but as described from a level of one to a level of five, level five means everywhere, anywhere in the world, driving is autonomous, nobody has a steering wheel anymore.', 'Now think about driving through the desert in Arizona, or you drive through the jungles somewhere in Africa, or something like this. There are a lot of roads out there that are probably better suited to autonomous driving.', 'So, level four, where you have something organized, and you can actually have a relatively simple infrastructure. Think about highways, think about New York City, you’re driving east or west, you’re driving north and south, and you’re driving from traffic to traffic. It’s relatively organized, and it’s relatively simple to build an infrastructure that allows you to coordinate there. That’s what you call level four.', 'It’s a little bit restrained. If you go there, people talk about they can do this within the next ten years very easily. The technology is there, and therefore people talk about being able to do it within the next three to five years.', 'Simon London: So we would argue that—it’s a big generalization—but a lot of infrastructure spend should really be on the smart infrastructure at this point. It’s the connectivity, and the intelligence, and existing infrastructure that probably will get you more bang for your buck.', 'Stefan Knupfer: There’s a big budget in every city and state, and probably also the federal government, for building additional roads. Now, building additional roads is, in my understanding, a complete waste. Because if this happens ten years from now, we generate significantly more free capacity.', 'Just think about autonomous vehicles, they’re not doing stop and go. They all have the same distance, because they don’t have a reaction time, they can drive much faster, they can drive much closer.', 'All of a sudden, you’re using significantly more of the road capacity. Right now, we’re using an average of about 10 percent of road capacity that we built. Now, building more roads is probably that more people will drive, but it’s not going to solve our problem. And therefore, changing budgets, and that’s a little bit difficult, I believe, because if somebody has money allocated to a specific area, it’s very difficult to say, Do you know what? I’ll take a radical cut here and move it completely to the other side.', 'Usually, we do some small cuts. But small cuts don’t lead to revolutions. I think the quality of the roads needs to improve, but I don’t think we need to see significantly more roads.', 'Simon London: Put yourselves in the shoes for a minute of a mayor or a city planner. How do I approach this? I understand that there’s a lot of change coming, and there’s potentially a big role for me to coordinate and bring parties together, to get to rational solutions here. Where do I begin?', 'Stefan Knupfer: That’s a terrific question. And to be quite honest, we are in the very fortunate situation that we are allowed to talk to a lot of mayors at this point. Interestingly enough, not only about mobility but also about smart cities. We work with an organization called C40 that connects about I think 93 or 96 large major cities right now. More than 25 percent of world GDP, 500 million to 600 million people. Therefore, through this, we have the opportunity to talk to mayors. We know this is a positive development.', 'On the other side, it can be pretty messy on the way there, so therefore, we recommend pretty much to every mayor, you have to develop a mobility strategy that is ten, 15, 20 years out for your city. But it gives you a very clear indication not only for the people who live in your city, and vote for you, and need to understand why you’re spending all the money, but also to the private sector—that the private sector is ready to invest, but if you don’t know if you’re allowed to invest, or even if it makes sense in a city, you’re sitting there and saying, The city has to do something. Now, the city doesn’t have the experience, the city doesn’t necessarily have the money. The money and new technologies are in the private sector. They both actually have to come together in a significantly better way. I do believe the starting point needs to be a city saying, I’m willing to take this on.', 'The second thing is, we talked on the mobility side about 40 ideas, 40 major things that you can come up with. Again, we don’t think that every city needs 40 of them. Because a lot of them are already in place. So you could get it down to ten or 15, that’s a number that you can manage. That’s very, very important. Don’t try to follow every lead, don’t try to follow every technology. Try to be very clear what you want to do, and then lay out exactly those ten, 15 things that you need to do. The moment you have ten, 15, you can also put the money next to it, you can put the management attention next to it.', 'This focus, that you understand what is important in the short term, what are the next steps, what are the technologies I can implement right now—I think that’s important, but you have to have the big picture, because otherwise, as I said before, you start banning vehicles out of a city. That’s a solution, but honestly, that doesn’t make you move around faster, it doesn’t help you with your delivery. You have to find better ways that those vehicles move around. I think that’s the better solution.', 'Simon London: You’ve mentioned that there are 40 or so levers or tools that are at the disposal of cities and city governments. Just explain those a little bit, without going through all 40, what are some of the tools that I’ve got?', 'Swarna Ramanathan: At the highest level, there are three ways for cities to get to a seamless mobility according to our research. One is optimizing supply. Another one is optimizing the demand for transport. And the third one is improving sustainability.', 'If I had to pick a couple of them, very tactically, intelligent traffic systems, which include lights that send traffic and communicate with each other, to minimize the times that you and I would spend in traffic jams and really maximize movement. They all would also allow for dynamic lane allocation, which shifts lanes to the direction with more traffic. Smart parking is a technology that connects vehicles to infrastructure, or even vehicles to vehicles, to inform you where parking is available. They both are proven technologies.', 'Intelligent traffic systems have reduced commuting time in Buenos Aires by about 20 percent. Smart parking has reduced searching time for parking by about five minutes on average, in Johannesburg and in San Francisco.', 'These have significant impact on normal commuters’ lives by saving time. But they are also pretty simple solutions that any city could think of, because they’re existing technologies, available in most cities.', 'Stefan Knupfer: I like a lot where Swarna is going, because I think there are a few no-regret moves. There are one or two that I would like to add. Night delivery. Why do we deliver during the day? The only reason is because if a vehicle is not autonomous, it makes noise. Noise is primarily the trucks that obviously are diesel trucks, and they go backwards and make noise, and all of this is not going to happen in the future. You have electrical vehicles, you don’t need to make noise, because you know your surroundings.', 'So deliver at night, which means that you take the trucks and the delivery away from the day. If you go to a city these days, you see right and left trucks going to retail stores. Everybody is slaloming through the streets. Delivering at night opens up the whole street. And it’s also easier for the delivery trucks to deliver at night because during the day, they can’t park.', 'The other thing is, why is it that every delivery truck that goes long distance ending up in New York needs to go over the George Washington Bridge and then deliver somewhere in Manhattan?', 'Why aren’t we using urban consolidation centers, which means they go to New Jersey, in an urban consolidation center and they repackage from the big trucks into smaller ones. And the smaller ones are all electrical, and they only go to a specific zip code. All of a sudden, it looks very different in a city.', 'Simon London: But again, it’s a big coordination issue, isn’t it? Because there are all these private- sector players, and they’re all doing what’s rational for them, and what minimizes the cost for them currently. They’re used to having their trucks coming into the city, but getting to a more rational solution for the city as a whole takes an enormous amount of coordination and a lot of different parties.', 'Swarna Ramanathan: Yes, it takes a tremendous amount of coordination, but it’s not impossible, Simon. Cities like Barcelona are piloting this night-delivery system that Stefan was just explaining. They have seen very good results. Travel times have been reduced by five minutes during the daytime, because they were able to move a lot of deliveries to be done during the nighttime. So it’s possible, it’s not impossible.', 'Simon London: And what about the private-sector side? If I’m a CEO here, what are the opportunities for me? Why should I be excited about this?', 'Stefan Knupfer: You should be excited because there are significant business opportunities in the first place. Where there is new technology and new business opportunities, I hope that would excite CEOs to invest. Now again, as we said, I would only invest if I know that there is a city that I can work with. That’s exactly why we said the public and the private sectors need to interact.', 'We thought about four layers that you could think through, as a city, but also obviously as a business: infrastructure layer, a rolling-stock layer, a digital-analytics layer, and a user-interface layer. The infrastructure layer is literally the very basic hard assets. For example, roads, rail lines, but also, for example, charging infrastructure for electrical vehicles.', 'Rolling stock is another one. Very simple, we talk about trains, we talk about buses, but we also talk about robo-taxis, we talk about minibuses and minishuttles. We talk about electrical bicycles and scooters. This is all the different kind of vehicles that are moving around on the surface.', 'The next one, it becomes pretty clear, because the moment, as we talked about, if you want to go from a point A to B, and you change different modes, you need to understand all the different steps that you go through in your mobility. This means you’re talking about analytical and digital layers, like ticketing, like payments, like mapping, like vehicle vouching, congestion pricing. We talked about the intelligent traffic lights that all need to be connected. Preferred lanes.', 'Then the most interesting one, and people like to forget about it, but think about it, we all like our smartphones. It’s going to be, probably, the device we’ll use to manage mobility going forward. But on it, you need navigation maps, you need payment integration, you need to find a very simple interface. People actually say, “I want to go from A to B, I want to be safe, I want to be fast, I’m not paying a lot of money, I want to do it with friends, I have luggage that I have to take.”', 'With this little information, it should give you very simple instruction, and say, Here’s your vehicle, this is what you’re going to do first, second, third. And then very hopefully, very simply, you’re going to get from A to B, and you’re going to enjoy it.', 'Simon London: It reminds me a little bit of the way information-technology people like to talk about the stack. And it sounds like there’s a mobility stack here, all the way from the hard infrastructure at bottom, right up through to a user-interface layer at the very top. And the trick for a CEO is to think about, well, Where do we want to play? Where do we play there, on which of the bits of that stack that we want to be in?', 'Stefan Knupfer: I think that’s exactly right. Also you have to understand the interfaces. Even if you play in one, you need to find a way that you actually add value to the entire system. That’s exactly, I believe, why we need a strategy, and we need to have the different players coming together.', 'What you see right now, most of the players, at this point, they offer a product or a service, but they’re not offering solutions. We need them working together to offer solutions. That’s the way to get to seamless mobility.', 'Simon London: OK. So I think that’s all we have time for. But Swarna and Stefan, thanks so much for joining.', 'Stefan Knupfer: Simon, thank you so much. It was a lot of fun.', 'Swarna Ramanathan: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And thanks as always to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

67,Why you should apply analytics to your people strategy,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-you-should-apply-analytics-to-your-people-strategy,Bringing advanced computing power and analytics capabilities to bear on people decisions in an organization is crucial to driving lasting and effective change.,"['Bringing advanced computing power and analytics capabilities to bear on people decisions in an organization is crucial to driving lasting and effective change.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey partner Bryan Hancock and senior partner Bill Schaninger about why people analytics matters even more in a world awash with data and more advanced computing and analytics capabilities.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. A certain breed of executive has always looked down on the people side of management. They see it as soft, squishy, and lacking in hard data. But while that may have been somewhat true 20 or 30 years ago, it certainly isn’t true today. There really is a revolution in progress as companies start to apply big data and advanced analytics to the human side of the enterprise. To talk about the promise and pitfalls of people analytics, I sat down in Philadelphia with McKinsey partners Bryan Hancock and Bill Schaninger. As we’ll hear, Bryan and Bill are optimistic, with the caveat that getting real value from people analytics requires not only technical smarts but also a solid understanding of organizational behavior and a pretty good grasp on how the business actually makes money.', 'So Bryan and Bill, welcome back to the podcast.', 'Bryan Hancock: Thank you.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thanks for having us.', 'Simon London: So an obvious first question for a nonspecialist is: When we’re talking about people analytics, what are we talking about?', 'Bryan Hancock: What we’re talking about is bringing data on people to specific business decisions. It can be a decision to hire. It can be a decision on how to configure a team. It can be a decision on where to source people. But it is bringing a data set to people decisions. It’s as simple as that.', 'People analytics has existed as a concept for a long time. It’s not that there’s anything radical about the idea of people analytics. What’s cool is that now there are new sources of data and advanced computing powers that allow you to do more with the data. But the underlying idea of using data to inform people-related business decisions is not necessarily a new thing.', 'Bill Schaninger: We make decisions every day about who we hire, how we deploy them, what teams we put them in, what we have them working on. Then we sit in judgment of their performances. Every one of those decisions can be made better with data. Not all those decisions are equally important, so you don’t have to bring it to bear in all of them, but you should probably bring it to bear more than we are doing today.', 'Simon London: As you say, it’s not an entirely new idea. But what’s the opportunity today? What makes this a particularly important and interesting topic?', 'Bryan Hancock: I think what makes it a particularly interesting and exciting topic today is a combination of a few factors.', 'One, there really are new advanced computing capabilities that allow you to factor in more variables and determine more of what really matters. Of course, you can’t just do that independently. It has to be linked to good research in what matters, but the advanced computing power does matter.', 'There are new and different sources of the data—super exciting and interesting. Those matter.', 'Also, there is the acceptance, more broadly, of advanced analytics—be it from marketing to sports. That is making people think, “Oh, if I can do this in understanding my consumer or understanding the quality of my first baseman, why can’t I do this for understanding what makes a good salesperson tick?”', 'Simon London: Talk a little bit about the sources and the categories of data. What kind of data are we talking about here?', 'Bill Schaninger: There are some interesting pools that I think, in many cases, we hadn’t really connected. Maybe it’s just because we were isolating around the individual employee in a way that wasn’t helpful. So there’s the obvious. There’s the information about the employee: where they went to school, and where they’ve worked. That’s basic.', 'But then you can also get into things about their attributes, their traits, their personalities. And then you think, “OK, well, what other data do we have?” We can collect data about performance. We can also collect data about the environments they’re in: perceptions of the boss, the boss’s effectiveness, what they’re working on, who they’re working on it with, how long they’re working, the company overall, competitive positioning, location.', 'Historically we wouldn’t have always brought those together. But as soon as we say, “We really want to understand the person, the environment the person’s working in, who they’re working with and how that’s going,” it’s way more natural to bring that together. And you can start showing the longitudinal effects.', 'Simon London: And then, presumably, perceptions as well: That’s another bucket of data?', 'Bill Schaninger: For sure. Most data around the organization—its effectiveness, its climate—is perception based. A good rule of thumb about this is if you’re about to make a choice about a person, you can probably do it better with some data. It is really that simple. Basic things like, Who should we hire? Where should we go to recruit? Who should we put together on a team? What should that team work on? How well are they performing? Why are there differences between units in performance?', 'We have a couple of things coming together at once. Of your two capitals, we are long on financial capital, and we are short on human capital. So now every decision you make about people matters more. We’re at an era where computing power and analytic techniques have allowed us to do more than we could in the past.', 'In particular—in “stat speak”—you would swap the models really quickly. You could only test so many interaction terms. When they talk about machine learning and the advances in nonparametric statistics, basically, what they’ve done is said, “We’re going to ignore the rules of parametric statistics. We won’t assume everything’s normal. And we’re going to run many, many more combinations than previously possible to find unique segments of people.”', 'Simon London: From what we see today, how many companies are actually doing this at scale? How many companies have really adopted people analytics in a way that is really having an impact?', 'Bryan Hancock: There’s a spectrum of what people analytics can be and do. The majority of companies, the vast majority, are doing basic reporting-type analytics: Who’s turning over? Where are they turning over? They’re doing some initial root-cause problem solving as to what’s behind it. Most companies are doing assessments of folks who are coming in to see if they’re a good fit for the role.', 'The question is, how many companies are going beyond that basic reporting, basic analytics, to using some of the bigger data sets, to using advanced computing power, and combining those data sets with well-proven academic theory on what really drives performance in an organization? How many organizations are using that at the next frontier? Very, very few.', 'Bill Schaninger: Three years ago, when we first started talking about this and started investing in it heavily, the basic question was, Who’s about to leave? It was about retention. That was the earliest use case across the board. That was pretty straightforward, because you were predicting a one or a zero.', 'As the people who’ve bought into this have migrated toward answering business problems and considering the impact of people and the combination of people on business problems, the use cases have gotten better and more impactful. But that list is probably still pretty small. We’re still running into some similar roadblocks, if you will. There is a belief set, convenient or not, that “we don’t have enough data.”', 'This is not true. Whatever data you have, you can start with. And, particularly now that you don’t need a data lake, you need an ecosystem of data, that’s a real “unlock.” You can get at it. Acknowledge that the outside world probably already has better data on your employees than you do. Just go use it. It’s there. They’ve given it to other sites. Go get at it.', 'Bryan Hancock: Some of the data is quite public. Many professionals post their résumés and professional backgrounds on LinkedIn. By understanding, in aggregate, tens of thousands of LinkedIn profiles—and patterns among them, including which types of talent aggregate and which functions and which companies—it becomes possible to compare, for example, Amazon versus Target and really look at where their merchants came from and what their backgrounds are.', 'Another one of my favorite things to do anytime a client is talking about my employee experience is to note that there is a wealth of information, be it on Glassdoor, or professional-service firms’ sites, or Vault, or Above the Law for a law-firm context. You can go “outside in” to not just get an understanding of “hey, Above the Law gave you a C+ and gave somebody else an A–” but also look at all of the qualitative comments. And you can structure those together and understand, in a fact-based way, what the themes are at your law firm, accounting firm, tech start-up. And you can understand how those themes compare with others. This can highlight real gaps in certain leadership behaviors and other management behaviors and practices.', 'Bill Schaninger: And then—Bryan just hinted at this—maybe acknowledge that, for the better part of 60 years, some really good psychologists have written theory and done all the initial testing and validation on what good science looks like when it comes to people. We’ve just basically ignored it.', 'There was a great article written in the late ’90s—when I was getting my PhD, so I read journal articles then—and they were looking at the correlation between the most valid tools for selection and frequency of use. And they were inversely correlated. In plain language, the best tools weren’t being used. The worst tools, like the unstructured interview, were being used all the time.', 'That’s because we’ve done two things. We’ve grown five generations of managers who know “it” when they see it, and they’re sure they know. They’re, of course, wrong, but they’re sure they know. On the flip side, we have systematically devalued, underfunded, and eviscerated most HR functions. So many HR teams aren’t capable of doing people analytics, even if we wanted them to.', 'In the past, you might have expected HR personnel to serve more as custodians, running the bureaucracy. Now you see these three legs that really matter. One, they actually need to know how the business makes money. Otherwise you can’t pick the use cases that matter. Two, they need to understand the science behind talent. Whether it’s industrial-organizational psychology, or management, or HR, there is a science—again, as I was saying, 60 years on—about what works and what doesn’t. Then there’s the quant part—and this part has become emergent—which is, you don’t have to be a statistician, but you do need to know enough to be a good consumer of statistics. In that case, we’re finding many of these departments lacking. Or they’ve set the group up separately, and there is no actual translation.', 'So who alone can handle understanding how we make money and what stats we should deploy, based on existing and prevailing theory that we know is right? When you get that right, you get good problems brought to the fore and answered. When you don’t, you’re answering questions no one cares about.', 'Bryan Hancock: There are two forces outside of HR that are helping HR make the case for analytics.', 'One is what’s been happening in the marketing department. As marketing has used more and more advanced analytics to get deeper and deeper views of consumers and consumer behavior and more predictive tools and analytics, folks in HR can now say, “Shouldn’t we have the same level of fact bases on our employees as we do on our customers?”', 'And, in fact, many HR departments, when building a people-analytics capability and looking for that analytic capability, are tapping into the marketing function and tapping into people who are using the analytics in a different way. After all, figuring out why somebody chose an employer isn’t all that different a scientific exercise as figuring out why they chose your product over a competitor’s product.', 'The second thing that is useful is sports—in particular, baseball. Rarely do I get into a people-analytics conversation, even with non-sports lovers, where the head of HR doesn’t say, “Hey, you know what? What we really need here is … ”', 'Simon London: Moneyball.', 'Bryan Hancock: “… Moneyball.” Exactly. We’re talking about wins above replacement. Now the baseball analogy gets deeper and deeper, because people say, “Hey, it’s not just wins above replacement”—which is an individual metric—“but it’s also about how we shift the defense on the field”—which is a team metric. So now HR leaders are empowered with analogies that are familiar to everybody. It’s not this scary Big Brother people analytics. No, no. It’s what the Houston Astros are doing. What we’re talking about here is not just fielding the best people on the team but also figuring out how to align them in the right way.', 'Simon London: Something that strikes me, particularly as you talk about baseball, is there’s probably enough data out there, and there’s probably a good sense of what makes individual players successful and what makes teams successful. When you go and talk to companies, do they know what makes their people successful or what makes their teams successful? Or is that the first thing that you need to align upon?', 'Bill Schaninger: Believe it or not, before you can talk about what makes the individual successful, you have to be able to answer the question, “For what job?” What’s the job to be done? What matters? Many individuals who are in roles now have gone through periods of restructuring, job enlargement, job enhancement, or massive shift in role relative to what they were hired for. We tend to fall in love with incumbency. Get a client to talk about a role, and within 45 seconds, they will be using a name. They get hooked in on a person.', 'That role mutates over time, but if you were being clinical about it, you would take a pause and say, “What is this role contributing in terms of value? How important is it, and what are the jobs to be done?” As soon as you can get to jobs to be done, then you can go old school, like the John Vorises of the world, who did this for the government and said, “This is what job analysis really looks like.” There’s a description of what has to happen, and there’s a spec on what the perfect candidate is. And that switch over to this is saying, “What do they need to know? What do they have to be able to do? What attributes really matter? What experiences would we look to for comfort?”', 'We’re dealing with many clients that have had proliferation of roles over time. Too many job titles. Too many roles. And they might have too many people to invest in the kind of detail that we’re talking about. Sometimes it’s best just to get the small number of roles that matter way more than others and prove it there—in the 25, 50 roles that account for 60 percent of the value of the company in the next five years. Just get your head around that, and then you can go to brass tacks. What do they have to do? What are the knowledge, skills, and attributes they need? Then you can turn to well-worn tools.', 'Simon London: So maybe this is where the sports analogy breaks down for many organizations. When you’re looking at a sports team, there are only a limited number of roles. Now, in an organization, if you’ve got 100,000 people doing one role, well, fine, you can look at that. But if you’ve got 1,000 roles with 100 people doing each of them, where do you begin? What drives success in each of those is a much more complicated problem. Is that a good way to think about it?', 'Bryan Hancock: That’s absolutely a good way to think about it. We would think that, in any given organization, there are 30 to 50 individual roles that are worth understanding at a granular level because they drive a disproportionate amount of value for the business, whether it’s the current-momentum value of the existing business or value for driving growth. It’s a relatively small number, 30 to 50. In addition, there are probably eight to ten broad skill pools. Sales might be one example of a broad skill pool. Of those folks, there may be 20,000 in a given organization, but you can understand and come up with the archetype there.', 'The sales one is most exciting to me because a lot of the people-analytics folks look at it and say, “Well, that’s really interesting, but how much of a difference did that make?” And I can say, “Give me half of your sales organization. Give me the existing data you have. Let me get one or two new pieces of insight, but not more than one or two, and I can raise your sales 3 to 5 percent.” If I don’t, no harm, no foul. Thank you for your time. But I’m convinced that analytics in sales is one of the things that every organization should be doing because it rings the cash register in such an obvious way and is one that can have such clear comparison sets.', 'Simon London: And it’s clear what success looks like, which is improved sales. Whereas in many roles, coming to a common understanding of what success looks like and then what drives success, I’d imagine, is a lot more complex.', 'Bill Schaninger: It is harder. In fact, we’ve seen one of the interesting challenges is around performance management and a sense of who’s actually successful. How do we know how well they’re doing? When you can count widgets sold or airplane engines sold, you get it. You can look at margin and things like that. But for these more complicated roles, you say, “Well, who’s good?” You get some really squishy answers because you’ll ask, “Why are they good?”', 'We’ve turned on something in the last couple years called imputed performance, where we accept that most performance-appraisal ratings are useless—not because ratings are bad, but because everyone is a four out of a five. You’re living in Lake Wobegon. And you’re just asking and getting answered questions like, What would be great here? Is greatness exceeding the budgeted number or the way you set a stretch target—so the goal is to hit that number? Is it getting people promoted? Is it turning on new internet protocol? Is it conversion within your existing client base? What are the seven to eight things that really matter? Then they are weighted. Now you have a new number. But what you also have is differentiation. The science behind being able to predict people is you need variability. As one of the people I studied under used to say, “Variance is your friend because you can explain variance. And as soon as you can explain variance among people, you know what matters and what doesn’t.”', 'Simon London: Another new source of data is a sociometric badge. Now, as an employee, that makes my skin crawl a little bit. I’m not sure I want to be asked to wear a sociometric badge. Just talk a little bit about what these badges actually do. What do they collect? What don’t they collect? And if you’re going to use them as an employer, how do you go about that?', 'Bryan Hancock: They have the most power as diagnostic tools, as ways of understanding what the patterns of human interaction between employees and a given environment are. I don’t think using such badges is a great thing to do as an ongoing management tool.', 'For example, “Did you realize that Bill spent a total of 30 minutes in the washroom today? That is up five minutes from his washroom visit before and deviates from the average by x percent.” That’s not how it should be used. But where it can be incredibly powerful is understanding, for example, if you’re in a quick-service restaurant, how much are employees talking to customers versus talking to colleagues? Which colleagues are they talking to? Is it mainly the manager?', 'Bill Schaninger: Front line, the dyad of the boss and the employee: again, in 60 years of research, there is no more important relationship at work, period. How can you understand what we’ve asked people to do versus what needs to happen? Then it’s backed up by data, not by someone going, “Oh, I know how it should be.”', 'A brief derivative on this because this client was interesting. It had hired a head of operations from another chain, and its entire model was built around speed of service—including how they staffed and where they put people. The minute we tried to draw the link to customer satisfaction, it wasn’t there. I think it was zero. Because once somebody came inside the restaurant, were they that concerned about speed? No. They wanted an accurate order. And they’d like it to taste good. That was it. Then we started looking at the company and saying, “Actually, everything it’s gearing for is ‘get it out, get it out, get it out.’”', 'Simon London: So it was optimizing for the wrong outcome.', 'Bill Schaninger: Completely the wrong thing. The manager had a weird mix of “administrivia,” bureaucracy, and pushing for speed as opposed to getting it right. That had a huge impact on the stores.', 'Simon London: As an employee, trying to take that lens, I get more comfortable, as you said, because it’s diagnostic. I’m not being asked to wear the badge, and I’m not under supervision constantly. It’s for a set period to help me understand how I work and whether I’m working in the best way—then I get more comfortable.', 'Bryan Hancock: It’s the pharma equivalent of a black-label drug. I think a lot of these need a warning before they get put in the organization in the wrong hands because there is an incredible power of these tools to really create a soul-sapping level of transparency into what you do. That can lead to a soul-sapping questioning of every decision you made over every part of your day that can really create a dystopian workplace.', 'If you introduce these tools in an environment where people say, “OK, here are the risks, here are the downsides; let’s make sure that the business leaders who may have instincts to go in the risk direction don’t, because it has these negative effects; and let’s make sure we’re focused on diagnosing the right interactions, reinforcing the right things,” there’s an unlimited potential.', 'Simon London: Can we talk a little bit about data privacy? Because, presumably, one of the other dangers here, if these programs are done badly, is you can trip up quite a lot of legal requirements—GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and other things—around what you can and can’t do with personal data. Presumably, this is not just an HR-plus-data-wonk exercise. There needs to be some legal-governance framework around this as you’re putting these programs together.', 'Bryan Hancock: Yes. I’m a lawyer by training, so I get into all the exciting nitty-gritty with the legal teams. Both from the privacy standpoint and from the employment-law standpoint, you want to be very careful of how you’re protecting the data and how you’re making sure that your data is being used to make fair and equitable decisions on people. To the extent that you create something that doesn’t have data privacy or is not fair and equitable, you’ve introduced a tremendous amount of legal risk to the organization.', 'What we find very helpful is going back to the first principle of why we are worried about this data. We’re worried about it from the individual protections. That means that it can’t cross these country boundaries. That means that we don’t collect it on servers, and we deal at an aggregate level. Those are very practical things we can solve to address privacy concerns and where it moves.', 'But often those concerns deal with things in the aggregate versus the specific managerial interactions that let you do what you want to get done. There is a real concern that if somebody comes up with a correlation—even with the best intent—that demonstrates adverse impact, the company will start to act on it. That introduces a lot of risk if there’s not a real solid basis for the data.', 'Bill Schaninger: If the model that you’re building to predict something—who should be hired, who might leave, or whatever it is—if it’s faulty, it doesn’t matter what the math says, because the model’s wrong. Remember, we went all the way back to an understanding of the science.', 'If I came to you and said, “I have found the most amazing correlation, ice-cream sales and asphalt sales are unbelievably correlated. It’s astonishing.” So it must mean that when people are pitching new roads, they go out and buy ice cream. Or temperature might be important.', 'If it’s not modeled, it’s not there. So there is a danger. This is why you need to kick the tires on the model. We’re even aggressive with our own data-science folks. Being aboveboard with data, we ought to be able to show every employee every bit of data we’ve collected and why and how long it will be kept and what it’s used for.', 'Bryan Hancock: I’ll give you another really interesting source of external data. We were working with an oil driller, trying to understand how it could attract more people to its drilling operation. For oil drillers, the number-one constraint to growth is finding enough people to operate the machinery. It’s a super-tight labor market. What makes the difference in the oil patch between growth and not growth is, Do you have the people? The CEO of our client came with a question of, “How do I get more people to work in my drilling operation versus my competitors’?”', 'His hypothesis was two things. One, “We have to pay them more. It’s a tight labor market. We need to pay significantly more than our competitors to attract people.” The second was, in the camps where the workers reside, the company would cater a steak dinner once a week as a thank you. If it was known for having the best food and for having the best pay, it would disproportionately attract folks. We said, “Let’s test it.”', 'The questions the CEO had were, “How are you going to test this? These folks don’t really have good internet access in the camps. How are you going to get a competitor’s perspective, anyway? You could only get our people. They’re not necessarily on LinkedIn. How are you going to find these folks?” And I said, “Where do they hang out?”', 'We ended up going to the various bars, other dining establishments, in Williston, North Dakota, and other places in the oil patch to find folks who worked for our client and the ones who worked for its competitors. We gave them a little bit of compensation for their time and asked them a set of traditional, well-proven marketing-survey questions.', 'What came out of the analysis was we were able to get not just insight into our client and the main competitors, but we also got an understanding of the whole market. Because as soon as somebody heard, “Hey, they’re paying for a little bit of your time if you just go down to the bar,” they would come. We got this really rich data set. Then since we had this nontraditional source of data, we were able to run analytics on it.', 'What mattered most was not pay or the steak dinner. Pay had to be in the range of the competitors. But differential pay wouldn’t necessarily get more folks. The number-one factor was safety. Are people going to make it home? Are they going to make it home in one piece? And folks wanted to work for the drillers that had the best safety reputation. What about our client? Our client was one of the safest if you looked at all the objective metrics. But it wasn’t perceived as such. By working on some of that perception, it was able to move the needle in a way that pay wouldn’t.', 'And by the way, what about the steak dinner? As it turned out, when we probed workers on whether they’d want this bundle or this bundle, folks didn’t want the steak dinner as much as they wanted a larger freezer in the camps so they could bring more of their own food from home.', 'Simon London: Interesting. What’s fascinating about that one is when we talk about people analytics, I think there is a temptation to think it’s all very automated, that it’s all about big data sets that you’re pulling in from big systems. That’s a classic example of something very creative, going to the source, getting the data that you need through quite traditional methods. But it’s data. And it’s good data.', 'Bryan Hancock: Absolutely. It’s amazing in the tech industry what you can learn in parking lots in Silicon Valley and other places. The oil-field labor market has a very niche set of skills. We had to go to where the people were working. For other skill sets, there’s no reason why you can’t apply similarly creative methods to understand them more deeply.', 'Simon London: So as you mentioned, we’re in a very tight labor market, certainly here in the US at this point in time. How does people analytics help organizations address that?', 'Bill Schaninger: We’ve spent a lot of time talking about selection and who you pick. But upstream from that, it’s sourcing. Where do you go to look for them? Who do you try to attract? Who do you get into the recruiting funnel before you even get to selection?', 'We had a client that we were serving, and it was facing a lot of cross-offers. It was going to the usual suspects. Those candidates are all incredibly skilled. They’re going to have offers from the high-end consulting firms, from the investment banks, et cetera.', 'So the client said, “Where else can we go?” The first instinct was “let’s just keep going to the same places. Let’s just offer a whole lot more money or come up with new approaches to working.” And we said, “OK. Well, you could. But you know you could go look in other places.”', 'Some of it is a willingness to break through the idea that it has to be that school. How do you get comfortable breaking through that? Now the client, still interested in testing this out, said, “Let’s go look at the people who’ve been successful in your organization.” Do they all have an Ivy League education? The answer is no. By the way—and this is not a knock on the Ivies—but in the client’s situation, the best-performing managers tended to come from a Patriot League school.  They also had the personality attributes of a little bit of edge and a little bit of a chip on their shoulders. They are smart enough but with some real desire to perform and show people. That happened to work well in that environment.', 'What’s the takeaway from that? You can measure all of that. That’s all available to you. You don’t even have to give a test for that.', 'Simon London: The interesting thing about that case is that, again, you’re not talking necessarily about big data, machine learning. You can figure out who the successful people were at your organization with small data.', 'Bill Schaninger: Absolutely right.', 'Simon London: But it’s the application of a fact base and analytics to people decisions rather than the nostrums, the gut feel, the idea of, “we’ll just carry on doing what we’ve always done.”', 'Bill Schaninger: In fact, in selection research, there’s something called “biodata,” or markers of something in the person’s life that gives you an indication of who they might be as a person. If you wanted someone who was entrepreneurial, a good thing to look for is, Did they own a paper route? Did they grow it three years successively? If you’re looking for resilience, people who come from divorced households tend to have a little bit more of it—and then proceeded to not see a drop in school performance during that period of time.', 'Simon London: How much of this is culturally specific when you work on these issues globally? Do you need fundamentally different data sets from different countries? Is that something that we come across?', 'Bryan Hancock: The approaches are similar across geographies. You have to put the work you’re doing in the right cultural context. And the cultural context could vary based on expected interactions between managers and subordinates. Cultural interactions could also be about data expectations, pay expectations. There are a number of things that vary by context.', 'But the underlying science, I think, does apply across. The ability to apply facts and data to make specific people decisions, I do think that that’s applicable across cultural contexts. We’ve seen this work in Asia. We’ve seen it work in Latin America, Western Europe, and the US. We do see applicability of people analytics broadly.', 'Bill Schaninger: The extent to which you’re predicting an environment where you’re trying to understand what about the environment drives performance—that, I think, you have to be a little bit more sensitive to, and to what’s possible.', 'We were doing work with an engineering company once, looking at the right composition of engineering teams. It had been operating during that time but, basically, running 24/7. You’d follow the sun. When the company went and pushed on it, it was not about countries not working well together. It was not, “The engineering center in India doesn’t work well with the engineering center in California.”', 'The bigger issue was time zones. When you had more than three time zones, it broke down. But in understanding the person, the benefit of industrial-organizational psychology, the constructs around personality, the definition of general mental ability: those things are well known and well validated.', 'Simon London: So we’re out of time today. But thank you very much Bryan Hancock and Bill Schaninger for a fascinating discussion.', 'Bryan Hancock: Thank you. Enjoyed it.', 'Bill Schaninger: Thanks for having us.', 'Simon London: And thanks as ever to you, our listeners, for tuning into this episode of the McKinsey Podcast.

68,Preparing for and managing through a downturn,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/preparing-for-and-managing-through-a-downturn,"As talk of an impending economic downturn takes hold in the business world, executives can take thoughtful steps to help their companies better weather the storm.","['As talk of an impending economic downturn takes hold in the business world, executives can take thoughtful steps to help their companies better weather the storm.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey Quarterly executive editor Tim Dickson speaks with senior partner Sven Smit about how companies can be more resilient in the face of an impending economic downturn.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be talking about the next recession. When will it come? How will it come? And importantly, what do we know about managing through a downturn? While we can’t predict the future, we can learn lessons from history: how successful companies have positioned themselves going into a recession and the actions they take during and after the downswing. To talk about all of this, my McKinsey Publishing colleague Tim Dickson caught up in Amsterdam with Sven Smit. Sven is a McKinsey senior partner. He works on strategy across a range of industries and has helped clients navigate the twists and turns of the business cycle. Without further ado, over to Tim.', 'Tim Dickson: Let’s start with the likelihood of a downturn. What do you think are the chances of a full-blown recession this year?', 'Sven Smit: Well, clearly, Tim, people are talking a lot about it, and there’s more volatility in some of the broad measures that you could look at. The one thing I will say is that people who say you can predict when it’s going to happen are essentially not truthful because the evidence shows that there are no good predictors. In hindsight, there are some people that said they timed it [the last time].', 'But I would say you should be very careful about making a prediction. Of course, you should listen to all the different pathways by which people are saying something might happen, because that ups your readiness. And yes, you could say it’s been a long time. So winter will come, and after that, summer will come again. But when winter will come is deeply unpredictable.', 'Tim Dickson: What are the things that people should be looking for? What’s most likely to precipitate a downturn, in your view?', 'Sven Smit: The pathway of uncertainty and downturns is also very often surprising. So here, again, you could look at a collection of things that might be, and then think there will still be one that’s surprising. I could imagine that we’re going through a very large experiment in monetary policy with quantitative easing that we’re partially unwinding. We’re changing interest rates. How does that work through?', 'Where will the next bubble sit? Is it a housing market? Is it tech? People will say that the trade stuff that’s happening might have an effect, and yes, that might have an effect. It might be that leverage at the moment is high in certain places, which might then mean that’s tight. And people have been raising a series of pathways, and one of them will—or many of them will, one way or the other—touch this.', 'Tim Dickson: A lot of people’s benchmark, of course, is the recession of 2008–09. I wonder if you could say how broadly you think the next downturn will be different from that one?', 'Sven Smit: I would say you can almost with certainty say it’s different, because I can’t recall similar recessions in my 28 years in business.', 'Tim Dickson: Each one is different?', 'Sven Smit: They’re all different. And they have different reactions. They hit different sectors. The financial system is always involved somehow. But global downturns start in different places. Some started geographically in Asia. Some started in the bond market. Some started in a mismatch in inflation. And interest pricing. So there are so many places where different recessions have started. The one thing that I feel fairly comfortable saying is this one will be different.', 'Tim Dickson: With all these uncertainties, at this particular point, at the beginning of 2019, are there some no-regrets moves, things that companies and chief executives can do at this stage before we know how it’s going to play out?', 'Sven Smit: The simple answer is the healthier your business is today, tomorrow, and the next quarter, the more resilient you will be in a downturn, in the sense that if your costs are lower, you have more buffer to take on stuff. If your balance sheet is not so leveraged, the more capacity you have to take things on and the more capacity you have to invest. That’s one thing.', 'The second thing is you could at least have some of the prework done; if not already, work it to say, what is the destination investment post crisis or post recession? And have the majority of your investment in that area so that you have good stuff that will be there and accelerate at the moment it moves out.', 'Tim Dickson: Once a downturn starts, we know from new McKinsey research that the fortunes of major companies varied last time. In particular, a group of resilient organizations dipped less in the downturn and widened their lead in the recovery. What, broadly, did those companies do differently than the rest?', 'Sven Smit: We found that there were 13 percent of companies that were more resilient. They had real outperformance and total returns to shareholders. Then we looked at what these companies did. They really were already moving a little bit ahead, but only ever so slightly, prerecession. They were already doing some good things. But they created a significant gap through the recovery, and then doubled that gap, or more, post recovery.', 'When you looked at the revenue profiles of the resilient and non-resilient companies, they were not that different. It is really on the margin side that you see that, way earlier, they showed improvements in margin during the downturn. So during the downturn you literally have the margins improving. The improvement rate dips a little bit, but it’s still going up—while the margin in profile of the non-resilient companies is going down during the downturn, and only one year after, starts to go up. That comes from far more proactive operating cost cutting, which the nonresilient companies postponed to post crisis. The resilient companies also worked hard at leverage, in particular through divestments. They got into a much better cash position that also allowed them to then invest in the future path. That was quite substantial.', 'Tim Dickson: A lot of this is going to require cost cutting, and CEOs are going to be told to cut costs, and there will be lots of advice about how to cut costs. Can you talk about that?', 'Sven Smit: If you look at cost cutting, there are a few buckets. One is fundamentally improving productivity, which is almost no regrets, and you want to keep on doing that, and invest against it, because that productivity is always going to be good because it means you produce the same outcome with less effort. All that makes total sense to continue to do.', 'You could have some postponement of investment because you have some uncertainty. But the real issue is not so much the postponing; it’s are you ratcheting it back up fast enough when the recession is done? Often what happens is that people ratchet down, and then they wait too long to bring it back up. That’s where the nuance hits. Postponing is a good way to think about it because when the sky falls from the heavens, and that’s the feeling, I would also pull almost all brakes. But once you know the sky didn’t fall from the heavens, you should put the gas back on. Putting the gas back on is a hard thing.', 'Then I’ve seen some companies that had, I would say, very good alignment with local and national governments on how to support the labor situation in the downturn. For the government, it’s not great that everybody just gets into the streets. But at the same time, the companies can’t handle all the costs anymore. I’ve seen people who knew that the upturn would be good for them find a solution with governments, to say, you pay half, I pay half, and as a result, the people were not released, but the people were protected one way or the other.', 'Tim Dickson: It sounds, from what you say, as though CEOs should be mindful about the social consequences of the actions they take in a forthcoming recession.', 'Sven Smit: We are not living in a Milton Friedman–esque system where if you don’t have demand, you just fire the people and the market will solve what happens to the people. The demand of society to run a business and a government or institutions in a responsible way is only heightened. I think the current tensions that you see in politics are an expression of that in many ways.', 'I would always consider how you’re dealing with the knock-on effects, how the multitude of stakeholders are part of your journey. This will be different by geography, in terms of the intensity by which this is needed. But it’s also because businesses and institutions have responsibility to people. So it is not only for a downturn. For example, in the advent of digital, many, many companies are retraining their people for future jobs. That might be one way to think about it, is some of the jobs that will be released will be old jobs. That will go a little faster. But you would help these people have the capability for the new jobs, and that might be one way to address the responsibility, is to work on the retraining of the workforce so that what you have is at least a decision to take the people into the future.', 'Tim Dickson: Nevertheless, there’s the saying, “Don’t let a good crisis go to waste.” I’m sure a lot of CEOs will be mindful of that. Can you think of some examples of what people should be doing following that mantra?', 'Sven Smit: The best examples are the people who have continued to invest. They continue to invest in pockets of demand that you know are there, whether it’s new energy technologies, new technologies in manufacturing, new semiconductor technologies that you know for which demand will exist. Continued miniaturization of electronics is something for which there is infinite demand. It might just be cyclically gone for a while. It doesn’t make sense to stop the investment in that ongoing research, for example. So one lens is investment.', 'The second one is seize opportunity. If some other player moves a little oddly in reaction, that’s a time for you to snatch assets, snatch people, and take a proactive stance, which is that a crisis is truly an opportunity.', 'The other part is you can leverage the mind-set in a company a little bit when a downturn hits. Some things that were frozen organizationally, socially in an organization, you can then get moving because you can use the pressure to get some boxes to move that were frozen.', 'Tim Dickson: One of the issues that people think about is M&A, obviously, when the recovery comes. But it’s not enough to wait until the recovery comes when thinking about the whole divestiture and acquisition program. Companies need, presumably, to start now. What principles should they bear in mind when thinking about M&A?', 'Sven Smit: On M&A, there is not that much evidence that people are good at timing. Philosophically, there are people who say, “I have a strategy by which I know what I would want to buy and sell, and I am going to try to time it.” And you have other companies that say, “I buy whatever at that point in market prices, and sometimes I buy high and sometimes I buy low, but I never let something go that’s available.”', 'The evidence is not that strong that one or the other is better. I could make an argument that the second one, which is a bit more consistent, has the advantage that you’re building a constant capability of integrating. But clearly, there will be particular opportunities that unfreeze in an M&A market because of a downturn. An asset that you’ve been waiting for for 20 years might just have been knocked one way or the other, and that makes it available. Of course, you’re not doing this because it’s cheap, but because it has become available.', 'Tim Dickson: Can we just switch back to the whole digital-disruption context? Digital is already dividing winners and losers, and I imagine an economic recession is going to exacerbate that even more. How do you see that playing out?', 'Sven Smit: If you take some sectors that are sensitive to aggregate demand, like retail, which is under significant pressure from online players—they of course are themselves also players online. The switch to online might suddenly get a lot bigger. If you have a business that is challenged by online, and then you get a demand drop, you will have a double drop. And in these areas, I think they will be more exposed. The parts of a business that are sliding because of the digital disruption, they will slide faster. You might expose some things that you don’t see now, because of that additional drop. And so the profit sensitivity might be very big on that side. On the upside, I would say this is a place to continue to invest. The future will include digital. The future will include the online. The differentiating move is to up it in the downturn.', 'Tim Dickson: As you go around talking to corporate leaders, what are people saying to you? What actions are people taking, particularly executives who perhaps don’t have long memories, who weren’t there last time?', 'Sven Smit: I see that most executives are sensitizing their organizations to the idea that something might come, and play through some scenarios, what would we do then to have some heightened readiness and awareness, so that you don’t have to invent the playbook? There are some that don’t do that. But I think it’s very prudent, like some of these executives that I talk to, is to have a playbook for what you do if a downturn happens, with some scenarios on how it might happen, and say, “OK, this is the script that we’re going to work off of. We will modify it based on what really happens.” That playbook is an important point.', 'One of the things that I’ve learned in either single-company events or these larger recessions where many companies and institutions got under pressure is just how hard a test that is for leaders. If you look at it, the last one was eight years ago. Most CEOs maybe were there when it happened, but they were not CEO. And it is different to be the CEO and trying to figure out what to do in a crisis than to see what the CEO is doing. You don’t know whether your leadership can hold up in a tough time. It’s interesting that in our people systems, in thinking about who is a good leader or not, it’s not a structured item, often, in the HR systems. But you really want to make sure that you not only have the people in the front that can handle it, hopefully, but also if they can’t handle it, that you have a way to back it up quickly.', 'Tim Dickson: Sven, there’s a lot of wisdom and a lot of advice that you’ve given. If I could ask you just to sum up, perhaps, one overriding piece of advice you would give to a CEO at this stage about what lies ahead?', 'Sven Smit: I think you should do everything possible, when something complicated hits, to stay calibrated. To date, there’s no recession that has lasted—even the big ones—that has lasted longer than one or two years. So good times will come. In the recession, the response is, you go crazy. Cut, cut, cut. Do this, that. And yes, you should be at pace, full on, and all that stuff, but don’t forget that the actions you take toward the future in the recession are as important as the actions that you take to respond to the unique event that will take place. Holding that calibration is very difficult. Profit margins of companies are not that big. So in a recession, it will look very ugly very quickly. Ugly makes you respond with ugly, while the beauty is ahead, or the prosperity is ahead.', 'Finding that balance, and, as a result, finding ways to have reflective time—I would, for example, maybe say every discussion that I will start in a meeting that is about the recession, let’s remind ourselves that we’re dealing with an event. It’s big, bad, and ugly. But we’re also dealing with the future, which is going to be great. That, to me, is—and there are many, many things you can talk about—but that, to me, is the biggest lens that people should hold to themselves.', 'Tim Dickson: The prospect of beauty and happiness ahead, that’s a great, optimistic note to end on. Sven, thanks very much, indeed.', 'Sven Smit: Thank you.', 'Sven Smit is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Amsterdam office.

How did they do it, and what can we learn?', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partner Katy George and partner Enno de Boer about the future of advanced manufacturing technology—think digital and advanced analytics, not robots.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London.The future, they say, is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed. Well, this pretty much sums up the current state of manufacturing. Some factories are indeed moving at pace into the future. They’re combining automation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things [IoT], and more to fundamentally change how they operate. And yet the majority of manufacturers are struggling to deploy these technologies at scale. To understand why, I sat down in New Jersey with McKinsey partners Katy George and Enno de Boer. Enno and Katy are fresh from a joint research effort with the World Economic Forum to track down and understand these “lighthouse” manufacturers, beacons of best practice in the emerging fourth industrial revolution. Katy and Enno, thanks for being here. Welcome to the podcast.', 'Enno de Boer: Very happy to be here.', 'Katy George: Excellent to be here. Thanks for having us.', 'Simon London: Enno, you’ve just come back from a little bit of a world tour looking at some of these manufacturing plants. When I think about the future of manufacturing, I’m imagining big greenfield operations, lots of robots, not many people. Is that broadly what you find?', 'Enno de Boer:  Actually, it’s the opposite. We see that in this industrial revolution, you can build on the existing equipment you have. It’s mainly brownfield situations. Look at one of our lighthouses 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             The term describes facilities so advanced in their use of digital technology, automation, analytics—and robots—that they stand out among their industry peers.\\r               \\r \\r —the Procter & Gamble Rakona plant. That’s a site that has been there since 1875.', 'Simon London: So not greenfield at all. That’s about as brownfield as you can get.', 'Enno de Boer: Well, you can do a greenfield, and you can use the technology in greenfield, but it’s very much applicable to brownfield. Sensoring has become so affordable that you can sensor out all the factories with existing equipment and then put the data to work.', 'Katy George: What I think is very exciting is not only can you think about utilizing existing assets in a new way—but that goes for the workforce as well. How can we utilize an existing workforce and upskill or reskill them to be successful in the new technologies? As Enno said, what we’re seeing around the world is that some of the most advanced Industry 4.0 plants not only are using brownfield assets but they’re also using their same workforce. The people are learning new skills and working in a new way.', 'Simon London: OK. So my preconceptions have been thoroughly shattered. We’re not talking about big greenfield robotic operations. When you do go into these plants, what are the technologies in play?', 'Enno de Boer: Let me start with the best-known example: predictive maintenance. That’s one use case. There you already see how many technologies come together to innovate the way we do maintenance in the future. And the future is now.', 'First, you have sensors on machines. They create signals, and IoT connects those into a data lake. Machine-learning algorithms help to dig through all the data and digest it and make meaning out of it. That’s the intelligence part.', 'Now we’re putting automation in place. This automation is scheduling the maintenance job, and it’s ordering all the spare parts that the maintenance engineer needs to do his or her job. The maintenance engineer arrives at the site, has an AR [augmented reality] headset, and gets instructions on how to fulfill the maintenance job. He or she doesn’t need a lot of training to do the job. If there’s something highly complicated, he or she will call an expert, and it will get fulfilled. Maintenance is done differently than before.', 'Simon London: Predictive maintenance is a single use case, but it’s bringing together different technologies into radically different processes to reach these step changes in performance improvement.', 'Enno de Boer: Correct. To give you another example, digital performance management is also a highly impactful use case. We all know the dashboards in manufacturing sites. You walk into a site, and today, all of those sites have dashboards. You see some KPIs [key performance indicators] lighting up, et cetera.', 'That’s not digital performance management. What digital performance management is, is that these dashboards get fed by sensors with accurate real-time data. We’re not talking in a management meeting anymore about whether this data is true because there’s one source of truth. It’s in there, it’s correct, and it’s real time. It’s right after the shift, so we can problem solve immediately. Now we want to drill down and understand something.', 'On a fingertip we can drill down into the data, make meaning out of it, and solve a problem, which in the past, would have taken us maybe two weeks until someone came back with an answer. Now we can do it right away. And with it, we have a new level of performance of our management.', 'Katy George: Another good example is the use of digital standard operating procedures, or digital SOPs, which I think is very exciting. Because, basically, it moves away from the horrible old notebooks that many plants used to have, which would list the different procedures, and people would be trained using them. I have plants where people are trained on hundreds of these procedures, and of course they don’t remember all of them. So, SOPs that are on a screen that they can see real time. It’s a bit like moving from using a map to using a GPS system.', 'As you look at the SOPs in real time, if a change happens—to the condition of a piece of equipment—you can change in real time to reflect to the new operating procedures that are required relative to that new condition or to the new task. It’s very exciting because it improves people’s productivity and it also brings dramatic improvements in the quality.', 'In many cases, plants will find that human error is one of the most important sources of variability, of deviation, of productivity loss, of any kind of error in the site. So this eliminates human error, because it tells people exactly what they can do. It also dramatically improves the time it takes to get people up to standard performance on a new task.', 'Simon London: Yes. It’s like, to use the math analogy again, you’re much less likely to get lost if you’ve got GPS.', 'Katy George: That’s right.', 'Enno de Boer: Let me give you one example. Imagine, for commercial airplanes, you do the wiring—a highly complex task. The work instructions are captured in a telephone-booklike work-instruction book. These days, we see that operators get virtual reality, and they get instructions as they go. The result is they don’t have errors anymore, and they are much more productive. They like it, because they don’t need to do this cumbersome work of looking through the instructions, and then doing something back and forth.', 'Katy George: Many of our clients have rolled out single technologies around specific kinds of use cases, often because they want to pilot and show the benefit of those single use cases. These lighthouse sites have put together many different use cases. There’s not one recipe for which combination they should be. But they put together many, and they’re piloting many more. That combination creates a scale effect that transforms the performance of the site, the culture of the site.', 'Simon London: That’s in the research, isn’t it? That there seems to be an optimum number of use cases to pursue, and it is a portfolio approach.', 'Enno de Boer: Yes. We see that around 20 to 30 use cases, applied to one site, creates a transformation of the value.', 'Bayer, in Italy, was able to increase productivity by 40 percent. The Bosch Wuxi site in China was already operating at 94 percent OEE [overall equipment effectiveness] and was able to squeeze out another 6 percent of output in capacity without doing capital investments. These are step-change performance changes.', 'Katy George: What’s important about that—if I can just add to this—is these are not plants that started as laggards and just used digital and automation to catch up. What we’re seeing is some of the very best plants across sectors finding that they can go beyond what they were already excellent in—in terms of lean-manufacturing capabilities, et cetera—and build on those, and by using these new technologies, take their performance to a whole new level.', 'The performance improvement is not just along one dimension. It’s not just that productivity improves. It’s that productivity and quality improve. Productivity and flexibility or agility improve. What we’re seeing, in both the lighthouse sites but more broadly in our research, is that this is a winner-takes-all kind of environment.', 'A lot of our clients are asking us, “Isn’t it OK just to be a fast follower? There’s such uncertainty in the technology.” And the answer is, “Probably not.” The front-runners get the spoils financially. The ones who have followed struggle to get to the same economic benefit.', 'Simon London: Do we know why that is?', 'Katy George: It’s because they have repositioned themselves competitively in such a significant way, in terms of cost structure but also in terms of customer experience and flexibility to new demand patterns, and things like that.', 'Enno de Boer: Let me give you an example. In terms of innovation, UPS together with Fast Radius, they entirely changed the game on spare-parts management. They are not putting spare parts on the shelves, for years. They have 3-D printers in their warehouse locations and send spare parts out on demand. That’s changing the game entirely. If you have figured that out at scale, it’s very hard to follow.', 'Simon London: How do you prevent, as a management team, with the arrival of these technologies, making people feel more like a cog in an automated machine? Where they’re getting instructions, and they’re fulfilling things, but they’re under constant supervision, being measured against the benchmarks, standard time, and standard procedures.', 'Katy George: In a sense, this is a nice progression of what we’ve seen in manufacturing over the last 50 years. If you go back to the assembly line, that was the worst in terms of being given a specific task, being part of a big machine, and just doing that task repetitively, and not being asked to do anything more than that.', 'When you get to the Toyota production system in lean, it unleashes human creativity and potential. People still have standard work, and they still have transactional work, but they’re also being asked to continually improve those standards along with their teammates. They have control over the system in that they can pull the Andon 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             Andon is a term used in manufacturing that refers to a system that can alert workers of a problem.\\r               \\r \\r  cord if there’s a problem that needs to be fixed.', 'Now we’re taking that one more step forward: we’re going to eliminate some of that standard transactional work and just leave the fun of the Toyota production system in terms of the ongoing continuous improvement, the creativity, et cetera.', 'I think we should face the fact that, what this will mean, at least in some production environments, is fewer people, because we will automate some of the tasks that people used to do. But for the people who are left, the jobs will be far more interesting, because they will be doing work that is more creative and more relationship based. It will be about them connecting to others and making things happen in the total system. This adds more value and is more fun.', 'Enno de Boer: At the Schneider Electric site, we saw that operators were able to create their own digital apps that support their work. They’re not waiting for cumbersome IT projects that take maybe a year until their problem is solved—and then it’s solved in a way that does not fit with how they can and want to do the work. We see a lot of engagement of the operators. They get excited, because they have the tools that they need to do their job in a very good manner.', 'Simon London: Presumably, this is one of the reasons why companies—that frankly are at the cutting edge of manufacturing in the pre–Industry 4.0 era—could have something of an advantage, because they know how to mobilize the workforce, how to engage a workforce, and how to bring the best out of people, which is part of the game.', 'Katy George: There’s no question. In fact, at some of the roundtables that we’ve led with manufacturing leaders who’ve been working on these transformations, you ask, “What’s your biggest failure mode?” And they’ve said, “The biggest failure mode is when we try to digitally transform a site that has not mastered lean.” Because not only is the workforce not prepared for this kind of change—but also the processes are not characterized well enough. Things are not under enough control to take full advantage of digital.', 'Enno de Boer: I agree with Katy. But I would also say, for someone who has not gone through the lean journey, that it’s not the time to wait, thinking that you can leapfrog. I talked about digital performance management. You would no longer do the standard performance management. You would put this immediately in place. But Katy is right. A good lean foundation helps you to go through your digital transformation much faster than if you need to, as you transform, also put these basics in place.', 'Simon London: My second devil’s advocate question: people listening to this may be thinking, “Are we being too optimistic about the number of jobs that will be lost or not gained during this transition?” I know you said that people are in evidence in these lighthouse projects. But what’s our overall takeaway in terms of the overall impact of this on job growth?', 'Katy George: I think this is another situation where “winner takes all” is relevant. What we’re seeing in our lighthouse sites is that they are rapidly improving their capacity and productivity—and using this so that they can grow, with the same number of people and the same number of fixed assets, which is healthy. What they’re seeing is that they’re taking more share, if you will. Of course, we’re in a demand growth economy right now, so they’re growing. When there is an economic downturn, someday, they’ll be in a far better position, because they have changed their breakeven point.', 'But for companies and for plants that are laggards, there is a serious question about what will happen to them as they try to catch up. Because there is no question that you can do more with fewer people. That will be one of the impacts of the Industry 4.0 revolution.', 'Enno de Boer: We’re concerned about the laggards. That’s why we’re working with the World Economic Forum. One mission of this work is to say, “How do we make sure that technology gets diffused? How do we make sure that we have inclusive growth?” Because we don’t want to see a big displacement. So, as Katy said, the laggards, that’s what’s concerning us most. It’s not only about the laggards as companies but also the laggards in a production network. They will be left behind, and there will be displacement. We want to prepare for that.', 'Simon London: And, in a production network, that means broadly within a single corporation. Certain plants are left behind. The question is, What happens to them if and when and how there’s a downturn? We would concede and agree that there is an impact on the overall number of jobs over time and relative to output. But I think the interesting point is, if you look at these advanced plants today, they are not lights-out manufacturing. They are not robot greenfield sites with no people.', 'Katy George: They are not lights-out manufacturing. They are places where the role of human beings has increased; they have become augmented: more interesting and more satisfying.', 'A lot of our research has looked at what the role of manufacturing is on an economy in general and on the global economy. In the 1950s, manufacturing was a very, very important source of jobs, employment, and growth. That’s no longer the case. That hasn’t been the case for some time. But it is critical to having a disproportionate share on productivity growth in an economy.', 'Productivity growth is important because that’s what drives our standard of living. That’s why it’s important to have a manufacturing core. Not to create the same kind of jobs that we saw in the 1950s but to drive productivity. Productivity has been stagnant for the last ten years globally. It’s a huge problem. This is one of the ways that we can see jump-starting productivity growth in a way that is important for each economy.', 'Simon London: We’ve been talking quite a lot about leaders, and laggards, and winner takes all. When you look at the geographic distribution of the lighthouses, are certain countries more present than others? What’s the pattern?', 'Enno de Boer: At the moment, you can take our research as representative in that way. But what we have seen is that we had an overproportionate share in China and in Asia, which at the beginning was a little bit surprising. We also have a big share in Europe. We have not so big a share in the US. That makes me very concerned.', 'Katy George: That is, unfortunately, not surprising. Because we’ve been tracking statistics around adoption of robotics and other digital capabilities. And the US is lagging Germany. It’s lagging Asia. The places where the US should have a competitive advantage are places that the US is not actually finding a way to invest in order to create that advantage.', 'Simon London: We’ve mentioned 3-D printing as additive manufacturing in this conversation. How widespread is it? Where’s it being adopted? A few years in, what is it good for?', 'Enno de Boer: 3-D printing is exciting, I think. I grew up with 3-D printing in prototyping, and it was inherently expensive. If you now look at it, it’s penetrating mass markets. For example, we see that small parts in smartphones are now 3-D printed.', 'How do they do that economically? They print 100,000 of these parts in batches—then it’s economically viable—because the parts are exactly designed and integrated in a way that was not possible before.', 'Katy George: But 3-D printing is not the only technology that’s going to enable new levels of customization, for example, or new business models. We’re talking with a clothing manufacturer that’s setting up local production for customized clothing.', 'It’s going to be using some of the same technology that already exists in sewing but taking pattern making, and cutting, and some of the other elements to a whole new level by creating flexible automation and digital control. There are a lot of different technologies that will be used in different combinations to achieve some of these benefits.', 'Simon London: The other technology that we’ve mentioned, without going into the detail, is Internet of Things sensors, broadly speaking. How important is IoT in this transformation?', 'Enno de Boer: Very important. IoT, if I take the analogy of the human body, is the nerve system. That’s IoT. Then you have the sensors. The sensors get connected to the nervous system. Then you have the big brain. The big brain is the cloud.', 'IoT goes into the cloud. There, some intelligence is happening. Then you have the small brain. That’s IoT at the edge. Artificial intelligence at the edge. So, a couple of repetitive things that need to happen in a distributed way', 'Then you have the arms and legs. That’s the automation in the end. That’s how it all works together. And I think that’s what makes me most excited about this field, is all these great technologies come together. Only if we put them together in the right way will we get the results, because they are all a piece of the puzzle.', 'Katy George: IoT is exciting in the kind of transformational impact it can have within the organism of a manufacturing site, for example. But it also—when you put IoT into the final product and can get customer usage data from it—it also creates incredible feedback loops to how you think about product design, how you think about marketing, how you think about production, and how you think about what’s most important to consumers. How do you make a product more rugged for the way it’s actually used? IoT will be game changing in many, many industries.', 'Simon London: When you’re working with clients on these kinds of issues, trying to help them navigate this journey to full digital manufacturing, what are some of the hurdles that you see? What are some of the failure modes that come up over and again?', 'Katy George: The primary failure mode that we see, that exhibits in different ways, is something we’re calling pilot purgatory—companies launch pilots around new technologies and somehow never get past that to actually scale and get the benefits of scaling.', 'The benefits of scaling are about scaling a use case beyond one small line to at least the scale of a plant or of a network. But also scaling in the sense of combining multiple use cases together to create the connectivity, the culture, the innovation, and the pace that a lighthouse plant exhibits.', 'There are a lot of reasons why companies never get past pilot purgatory. One is slow decision making, where there is a slow process for acquiring new technology or for completing a partnership. They’re somehow able to get a pilot going but are slow to scale.', 'Another is having a backward-looking approach to return on investment [ROI]—not being able to allocate capital, even small amounts of capital, to scale something that has proved to work. Because they’re always looking for some ROI hurdle that won’t exist until they do scale multiple things together. Those are a couple of reasons why companies are getting stuck in this pilot purgatory. But it’s something we’re seeing many, many companies grapple with.', 'Simon London: How do you get out of it?', 'Enno de Boer: You need to figure out what you want to do with digital manufacturing. I get called in a lot where people say, “Tell us what this is.” I ask back, “What problem do you want to solve?”', 'First, it’s about the business problem you need to solve—and the impact. As Katy said earlier, there are several business dimensions and impact dimensions that you can take. You can be more agile. You can be faster to market. You can be more productive. You can mass personalize. But please define what you want to get out of it.', 'Katy George: I think one of the other failure modes is when companies get excited about “shiny new objects,” in terms of new technologies, and take a technology-forward approach as opposed to what I would describe as a business-value-back approach. Embracing cool technology just for the sake of it, and trying to implement as much as possible, does not create any real business value.', 'You have to do the hard work of understanding what your competitive advantage is going to be, how you want to change it or enhance it using digital, and then work backward to see what the new capabilities are that you want to build with digital and advantaged-analytics capabilities.', 'Simon London: So, don’t start with augmented-reality headsets, playing around with them and just trying to figure out, “What are we going to do with these?”', 'Katy George: Exactly right.', 'Enno de Boer: We need to stop with these bottom-up approaches where we tell our people, “OK, go innovate. Do a little bit here and there.” We see this. And pilot purgatory means there are pilots all over the network that are not coordinated. You need to pull these all together. I think this is a time where leaders need to lean in. We need top management to lean in and decide which direction they want to take. Otherwise they will not be able to scale up.', 'Then if you have the strategy, you need to put some scale-up enablers in place. You need to put the right IT stack in place. You don’t need to do that from the very beginning. Don’t be scared that you need to invest a lot. The first use cases will work without, and they will be self-funding, so you can ease your way into this transformation. But at some point you will need to step back and innovate and modernize your IT stack.', 'You need to put a new people model in place. You need data scientists, yes. But that’s not enough. You need translators. You need data engineers. You need all sorts of capabilities, and, most important, you need to upskill your management and your people so that they can work with these new capabilities.', 'You need to put a new data model in place and a new analytics model. All of these are scale-up enablers that are needed to go much faster, not incremental or use case by use case. But get the value at a low-increment cost.', 'Simon London: I’m reminded of a business book that was published many, many years ago—see if you remember it—called Crossing the Chasm [HarperCollins, 1991]. It was about tech companies and how they get to scale. It sounds like there’s a similar thing here. There are many companies with a lot of good and interesting pilots, but somehow you have to cross the chasm. It’s at that point you probably need serious senior-management attention, and you need a strategy and investment. At a certain point, somebody just has to decide, “We’re going to cross the chasm.”', 'Enno de Boer: And it’s not about talking anymore. It’s not about playing around anymore. It’s all tested out. We have a lot of proofs of concept out there. We have viable use cases out there. You don’t need to play around anymore with these technologies. Figure out what problem you want to solve. Then figure out what the use cases are that can help you, and then scale them up.', 'Simon London: Super.

70,What makes an organization ‘healthy’?,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/what-makes-an-organization-healthy,Research shows that companies can improve short- and long-term performance by focusing on a small number of carefully selected management practices.,"['Research shows that companies can improve short- and long-term performance by focusing on a small number of carefully selected management practices.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey partners Rajesh Krishnan and Brooke Weddle about the ins and outs of organizational health.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be talking about health—organizational health. But before you reach for your yoga mat, no, this isn’t about health and wellness. Instead, we’ll be talking about organizations that are healthy in the sense of being high functioning and high performing over the long term.', 'The concept is based on 15 years of research into the management practices of enduring, successful organizations. To understand more, I spoke with Brooke Weddle and Rajesh Krishnan, McKinsey partners who spend a lot of time with clients working to improve their performance by focusing on their health. So, Brooke and Rajesh, welcome to the podcast.', 'Brooke Weddle: Great to be here, Simon.', 'Rajesh Krishnan: Likewise, Simon. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to do this.', 'Simon London: Brooke, when I hear the words “organizational health,” the first thing that comes to mind for me is Zumba classes and fitness trackers. But that’s not what we’re going to be talking about, right?', 'Brooke Weddle: No. It’s not. But I think the metaphor, in some ways, helps. Organizational health is about the way in which you run your organization to effectively deliver against your performance goals, much as you would with physical health. You want to have an exercise regime that allows you to achieve a level of mental and physical health to be able to deliver against your own ambition levels as an individual. Organizations need to do the same thing.', 'There’s a technical definition associated with this as well. We like to say that organizational health is composed of three things. One is how well the organization aligns around a common strategy. Two, how the strategy then translates down into the work environment—how well the organization executes against its strategy and its ambition. Three is how well it renews itself over time, which basically means two things: one, looking outside, staying in tune with the customer or its clients, and two, having an internal innovation engine so that you can allow those insights to be brought into the organization and turned into something useful in terms of driving innovation and new capabilities.', 'Simon London: That all sounds very reasonable, but how did we decide that these are the things—alignment, execution, and renewal—that define a healthy organization?', 'Brooke Weddle: The research dates back over 15 years, Simon. Initially, we were trying to understand what set apart organizations that performed for long periods of time. Many of us have seen the data from the S&P 500 where the tenure of the average company is decreasing.', 'The idea is that the organizations that lasted focused on what we later called organizational health as much as they did on performance [Exhibit 1]. When you break it down, you see that there are nine outcomes and 37 management practices. Those are the things that organizations do to drive the outcome.', '', 'Simon London: I’m feeling a little bit slow today, Brooke. So, just make sure I understand this distinction between outcomes and practices.', 'Brooke Weddle: Let’s take motivation. What do you do to motivate your employees? You pay them. You give them career opportunities. You reward them, and you recognize them using nonfinancial tools and levers. You want to help them find meaning in their work. We’ve all seen that research. And you need to lead them by being inspirational.', 'Those are exactly the practices that sit behind the motivation outcome. When we look at those levels of data, we can help an organization understand what the levers are that they’re using to drive motivation. What is working well? What is not working well from an impact standpoint on that outcome?', 'Simon London: And just to clarify, the data about practices that companies are using and whether people are indeed motivated, aligned, and so on: How do we get it?', 'Brooke Weddle: Well, it’s actually quite simple. We ask employees. So, all of our organizational health data comes from the tool, the Organizational Health Index [OHI]. It’s a survey that we generally deploy to the entire organization. We ask for their views and perspectives on the nine outcomes that we talked about and the 37 management practices.', 'We have over six million respondents in the database. I think we’re up to two thousand companies that have deployed the OHI—25 percent of the Fortune 500. We like to say that when you add it all up, we have a billion data points on organizational health. The interesting thing about doing it in this way is that, of course, you hear directly from employees, and that’s important. But the other things that you see through the data are differences.', 'One that frequently comes up is that leaders in the company have a very biased view of their organization’s health. They have an overly positive view of it. We’ve been in many eye-opening conversations with leadership teams where we show them the difference in perception between the front line and the leadership team. It’s a real moment of clarity, looking at how people are seeing the way in which the place is run, compared to the way you see it, and the blind spots that that suggests.', 'Simon London: And then, of course, you can link the health goals back to performance metrics, which is where the rubber hits the road.', 'Brooke Weddle: That’s right. We have research that looks at outcome measures that are related to total returns to shareholders to productivity measures in a call center and even to patient-error rates in a hospital. We’re able to look at a diverse set of performance outcomes and link that back to organizational health in terms of positive correlations.', 'Simon London: Rajesh, let me bring you in here. I know a lot of your work is with organizations going through performance transformations. Just to play devil’s advocate: Why are you interested in all this soft stuff about management practices and behaviors?', 'Rajesh Krishnan: It is definitely the behaviors. But I wouldn’t characterize it as soft stuff. When we talk about transformations, we’re talking about dramatic change in the performance of that organization, which means that the organization is underperforming right now. Something needs to materially change so that it can do better—better margins, better revenues, whatever the metric might be. They’re unlikely to do that unless they fundamentally look at what’s not working today and changing the way that’s done.', 'Ripping costs out, for example, is not a transformation. If you go in somewhere, you can always find things you can stop buying, but you haven’t fundamentally changed the issue that got that company to underperform in the first place.', 'Looking at the company holistically, running the OHI, which is our instrument to measure health, we understand the behaviors that are getting people in that organization stuck in the first place. We then figure out why that’s happening and fix them. This is a commitment you have to make if you want to transform.', 'When you run the OHI, you might find out, for example, that there’s poor consequence management. That people often sign up for goals and targets, but they miss them, and when they miss them, they’re not held accountable. Well, if that behavior persists—even if you choose to set a transformation and you have a big aspiration—chances are, people will continue to fail. As a result, you will never get out of the hole you’re in.', 'We think the key is being holistic. Looking at performance: Where do we think there are opportunities, whether from a sales standpoint, an operations standpoint, or a function standpoint? And then looking at health in performance: What is a behavior we need to emphasize and reinforce? We think these two together give you an answer that’ll allow you to get to the end state that you want as a company or as an institution.', 'Simon London: This sounds mighty complicated. I think Brooke mentioned earlier that there are, what, 37 different management practices underpinning the OHI? I mean, surely, in any context, that’s too many for managers to hold in their heads.', 'Rajesh Krishnan: We don’t recommend that people focus on 37. In fact, we know that if you try focusing on all 37, you will fail. What is important to understand is that when you look at your team, or when you look at your unit, as a manager, you want to get a sense of what’s not working well, or as well as you would like it to, and what is important for your success.', 'And then we would recommend that you prioritize a manageable set of behaviors that will help you go after the performance improvement that you want to unlock. For the transformation contexts that I serve, that number is typically around eight to 12 things, because these are companies or organizations that are looking to drive a material performance gain. For them to do that, there are a number of things they need to change about the way they run their places.', 'On the other hand, there are some organizations that are quite well run. Maybe it’s just a handful, three to five things, that they want to focus on. So, just like when you go to the doctor, there might be a couple of things that look out of whack, and you might want to focus on those and make sure they are under control. This is a true diagnostic. It helps identify the areas of opportunity. Then you should prioritize them, and that becomes the right thing for you to focus on.', 'Brooke Weddle: To build on what Rajesh is saying, we use a concept called the “recipes” to help organizations prioritize the management practices that they’re going to focus on, knowing that they shouldn’t focus on all 37. The way that we develop the recipes is that we say that it’s not good enough to have the perspective that all 37 management practices are created equal. We should look at the data and see what the topperforming companies in our database, from a health perspective, are doing when it comes to prioritizing these different practices.', 'When we did a cluster analysis, there were four recipes that emerged. We’ve done this twice now. The recipes have remained the same in terms of the general clustering. The four recipes are “Leadership Factory,” “Market Shaper,” “Execution Edge”—or “Continuous Improvement Engine”—and “Talent/Knowledge Core” [Exhibit 2].', '', 'Simon London: And just to clarify, each of these recipes describes a kind of management philosophy or an archetype, right? A bundle of different practices.', 'Brooke Weddle: That’s right. Leadership Factory would be about deriving a competitive advantage from building a strong leadership advantage. When you look at iconic companies that are doing this, you see them overinvesting in leadership development—in talent programs that put leaders in stretch opportunities and stretch roles—to try to enable that development to happen more quickly, and deriving a competitive advantage.', 'For Market Shaper, you see companies that have an outsize emphasis on shaping the market, shaping customer preferences, and building goods and services to meet those needs—and even creating goods and services not only to meet a need but also to actually create something that customers didn’t even know they needed in the first place.', 'Third, the Execution Edge is a group of companies deriving competitive advantage from getting better every day. This is where you would see some of the classic lean principles playing out. The heart of the Execution Edge recipe is the group of management practices that focus on innovation—bottom-up innovation, top-down innovation—and leverage the full power of the workforce. You see employee involvement, you see performance transparency—holding people accountable in visible ways.', 'Finally, you have Talent/Knowledge Core. That’s the only recipe that emerges more as an industry-specific type. Here you would find companies that are involved in professional services, R&D. In some cases, you see some of the sciences show up here. Innovation.', 'The companies here are focused on getting the best talent and expertise and cultivating that in ways that allow them to stay ahead of the competition. Giving people great career opportunities. Of course, paying them very well, in some cases. Rewarding and recognizing them. And ensuring that their recruiting engines are always best in class.', 'Simon London: Rajesh, just to bring us home, maybe give us a concrete example. What are the kind of management practices that underpin one of these recipes? Pick any one you like.', 'Rajesh Krishnan: Let’s say you’re a manufacturing organization and you have picked the Execution Edge, or the Continuous Improvement Engine, recipe. The practice that is probably the most important to that recipe is performance transparency, which is, very simply put, how to make results in an individual, in a unit, easily accessible and widely available for people to look at, with the belief that if that information is made available, good things happen.', 'Let’s say you’re a manufacturing plant and your yields are low. You’re not producing as many units as you would like. Providing performance transparency in that instance, taking the time to say, “Let’s have a dashboard that shows—for every single line that we have in this plant—how many units we are producing and how many units have quality defects, or whatever the metric is. And let’s just make that available across all the different teams that we have.”', 'What tends to happen in those situations, instantly, is everyone always anchors on who’s at the top and if it is possible for them to get from where they are to where they can be, because you made these results accessible. If that line can operate at 96 percent utilization, why are you operating at 72 percent utilization? People try and understand. They’re motivated to do better. But they also understand, perhaps, what is allowing that line to operate at its best. And they make changes to their maintenance schedules. They bring in more knowledgeable people to fix things. And it gets better.', 'Similarly, let’s say you’re a sales manager who has to sell the products of this plant. And you have a number of salespeople, and your margins have been declining, even though your sales have remained flat. Providing transparency, not just on revenues but also on margins generated by salespeople, often helps, because salespeople tend to be a competitive bunch.', 'The performance transparency you’re providing here is not a culture exercise that’s happening on the side. It is a management behavior that allows us to get better by learning what the other person is doing, and just knowing where to aspire to. That’s why we don’t think these things are separate or that health often is at the detriment of near-term performance. If anything, it is used to accelerate and provide performance gains when used in the right way.', 'Simon London: Presumably, when you open this conversation with clients, most management teams have a fairly clear idea of the recipe or the management philosophy that they’re pursuing. And, therefore, the management practices that they should be prioritizing.', 'Brooke Weddle: A lot of the companies that Rajesh and I work with actually don’t have at least a common understanding of the recipe or management philosophy that they are pursuing. This causes a lot of cognitive dissonance in the organization about how to run the place: Where should I be spending my time if I have an incremental hour? Should I be on the front line trying to get an hour’s worth of improvement out of the frontline crew there? Or, should I spend an hour of my time investing in and trying to understand the next generation of insights from a customer focus group?', 'It has significant implications for the alignment around a common way to run the place, when you think about this recipe. But most companies wouldn’t be able to clearly articulate what that is. The organizational-health discussion allows them to have a clearer conversation about that using a common language.', 'Rajesh Krishnan: You want to constantly—not every year, but every two, three, five years—reevaluate where you are, what recipe you have selected, and what is likely to lead you to success. We think the recipes are useful to get a sense of what sets of behaviors work.', 'But the recipe, to me as a manager, is not that helpful. What I want to know is, What are the things that my teams think we’re not doing as well as others are? Where is there room for improvement? If, for example, you say there are not enough career opportunities, there are not enough rewards or recognition, or that I’m not being a supportive leader, that’s helpful for me, because I know what behaviors can help overcome that.', 'If I’m overanchoring on challenging or authoritative leadership, what are the behavior changes that I need to bring in, so that I’m seen as a balanced leader who’s able to get the most out of my team? If there’s a lack of role clarity, it’s clear that I probably need to have discussions with all my team members and make it clear who’s responsible for what and who they need to go to for help.', 'Once you move the expectations from “let’s follow a recipe for success” to the behavior being the unit at which change occurs, it just makes it tangible. I can get specific actions. If I act, I will improve the health of my team. As the statistics say, when that happens, the performance improves as well.', 'Simon London: Let’s talk a bit more about companies going through real performance transformations, which was the topic for the article “The yin and yang of organizational health.” What are some of the considerations in a transformation context in particular? What does the data tell us about what works?', 'Rajesh Krishnan: When we looked at a set of transformations that we worked on over the past few years, there were four themes that emerged, with eight practices, in particular, that led to material improvements in health and in performance. The four themes were, one, making sure there’s a clear direction for the transformation. What are we trying to achieve? Is there a vision that all of us can rally around? Is there strategic clarity in terms of all the business units, the teams, and everyone knowing what the goals are that we’re going for? What are the milestones? When do we need to accomplish them?', 'Two, that cascades down to providing clarity and meaning for employees. Does every individual employee know their role in delivering this vision that the company has? Do people feel engaged? Are employees involved in being able to set the direction for themselves? In doing so, do they look for ideas, and do they look for innovations?', 'Three is about capturing external ideas—looking outside, from your suppliers, from your customers, from other parties that you engage with. Can you bring innovations in that you can try? It is also about encouraging bottom-up innovation, which is asking your front line to think about how they can provide input that changes the way in which work gets done.', 'Finally, there is making sure there’s a strong performance cadence. The transformations that we undertake have a strong infrastructure that makes sure that you’re operationally disciplined, that you live up to the commitments that you have made, and that you deliver on time and in value. But the theme also includes making sure that that’s supplemented by supportive leadership, so that if there are genuine reasons why we couldn’t perform at the level we wanted to, there is an environment that allows for us to care about the employees’ welfare and that gives them a chance to be able to come back and do better.', 'These are the four things that we think of, when they come together, that are powerful in having a direction, making sure that there is clarity for the individual, that we have ideas that we bring in to spark the transformation, that we have an infrastructure that allows for us to be disciplined. But at the same time, they allow for support and welfare to be priorities that leadership focuses on.', 'Brooke Weddle: The research was interesting—because it was interesting to see operationally disciplined leadership side by side with supportive leadership. Those seemed to be, in some ways, not opposite, but working against each other. How can you be a supportive leader but also have a fair amount of discipline?', 'When we looked at the other practices, we again saw this theme of balance across the two elements. So, yes, strategic clarity. But that’s not enough. You also need to create this more kind of qualitative shared vision. In the case of sparking ideas and innovation, it was about, yes, the bottom-up innovation inside the organization, but the only way to do that well is to look outside and to capture those external ideas.', 'That’s why we ended up calling the article “yin and yang,” because there was a sense of balance between the two elements. I think that resonated with us in terms of our own personal experience, because even if you go back to the physical-health analogy, you can see that just doing the hard lifting every day would probably not enable you to achieve your health goals. You also have to balance that with stretching, with doing some yoga, with some of the softer elements of exercise. It was interesting the way that that research played out.', 'Rajesh Krishnan: One of the clients that I served made a strong point to emphasize innovating from within. When it had to design new safety equipment, it went to its front line and said, “Well, what do you need? And can we get your input in making sure that we design the best possible visor for you?”', 'In terms of capturing external ideas, it was a very siloed organization. It was very insular. There was a “not invented here” syndrome, because at some point in time, it had been the best at what it was doing. But then it completely turned around. For any new hire who joined the organization, it spent a few days to a week trying to understand how stuff happened in the old job. Even if the industry was different. Could those ideas have relevance for how this organization worked?', 'In one of its Asian markets, it found out that there were ways to manage trade, to access different markets, and to manage the regulatory system. This was immensely helpful for unlocking new ways of doing things. These things combined can become powerful.', 'Simon London: What I love about that example is that it’s intensely practical. It really answers the question, “What should we be doing differently as a management team today?”', 'Brooke Weddle: I think the point, linking it back to behaviors, is that the recipes can help you, alongside the transformation practices, in focusing on a short set of management practices to focus on. But from there, it is about basically running workouts. You need to build some new muscles. That’s when behaviors, and frankly the mind-sets that underlie them, come into play.', 'This is not about just talking at the level of “we need better role clarity.” It’s about understanding: “Well, what’s the mind-set holding us back from not having straightforward conversations about my role versus yours?” Maybe that feels uncomfortable. Maybe there’s an issue around power and me wanting to keep doing this part of the job because I get a lot of recognition for it. Without going and doing that deeper work, you won’t be able to make those behavioral shifts that we know are critical to driving improvements in health.', 'Simon London: What are some of the dos and don’ts for getting substantive, sustainable improvements in organizational health? What are some of the failure modes? What are some of the things not to do?', 'Rajesh Krishnan: Probably the most important thing that we’ve found is that you shouldn’t do this on the side. This is not a culture program for a culture’s sake. This is not about trust falls and doing cartwheels and singing “Kumbaya.” This is about “if we look at how we get work done, what do we need to do better?”', 'You need a top team that is committed to making the change happen. Because, as with everything, role modeling is the single most important thing to do. In general, there are people who don’t know what is being asked of them. Or there are multiple people doing the same thing. It often tends to be because the top team has overlapping responsibilities or has a misunderstanding of who’s actually responsible for what outcome.', 'Fixing those issues means getting those people to be clear in terms of: Who’s responsible for what? Who do they need to go to for authority? By when do they need to get things done? Who else do they need to get input from? If that role modeling is done by the top, we find that that flows down across all the ranks of the organization. Having the CEO and the top team bought into the types of change that you’re bringing about is important.', 'Brooke Weddle: I think the common trap here is that when working on organizational health—because it is perceived to be, and in some sense rightly so, a way to change the culture of the organization—it is seen to be an HR topic only. I think Rajesh and I would both say, based on our experiences, that keeping it only in the realm of HR significantly limits the potential of the organization to drive health.', 'Rajesh mentioned the need to have the top team fully bought in and role modeling the organizational-health behaviors. When it’s seen as something on the side, something driven only by HR, the impact of role modeling is that it doesn’t happen or is that it doesn’t happen as well.', 'Simon London: On that note, I’m sorry to say we are out of time for today. Brooke and Rajesh, thanks for your patience putting up with a lot of basic questions. It was enlightening and great fun talking to you.', 'Brooke Weddle: Thanks, Simon.

71,What is leadership: Moving beyond the C-Suite,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/what-is-leadership,Developing leaders at scale starts with a clear perspective on the leadership skills needed to execute strategy across the organization.,"['Developing leaders at scale starts with a clear perspective on the leadership skills needed to execute strategy across the organization.', 'What is leadership? In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast,  Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partner Claudio Feser and associate partner Nicolai Nielsen about this deceptively simple question, drawing on research from their new book, Leadership at Scale: Better Leadership, Better Results.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. I think everybody wants to learn about leadership and with good reason. We all know from experience that the difference between a happy, high-performing team and a miserable, somewhat dysfunctional team often comes down to the quality of its leadership. And yet, what exactly is good leadership? How do you develop yourself as a leader? And, importantly, from a management perspective, how can organizations develop real depth of leadership? Not just among a few executives at the top but up and down the organizational chart and across business units and functions.', 'To answer these questions, I sat down in Zurich with McKinsey senior partner Claudio Feser and associate partner Nicolai Nielsen. Claudio and Nicolai are coauthors, along with Michael Rennie, of the new book Leadership at Scale. Claudio and Nicolai, thank you for being here, and welcome to the podcast.', 'Claudio Feser: Thanks for having us.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: Happy to be here.', 'Simon London: Let’s start with the big question, probably capital “B,” capital “Q.” Claudio, what is leadership? What are our core beliefs at McKinsey about what leadership is and what it isn’t?', 'Claudio Feser: There are hundreds of definitions of leadership. If you ask ten people for a definition of leadership, you’re likely to get more than ten answers. To actually address it, we need to start from a definition. We need to define what we mean by “leadership.” The way we have defined “leadership” is as a set of behaviors that leaders exercise to influence organizational members to achieve a higher alignment on the direction that the organization is taking, to achieve a better execution of the strategy, and for the organization to continuously renew itself.', 'Alignment, execution, and renewal—that goes back to our work on organizational health. We learned that when organizational members are aligned on a strategy, when they execute consistently and effectively, when they continuously scan the environment for opportunities, and when they continuously learn and renew themselves, that organization tends to overperform, or outperform, over long periods of time. We decided to focus on a set of behaviors by which leaders align, improve execution, and improve the ability to renew an organization.', 'Simon London: So broadly speaking, it’s about observable behaviors that lead to these measurable outcomes around alignment, around execution, and around renewal?', 'Claudio Feser: Correct. It’s about observable behaviors, because we lead through behaviors. Communicating effectively is a behavior. Being able to engage people by listening is a behavior. Giving a direction is a behavior. Leaders influence their environment—and organizational members—through a set of behaviors. And that’s our starting point.', 'Simon London: It’s not some ineffable, indefinable something?', 'Claudio Feser: If you develop a perspective about leadership as innate type of capabilities, there will always be a finite number of leaders. But the reality is, if you ask any leader to describe where they learned leading, they will always talk about their own personal experience, how they have grown, and how they have learned a set of behaviors by which they influence others.', 'Once, I had a conversation with a CEO, and I asked him why he was leading in a certain way. He wasn’t particularly strong in engaging, but he was very strong in directing. That was his way of achieving impact. After our conversation, he shared with me that he had a very painful experience as a young executive, where he had started to bond very closely with his employees. But then, when a cost-cutting program came his way, he had to fire lots of friends. That created with him a leadership style which was effective, but not very engaging. So he became a very directive leader.', 'That’s just to explain that it’s our experiences, it’s behaviors that we’ve exercised in the past that were successful, that shape our leadership style. Yes, leadership is a set of behaviors in this sense.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: A couple of thoughts I have: the reason we focus so much on observable behaviors is because leadership has to be looked at objectively. Observable behaviors make it very, very clear what we see happen on a day-to-day basis on the job. And that helps us analyze whether this is effective leadership or not. One more thought is that leadership is highly contextual, so it is about behaviors. But those behaviors are based on the context. So effective leadership in one context can be very, very different from effective leadership in another.', 'Simon London: So that raises another interesting question, which is, can leadership be taught?', 'Claudio Feser: I do believe that the concept of teaching leadership might be a bit at the core of some of the problems that we have, because leadership is a set of behaviors, and because behaviors are learned in practice—not so much in a classroom, they’re learned in practice. Maybe the concept of teaching leadership is at odds with how adults learn.', 'We learn by doing. We learn by trying. We learn by failing. As we do so, we develop skills. We learn to communicate. We learn to empathize. We learn to direct. We learn to execute. We learn to follow up. These are all behaviors that we learn by trying, by improving, by succeeding. And because we do that ourselves most of the time, I think that this is a bit at odds with the concept of teaching. It’s more a question about enabling learning.', 'For us, a leadership-development program builds a lot around coaching, mentoring, and having people trying to solve difficult problems—and being supported while they do so—because when they solve them, they learn. I’m not sure anyone picked up any leadership skill by sitting in a class and listening to a professor describing a skill, what that really is.', 'Simon London: There’s that famous Henry Mintzberg quote that leadership is a bit like swimming, that you can’t learn it from books. Ultimately, you have to get in the water.', 'Claudio Feser: Exactly.', 'Simon London: So it sounds almost like we’re describing leadership like a skill, something that could be learned in that way. Is that the right way to think about it?', 'Nicolai Nielsen: Partly. I think we look at it a bit broader than that. We look at the leadership behaviors in a context. They need to be enabled by both a certain set of skills and an underlying mindset. Let me build on that. From a skills point of view, we look at what it takes to display the leadership behaviors in the context effectively. And if a leader is able to consistently perform those behaviors over and over again, you could say that they have an underlying skill.', 'Claudio Feser: So leadership behaviors become skills if they’re carried out consistently. Very often in discussions with leadership gurus or studies, you will hear the word “mindset” and how mindset is important for leadership. Now, the way we look at this is as follows: for us, mindset is an enabler or a blockage for leadership skills.', 'I will never be a great communicator if I’m convinced I’m not good at communicating. Or I will never engage in courageous conversations if I’m always afraid of looking for a discussion or a confrontation. Mindsets can very much be blockages but also can enable behavioral change, can actually allow leaders to grow and to expand their repertoire of leadership skills or competencies.', 'Much of our work, when we work on developing new capabilities, new skills, new competencies, so new sets of observable behaviors, is at the mindset level. We try to understand, why is that leader not behaving the way one would expect in the situation? What might be the mindset that blocks him or her? And we then work at that dimension.', 'Mindsets can very much be blockages but also can enable behavioral change, can actually allow leaders to grow and to expand their repertoire of leadership skills or competencies.', 'Simon London: Is it true that you cannot develop as a leader unless you’re prepared to go there, you’re prepared to actually engage in some reflection about yourself and your mindsets? And that’s the underlying hard work?', 'Claudio Feser: Let me be precise. I think you can be a great leader without doing that, by coincidence. You have thousands of leaders who actually don’t go at that level. But they have developed their own leadership styles that work for them and work effectively in the situations they are in. However, what we very often see is, when the situation changes, they’re not able to change their behaviors, because they have not worked at that level.', 'For us, when we talk about a leader growing, we talk about a leader developing new sets of behaviors, observable behaviors, that can help that leader also be successful in other circumstances and other situations. And for that, we need to intervene at the mindset level, or help at the mindset level, very often.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: A lot of this is around increasing the awareness of the leader. And that goes for making the unconscious more conscious and giving the leader a new language to think about how they actually can become a more effective leader. That starts with them thinking through, “What is it I’m trying to achieve on the job? What is my strategic imperative? Very concretely, what behaviors do I need to actually display to get there?”', 'If the leader needs to demonstrate a more, let’s say, visionary and growth-oriented strategy, something that a leader is not comfortable with, because it’s not something that they have gone through before, we help them think through, both at the individual and the organizational levels, what are the concrete skills? What are some of the tools that we’ve seen work in other places that they could actually use to demonstrate those behaviors?', 'In parallel, what are the underlying mindsets that they need to have? And where are they today? It helps to just break it down, I think, in a more systematic way, and a leader can then engage both at the skill level—what they do and don’t have experience with today—and also at the mindset level. How would they approach this task as their default, if you will? And what are some of the underlying mindset shifts they might need to have to become a more effective leader?', 'Simon London: Can you just talk a little bit more about some of the typical situations where this level of growth or change is required in a leader? You mentioned, for example, maybe moving from a growth strategy to a more sort of containment strategy, or vice versa. Presumably, there are elements around just getting a promotion, moving to the next level, becoming a CEO, for example, and needing to learn new skills and therefore needing to examine your mindset. Just talk a little bit about some of the situations that we come across in practice.', 'Claudio Feser: There are many reasons why we get into situations where it is desirable for someone to expand his or her leadership repertoire, when it’s time to learn some new behaviors. We very often hear about dysfunctional leaders, or leaders that actually are weak in certain dimensions. That happens too.', 'But by and large, it is the context changing, it is the role changing, that very often prompts a leader to reflect about their own leadership capabilities and how to adapt their behaviors. The way we try to identify that is by having a good understanding of the context. We spend quite some time trying to understand, what is the mandate of the leader in this context? What are the challenges of this leader in this context? We then try to measure existing behaviors based on a 360 [assessment] so that we can almost clinically, or surgically, then help a leader grow in those areas where he or she might have the biggest bang for their buck, if I may say.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: What’s interesting is that the leadership behaviors that have often gotten a leader to where they are in the organization—let’s say, they’ve gotten a promotion, or they’ve grown their mandate—those behaviors could sometimes even hold them back going forward. So they might have gotten to where they were because they were perhaps very, very directive. They were extremely good at what they did. They were the best at their jobs. And they were able to propel their team, their organization forward and get the results. When they then get to a larger mandate, perhaps when the organization needs to move to a more expansive strategy, what they might find is that those same behaviors can actually hold them back.', 'Simon London: You’ve mentioned this a couple of times, this shift that is sometimes needed from a more directive style of leadership. Presumably, in those kinds of circumstances, the leader is overindexing on execution. We mentioned alignment, execution, and renewal as being the three key tasks of leadership.', 'It sounds like this is something we come across quite often: that leaders are extremely good at execution. I mean, as you say, that’s what got them to where they are. But actually, as they grow, the organization needs more inspiration. It needs renewal. It needs a little bit less focus on the direction and the execution. Is that a fair reflection?', 'Claudio Feser: That is a fair reflection. What I’d like, though, to highlight is that it is not instead of. Often, and maybe it’s encapsulated a little bit in this phrase of “expanding their repertoire,” as leaders grow, they don’t need to throw out all that they’ve learned before. It took them where they are. It created a lot of values for the organizations in which they lead.', 'The way we think about this is, we want them to be able to expand their skill set. So as they grow in an organization, they add new dimensions on to the execution dimension. They will have to learn to allow the organization to renew. They have to learn to engage employees. They have to be able to inspire their people.', 'For us, it is more about expanding and learning new capabilities. It’s not this classical, “What got you here won’t get you there, and you have to forget what you have done so far.” That’s not how it works in practice. And it’s not even helpful to think about that that way.', 'Simon London: When we’re working for organizations, are we typically working with one or two people at the top? Or is it helpful to think about leadership and leadership development across an organization?', 'Claudio Feser: We believe that there is a huge “unlock” for organizations to develop a cadre of leaders, a sizeable cadre of leaders. Our work and our research show that organizations that built a significant number of leaders tend to outperform those that focus in on the very few. And that’s a reason why we’re focusing our work on developing a large number of people in an organization.', 'Simon London: How many is a large number? How many people do you need to touch in an organization for this to be effective?', 'Claudio Feser: Well, for us, when we talk about leadership at scale, we start from 50 to thousands of people. This is really about developing leadership capabilities across an organization. It’s about making sure that team leaders, department leaders, divisional leaders all learn in a facilitated way a set of leadership skills that will make them, and as a consequence, the organization, more effective.', 'Bear in mind that when we talk about the leadership capabilities of an organization, the organization, per se, is not a human being. An organization, per se, carries out behavior that is a sum of behaviors of the people who are in that organization. The more people lead in a consistent and effective way, the more effective the organization will be.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: And to build on that, individuals who are not engaged directly by leadership programs should all have an understanding of what great leadership looks like. All the individuals, the thousands upon thousands who are not directly touched in going through, let’s say, a formal leadership-development intervention, they need to have a very clear understanding of what type of leadership works around there.', 'Simon London: And there, you’re talking about a leadership model, something that is explicit, that says, “For this organization, given our strategy, this is what good leadership looks like.” Is that right?', 'Claudio Feser: That’s a starting point. I think understanding what an organization needs, and what type of behaviors are desirable, is a starting point. There’s also what we believe is the first prerequisite for successful leadership-development programs at scale: an articulated perspective of, “What is our strategy? And what type of behaviors will enable that strategy, or help to implement that strategy?” That then defines the leadership model. But that’s just a starting point. It’s just one of the four things that we believe are critical to be able to develop leadership at scale.', 'Simon London: And give us the others. What are the other three?', 'Nicolai Nielsen: We did a lot of primary research for the book, trying to answer the questions around, “What constitutes effective leadership at scale? And how do you make that happen in an organization?” As Claudio mentioned, the first prerequisite is looking at the specific leadership behaviors, the specific shifts, that are needed to enable the strategy. Some organizations call it value. Some call it a competency model. But it is a relatively top-down set of behaviors that are needed to implement the strategy from a leadership point of view.', 'Simon London: And that’s the situational piece, right? Just to sort of make that clear. It’s like, “What’s going to work for us as an organization, given our context?”', 'Claudio Feser: Correct.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: Absolutely. That’s step one. The second prerequisite is then looking at who needs to be involved, and engaged very actively, in the leadership-development program. What we find is that you need to engage a critical mass of what we call “pivotal influencers.” It needs to be a critical mass of people in the organization who are engaged and who change the way that they lead in line with the leadership model.', 'Simon London: In practice, what is a critical mass?', 'Nicolai Nielsen: In practice, what we find is that around 5 to 15 percent of the pivotal influencers need to change the way they lead in order to affect the broader organization. The broader organization people, they change the way that they behave, given the context. And role modeling is a very powerful element of that context, especially role modeling by leaders. That can be superiors, leaders in the organization. But it can absolutely also be peers and subordinates who have an influential role, a visible role, in the organization, who the rest of the organization will take notice of.', 'Simon London:  OK, so that’s the second step. How many people you need to touch is the second key design question. What comes after that?', 'Nicolai Nielsen: We talked a bit about the what, a bit about the who. The third element is looking at, how do you architect the programs for behavioral change? What we find is you need to architect the programs with modern adult-learning principles, which are very much grounded in neuroscience, and grounded in how individuals learn and change behaviors.', 'Claudio Feser: People learn by solving difficult problems by themselves. That’s core in every leadership-development program. We try to get people being stretched and trying to solve challenging issues, challenging leadership situations—be that having courageous conversations, be that communicating better, be that executing better with their teams.', 'The way we do that is by not only giving them tough objectives and tough tasks but also helping them. We coach them. We mentor them. We give them opportunities to reflect on their behaviors in a guided way. That’s what best-practice adult learning is. And that’s what we try to apply in our work.', 'Simon London: But the key thing is, there are real projects going on through the leadership-development program. This is not just simulations. It’s not just sitting in a classroom.', 'Claudio Feser: We don’t invent problems. We ask them to consider their own problems. It might be making the budget this year. It might be entering a new market. It might be developing a new product. Whatever they are asked to do that is difficult, challenging, demanding for them, we focus on that. And we try to help them in their situation, in their real-life situation. When they go home and they try to solve a problem, they think about it. They try to find a new solution that they can apply the morning after. That’s when people learn. And that’s where we try to be.', 'Simon London: So that’s the third element, which is, how do you actually design the learning? How do you execute the learning? What’s the final piece of the puzzle?', 'Claudio Feser: The final piece of the puzzle is, you can’t ask people to change their behaviors if the systems in an organization are not supportive. If the incentive systems, if the leaders around you, if the narrative in the organization doesn’t support that, people won’t change their behaviors. We cannot ask them to better execute if, in the performance reviews, their superiors, the leaders who they report to, tell them a different story and say, “Oh, you need to be much more visionary.”', 'It is important that there is consistency in the systems supporting an organization. The communication by the leadership or top leadership, the incentive systems, the processes need to be able to support the desired behaviors that we want to see in leaders. When we spend time working with organizations on developing leadership at scale, we spend time trying to understand, what is the leader going through day by day? What behaviors is he or she expected to exercise, given the incentive systems, given the organizational structure, and given how leaders above him or her are leading?', 'Simon London: Is that typically around the human-resource performance-evaluation incentive structures? It sounds like that’s going to be a big component of this.', 'Claudio Feser: That’s absolutely a big component of that. We do look into performance management and then incentive systems. But we also look at the organizational structure and what type of behaviors the organizational structure needs to work effectively.', 'If you have a very functional organization, as an example, you need to work a lot on collaborative behaviors, so that you can reach out of your silo and talk to someone else in another silo and find a common solution. That is a leadership skill. That is a capability of operating in a functional, or say, matrix organization. Now, if you’re organized this way, we can spend a lot of time talking about how to manage the P&L [profit and loss] and how to execute top down. It won’t really work. So for us, it’s very important that an organizational structure, the operating model in which someone acts and behaves, is aligned with the behaviors that we’re trying to help develop.', 'Simon London: It can go well beyond the performance-evaluation system and how people fill in the forms and take the feedback?', 'Claudio Feser: That’s absolutely right. The performance evaluation, it’s where we start. We try to understand what it is. But we try to take a broader perspective.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: At the end of the day, we’re trying to set up the context to help enable leadership behaviors that are most desired and effective in that context. That does require quite a broad point of view. So as Claudio mentioned, performance evaluation is a starting point. But then, you look at the operating model. You look at the decision rights.', 'If you’re asking a leader to act in a certain way but not giving the authority to do that, that does not work. And even more broadly, we look at the context, because we know that individuals—both those on the programs themselves but also their colleagues—they also need to have the right context to shift how their behaviors actually are aligned. And that whole ecosystem is an extremely powerful determinate of the individual’s behavior. That looks at everything, from the communication to the role modeling to the performance management, the incentives, and the operating model.', 'Simon London: It sounds like a lot of work.', 'Claudio Feser: It is. But let me also say, though, that much of this work is being done anyway. This is more “aligning the stars,” if you so want. It’s making sure that when the performance-management system is being looked at, it is consistent with the behaviors we want to develop and that when leadership behaviors are being developed, we ensure that they’re aligned with strategy and context.', 'We actually believe that leadership at scale needs consistency over time. So it’s about aligning all of this and then letting the system take care of it over time. If these elements are done in a coherent and consistent way, over time the organization will build enough cadre over the next two to three years. It will build enough leadership capabilities for it to strive. This is not about developing three leaders, five leaders. This is about developing hundreds of leaders over a period of time. It needs to be thorough. It needs to be consistent.', 'Simon London: You mentioned two to three years. I know that was a bit of throwaway. But that sounds like a reasonable horizon over which to expect significant, measurable changes across the organization as a whole.', 'Claudio Feser: Yes. Let me say that the setup work might be, between diagnosis and design and implementation, three or four months. It might not take that much time. But the process needs to run. It’s almost like an annual process that is being set up and that needs to run a few times by itself. It doesn’t need work, per se. The work has been done by setting it up. But the process needs to take hold and run a few times for the organization to start to build enough cadres that it can say it has built leadership at scale.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: We also do talk about the notion of pace in the book. And, especially when you have real transformations, what we do see is that it’s often very helpful for the initial rollout to be quick, and for people down the line to begin to see and feel the change. That doesn’t mean that the program is fully implemented.', 'But if you take the reverse, if people don’t begin to see or feel a change after 12 to 18 months, then they also might begin to question the program: “How is this going to help us change in the context of the transformation?” So I think it’s a balance of having a long-term view of saying, “over two to three years, we will begin to fundamentally shift how we lead.” But at the beginning, there’s also an element of pace, and moving fast, and beginning to show the change up front.', 'Simon London: I think the obvious question, if I put myself in the shoes of a CEO, is: “Why should I invest in this, versus other things that I could invest in? It could be anything, from acquisitions to more product development to a lean implementation program. All of the above. Why should I invest in leadership development at scale?”', 'Claudio Feser: Our research shows that organizations going through a transformation program, be that an organizational transformation, be that a digital transformation, be that an application of new technology-based transformation, will be significantly more successful if they concurrently invest in building leaders. Those with leadership-development interventions will be 2.4 times more successful than those that do not develop their leaders during a transformation.', 'So given the pace of change that organizations are going through these days, given the fact that basically everyone is in one or the other transformation as we speak, organizations that do not invest in leadership-development interventions will simply have a higher probability of failing, as opposed to those that do work on their leaders, do work on fostering awareness and behaviors, and help leaders amplify their repertoires of how they lead.', 'Simon London: So it’s not an “or,” it’s an “and.” It’s not, “Should I do digital transformation, or leadership development, or a lean implementation and leadership development?” It’s, you can likely be more successful if you do both of these?', 'Claudio Feser: Correct.', 'Simon London: Just to be devil’s advocate, the other thing that strikes me is, it takes a number of years for this really to take root, take hold, and change leadership behaviors at scale across an organization. On the other hand, we hear a lot that the pace of change is such that the organizational context for all the companies is changing almost on an annual basis.', 'So if I’m a CEO, I could invest in this. It’s almost like a build versus buy. I could build my own leaders from within. Or I could try and hire people in with the kind of leadership behaviors and skills that I think are going to be more effective for now and for the future. What’s your advice to a CEO going through that thought process?', 'Claudio Feser: That’s very often the case, that we are engaged in this conversation. How much do you develop versus how much do you buy? And while the context is different, I think as a rule, let me say the following: it is always a combination of both. But the extent to which you want to go external: it obviously has an opportunity in that it is faster, in terms of fostering the leadership behaviors, but you also lose a lot of history. You also lose a lot of experience and understanding of the organization and of the industry. And therefore it’s always a question of what the right balance is. It depends a little bit from the practice. But in practice, it will always be a combination of both.', 'Simon London: So in reality, a kind of “rip and replace” strategy, where you’re taking out a whole layer of the organization, trying to bring new people in …', 'Claudio Feser: Seldomly works.', 'Simon London: … seldomly works, right. So I think that’s all we have time for today. But Claudio and Nicolai, thanks so much for being here.', 'Claudio Feser: Thank you for having us.', 'Nicolai Nielsen: It was a pleasure.', 'Simon London: And thanks as always to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

Whether telcos can capture the value is less clear.,"['Next-generation mobile networks promise lower latency and higher speeds. Whether telcos can capture the value is less clear.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Ferry Grijpink and Philipp Nattermann—ahead of the headline telecommunications conference Mobile World Congress (MWC). They discuss which players will be the biggest winners and losers as 5G starts to starts to roll out.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Mobile-phone networks are among the technological marvels of our age. Yes, we might complain from time to time about dropped calls, but let’s be honest: the ability to browse, stream, upload, navigate, and even shop from our phones is nothing short of remarkable. And there’s more to come in the form of 5G networks, which promise to open up whole new sets of applications. But who makes money from this abundance of innovation and investment? The answer, as we’ll hear, is complicated. Suffice it to say that the winner is not always the telco to which you pay your monthly bill. To discuss the economics of this fascinating industry, I sat down in London with Philipp Nattermann and Ferry Grijpink, two McKinsey partners who work extensively with clients across the telecom sector. Philipp and Ferry, thanks for being here, and welcome to the podcast.', 'Philipp Nattermann: Great to be here.', 'Ferry Grijpink: Happy to be here.', 'Simon London: So from a consumer perspective, clearly we’re in a bit of a golden age for mobile. We’re streaming. We’re navigating. We’re doing a lot of things from our cell phones we just couldn’t do before. Step back, if you don’t mind, Philipp. Give a sense of the growth of the industry. How fast is data consumption over mobile growing?', 'Philipp Nattermann: It is growing enormously. If you look at some of the numbers in Europe, data consumption has grown sixfold between 2010 and 2017. I think it’s actually growing even faster if you look at different forecasts. A key reason for that is the ubiquitous availability of 4G, both handsets and networks.', 'With the new services like you mentioned—of streaming applications, et cetera—telcos cover more people than electricity today. It is a truly ubiquitous product. The forecasts really are that it will only continue to grow. Depending on whose numbers you believe, something like north of 75 percent of all the mobile traffic today is already video.', 'That is also the fastest growing both in terms of how much video gets uploaded to the YouTubes and so on of the world on a daily basis and in consumption. My expectation is that the growth we have seen will only accelerate over the next three to five years.', 'Ferry Grijpink: If you look at growth, [you see] the availability of very cheap devices in many, many markets. I work a lot in Africa, where you suddenly have phones that are $50 or even $20, which enables many people to have phones, and you create so many interesting applications on top of it. The value generated by mobile phones for society and for people is so big that we’re really living in a golden age of these opportunities. The better the network becomes, the more it’s feasible. That also makes it more exciting.', 'With a 2G phone, you could do SMS. But now, suddenly, you can do taxi booking. You can manage your bank account. You can even look at your crop. Is my crop doing well? Can I get advice? Get some medical advice. The value of cheap smartphones in emerging markets is phenomenal, and the value created for the individual and for society is tremendous.', 'Simon London: From a company perspective and from an industry perspective, the interesting question is: Who’s capturing the value? Give us a sense of where the value is flowing today.', 'Philipp Nattermann: I think “it depends” is the answer. As Ferry mentioned earlier, there is still unbelievable growth in the pure telco industry. On a regional level, if you look at free cash flow as a proxy for that, it increased by about 100 percent in North America between 2007 and 2017 and at a similar rate in Korea and in Japan, for example. 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r             Based on a sample of companies across regions, looking at the differences between earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization and capital expenditure.\\r               \\r \\r  There’s been growth.', 'There are some markets, like Europe, that are shrinking. That’s probably due to competitive market structure more than anything else. But that’s only part of what I as a consumer spend and you as a consumer spend, which is your monthly phone bill.', 'The second bit, which is, if you look at devices, particularly at the high end in the mature market, some phones cost north of $1,000 at this point. There has been a huge amount of value creation and value shift toward the technology players that create these devices.', 'The third pool, which is probably the biggest opportunity, is the services and applications on top of that, be that the streaming, be that the entertaining, or any other types of services, which require both the ubiquitous networks and the smartphones, be they low end or high end. Those are the three different types of players in the industry that are seeing quite different value flows and quite different trajectories at this point.', 'Simon London: So telcos have done well, Europe aside, but maybe not quite as well as some of the device manufacturers, naming no names, and some of the technology companies. They’ve probably done even better out of 4G and this growth.', 'Ferry Grijpink: If you take a step backward, Philipp described these three buckets of value. You see that the equipment manufacturers who deliver the network, they’ve consolidated. When I graduated there were 15 or so. We’re now at four or five left. If you look at the device manufacturers, there may be five or six globally, but only one or two make money. But they’re global industries.', 'The telcos are largely a local industry, so they compete locally. And they’ve done relatively well in their local markets, but once they start to compete on the global scale—for example, for services—it becomes more difficult. That triggered a bit of an identity crisis. Because before, they did everything from calling to SMS, and they provided a lot of tech services and connectivity.', 'Now, suddenly, they’re boxed into this connectivity area. If you try to compete with global players without the R&D, without the developers, and without the ten-year horizon, profitability is very difficult. Therefore a lot of telcos outside of Europe have done really well but not as well as the big global services providers and internet companies. And there’s a realization of, “What is my business? And how can I be successful in this game?”', 'Simon London: It’s funny from a layperson’s perspective to think of mobile operators almost like utilities because the technology is pretty amazing.', 'Ferry Grijpink: The technology is fascinating. Indeed, I was in Myanmar, and you can literally have a FaceTime call with your parents in the Netherlands. It’s just phenomenal. At the same time, of course, only a small part of that is the telco. You’ve got the equipment manufacturing, the R&D chipset people, which are all needed to make it happen. [The telco is] an orchestrator of the chain more than an innovator in the chain.', 'That orchestration’s really important because you need to run base stations. You need to fuel them. You need to make sure they work. That is not easy business. But at the same time, they’re an important part of but not the total value chain.', 'Philipp Nattermann: I think you’re absolutely right. If you think about it, as a telco, I buy all the equipment. I buy the phones. It has, thanks to GSMA 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             GSM Association.\\r               \\r \\r  and others, been standardized. If you’re a telco, it’s also quite hard to really differentiate yourself because we can all buy the same phones. We can all buy the same equipment.', 'Yes, some are larger, so you have more money. You can build a better network. But it’s very different than most other industries where I run my own R&D. Telcos have outsourced it. That’s one of the key issues where when you do have a slightly less favorable industry structure, like we have in Europe for example, then it’s very, very hard for the players to overcome that.', 'That’s one of the things that, if you think back over the last 20 years, has changed quite significantly. I remember there were players who tried to have their own smartphones, who tried to have their own early versions of a walled garden. We all remember NTT Docomo’s examples 15 years ago or so.', 'Simon London: Just double-click on the industry-structure point. By that, basically, we mean how many players are competing for market share in any given market?', 'Philipp Nattermann: It is that and more. So, yes, of course. Look at a market like the US, where I have four players or four scale players, in effect, in mobile, for example, maybe even going down now to three. Compare it to a market like the UK, which is, from a population standpoint, something like a quarter or a fifth of that [market]? But, again, I have four players. Now, I have a smaller landmass that I need to cover with my cells. But I lack scale economies. And I think Europe, as Ferry mentioned earlier, is particularly separated. I need a local operating license. [The European Union] has 26, 27 countries? Roughly it’s the size of the US in aggregate. But I have 26 to 27 times as many local operators as the US has. That, by definition, puts Europe at a scale disadvantage.', 'Ferry Grijpink: I work with a lot of regulators in Asia and Africa to look at regulatory regimes. If you take the two opposite perspectives, there is a perspective around, “How do I protect the consumer?” Because do you need a local operating license, or is consumer protection needed? At the same time, you want to make sure there is investment and there is basically good infrastructure. And it’s a balancing act.', 'By far and large the European Union did a pretty good job in making sure that the consumers have low cost for connectivity. Now we’re on the verge of a large rollout of new infrastructure like 5G. Then the question is a bit, “Is there enough money, and is there enough value in the pool for an operator to roll out faster?” Getting that balance right between consumer protection and investment protection is difficult. At different times and in different markets, governments played differently and therefore you see different outcomes.', 'Simon London: So that’s a really nice segue into 5G. Ferry, for a nonspecialist like me, what is 5G, when’s it coming, and what’s it going to enable?', 'Ferry Grijpink: 5G is just the next evolution of the mobile network. We started out with 2G, then 3G, 4G. Now we have 5G. 5G does three big things. One is it enables much faster speed. We’re talking about gigabits a second that you can deliver. The second is it cuts down latency. So it’ll go faster. Between setting up the connection and receiving something, things go faster. And that’s quite important: if you want to steer a robot, that robot reacts very quickly in what you do. A third one is it enables a lot of IoT [Internet of Things] use cases. Much lower power. Those are the three big things 5G is enabling.', 'We predicted it would launch after 2020 [Exhibit 1]. Right now we see many players planning to launch commercially in 2019. And, of course, in the US, there are a lot of very advanced trials already going on this year.', '', 'Simon London: I was going to say I see quite a lot of headlines that mention 5G as if it’s literally just going to hit me as a consumer.', 'Ferry Grijpink: Well, we expect handsets to be available at the end of 2019. So in the end, you will be able to buy a handset then. Maybe not from the big brand one but from smaller brands. At the same time, as a consumer, will you notice faster speed on your phone? Most likely not. Will you see a lot of the latency benefits for yourself? No.', 'For 5G, we are looking for different use cases. Things like Industry 4.0. We talk about cars. We talk other applications. And in that respect, 5G resembles a lot 3G. When the operators in Europe were rolling out 3G in 2003 and 2004, they built a beautiful, shiny network that could do a lot of high-speed data. Nobody had any idea what to do with it at that point of time.', 'It took them until 2007, when the iPhone came, to realize that is the application. Smartphone is the thing. It’s not going to be wireless broadband. It’s really that as a use case. What we see now is we’re rolling out a network with a much better capability. And the question is: Who can innovate on that capability to really offset demand?', 'We see a lot of trials in factories. I was in a refinery to look at how robots can connect faster. But the big thing, that iPhone moment, hasn’t happened for 5G yet.', 'Philipp Nattermann: The game changer, if it comes, will come from IoT applications, Industry 4.0 applications.', 'How do I connect a car? Take that as an example. Clearly you have the car manufacturers. You have the existing map producers and all these things, the OEMs, the service providers. They will create a lot of use cases. They largely will retain the information.', 'Take your car, in terms of predictive maintenance. If you drive—whatever it is, a Fiat, a BMW—the car manufacturer will own a lot of this. Clearly I will use a mobile operator’s network to transmit that. If I want to do autonomous vehicles, I need the low latency. To get to this eureka moment, I believe, it will be very important for the operators to collaborate with these different vertical players, be that automotive, be that robotics, be that logistics, be that financial services.', 'If you’re honest, the one thing the telco industry has not been particularly good at is effectively collaborating with third parties. We’re very good within the industry in terms of finding standards. That’s very impressive. But if you’re really honest, how well have you worked with financial services? How well have you worked with the medical-device industry, the automotive industry? Not that well. But that’s where the value will come from.', 'One of the things that the operators really need to start thinking about is: How do we avoid the mistakes of the past to enable the industry to capture its fair share of the value that will undoubtedly be created by 5G?', 'Simon London: Yes, that’s the big takeaway for me. As I started researching this, I, as a layperson, hadn’t realized to what extent the industry had failed—and maybe “failed” is too strong a word—but failed to capture a lot of the value created out of 3G and 4G. That has to be the really interesting strategic question for telcos now.', 'We know there’s going to be a lot of value created through 5G. We don’t know exactly what yet, but there’s going to be stuff created. There’s going to be value created out of 5G. How do you have a real seat at the table? How do you partner? What are the business models? What are the alliances, the ecosystems to actually capture value? Is that a fair summation?', 'Ferry Grijpink: MGI [the McKinsey Global Institute], our think tank, thinks it will be about $4 trillion to $11 trillion of value created by IoT. It’s unclear if that’s going to be captured by the industry or it’s going to be consumer surplus. But it’s a large number to look at. When we looked at this for a lot of our clients, around 10 to 30 percent of that requires advanced network capabilities. Things like low latency, very high reliability, very high speeds, that give the telcos some right to play because they bring that capability sometimes earlier and more integrated than other players.', 'At the same time, a right to play is not the same as a right to win. A right to win, to Philipp’s point, means that you need to understand the vertical. You need to be able to partner with device manufacturers, with people who operate refineries, people who understand pumps, who build the solution. The question is, as a regional player or a local player, how do you inject yourself in that ecosystem to generate value?', 'Some local use cases, like smart cities, healthcare-related stuff, are easier for telcos to capture because there’s a local regulatory aspect. They need to be reinvented at a local-market scale. While things like Industry 4.0 will be more difficult because some of that will be more global.', 'Simon London: And, of course, the other thing about 5G, like any of these technology transitions, is the cost of the build-out of the new network. I know 5G has some particular wrinkles in it. For example, you need denser towers to make it work. Philipp, what is it going to cost? Who’s going to come up with the money? Are they going to make a return?', 'Philipp Nattermann: I think, yes, it’s absolutely right that, especially for the higher-frequency bands, the density of the network is significantly higher, probably an order of magnitude higher, than it was for 4G or 3G, particularly in urban areas.', 'Simon London: So literally more towers per square kilometer in these areas.', 'Philipp Nattermann: Yes. For the high frequency, which is really what gives you the high capacity, particularly in urban areas, as Ferry had mentioned earlier, 4G is starting to run out of capacity [Exhibit 2]. A big part of the business case for many operators is the increased capacity you get from your networks. Forget about the IoT stuff. But that’s the very first stuff.', '', 'The equipment prices are already starting to come down. The key challenge really is what I would call the civil-engineering cost for each of the new cell sites. It won’t necessarily be a massive, big tower, it might be a microsite. But you still need to build the site, get planning permission for the site, have fiber backhaul because the whole idea is: I have much higher capacity in my cells. Well, I need to somehow bring it back to my core network. Players who have an existing fiber network will actually have a greater advantage relative to other players.', 'Part two is, in a number of markets, you are not allowed to build incremental cell sites in urban areas either because of the radio-emissions constraints, or because of building constraints, for example.', 'So there are real questions about, especially in European metropolitan areas, whether it will be physically feasible under the current regulatory regime to build the density of the networks that you would need for 5G to work.', 'What we are starting to see already is different players thinking about network sharing [Exhibit 3]—pooling their networks together, either what we call the passive, or the sort of infrastructure part, or the active part—and that will very likely continue. It is clearly a cost element, but it is also a sheer, “I need access to a larger number of sites. You have some sites. I have some sites. If we combine them, it gets us both a long way down the road.”', '', 'Simon London: So, Philipp, you said “orders of magnitude.” How many base stations are we going to need in an urban area? Give us a sense of what that means in practice.', 'Philipp Nattermann: It really depends on the topography. But typically, in an urban area, [you can have up to 30 to 45 sites] per square kilometer.', 'Simon London: And these are towers today.', 'Philipp Nattermann: These are towers or smaller cell sites that you see on the side of buildings. On 5G, again, it depends on the take-up. It depends how much spectrum you get as an operator, et cetera. But we could talk an order of magnitude, so [up to] hundreds per square kilometer of cell sites.', 'What that means is, on street furniture, on lampposts. One of the operators in Europe developed a method to put a cell in the underside of a manhole cover. This gives you a sense of the sheer number of cell sites they will need in big urban areas but also in the length to which operators are being forced to think about, “Well, where do I actually attach this cell site?” Be that in street furniture, be that elsewhere, [they will need] to be able to place potentially hundreds of cells in a single square kilometer.', 'Simon London: And when you talk about the civil-engineering challenge, that’s what we’re talking about. It’s not like building a big bridge, but the complexity of rolling out 5G, particularly in urban areas, is significant. [See [Exhibit 4] for a look at increasing network density.]', '', 'Philipp Nattermann: Yes. It’s the distributed nature of it. Most European cities or North American or Asian cities were not built for 5G. They were built for very different purposes. So, yes, I think it will be a huge challenge. And I think you might very easily see a greater bifurcation of operators.', 'If I’m a well-financed operator, maybe even the incumbent, I have a fixed infrastructure in place, that’s one thing. If I’m a relatively small mobile-only player with significantly fewer resources, this challenge becomes significantly more daunting. We could very well see that 5G might lead to some changes in industry structure.', 'Simon London: This is why you said it may not make sense to have multiple networks. It may make sense just to have a single network, just like you have a single set of water pipes and a single set of electricity cables. Because the civil-engineering challenge becomes such that you just need a single layer of these base stations?', 'Ferry Grijpink: One of the analysts always jokes that telcos are specialized real-estate companies because, frankly, rent you need to pay for all these hundreds of towers is pretty high. It’s like being a real-estate developer. What you see in 5G, there are certain regulators who are willing to give out licenses for a region. You get a neutral host.', 'So instead of five players trying to cover this area, only one covers it and people roam on it. It’s very controversial in the industry. How do you create enough competition? How do you not create certain rent extraction? But in the licensing regime of 5G, certain markets are going that way.', 'Simon London: And then you really get to a model that begins to look more like a utility, don’t you? And this is one of the issues for the industry. You only have one set of water pipes, and there’s a utility, basically. And there are certain regulatory regimes that allow a degree of competition. You can choose your electricity provider, for example, in many places. But they’re all going across a single transmission network. Doesn’t the industry begin, again, to look more like a utility?', 'Ferry Grijpink: I think regulators would like to prevent that happening. Because what we see in the industry, in places where you had cable and fixed, you saw much more innovation. Fixed players were much more incentivized to upgrade their networks to VDSL, 3    \\r             3.\\r          \\r             Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line. \\r               \\r \\r  to fiber. And cables were running faster to provide upgrades to DOCSIS. 4    \\r             4.\\r          \\r             Data-over-cable service interface specifications.', 'So a situation of one network I think would be counterproductive toward innovation and rolling out things fast. At the same time, do you want to have five base stations crammed in historic city centers in Europe? No. So there’s most likely an optimum, which is somewhere between two and four depending on the scale of the economy, depending on the size.', 'Simon London: OK. So different solutions for different geographic areas. And there are good reasons for competition. There are good competition reasons why we might not want to see the industry develop into too much of this utility model.', 'Philipp Nattermann: I agree. I think, to be honest, again, this is primarily a European issue, which you talked about before. If you compare prices of telcos—so what does the average consumer pay, let’s call it a price—and you look at it over ten years, for telcos this has come down even though we use way, way, way more data today than we ever did before. All other utilities have increased their prices even though people tend to use less electricity today because we’ve become more energy efficient, and probably use about as much water as you did, and so on.', 'So I’m not sure that the telcos would necessarily mind being treated like utilities if you look at that in terms of being able to raise prices, to have a regulatory-protected environment. Utility might be a bit of a dirty word, but in reality, it may not be such a bad thing.', 'Simon London: That’s right. A good regulator would make sure they could at least earn their cost of capital, which in Europe, I gather, is not the case if you take the industry aggregate.', 'Philipp Nattermann: Absolutely. We’ve looked at this across a range of European countries. Clearly there will always be players that do. But across the core seven large European markets, the industry not only does not meet its cost of capital, the return on capital is lower than its cost of capital. In pure economic terms, this is value destructive and has been for the last three or four years. And I think that is a real concern for the industry. It goes back to a point we discussed earlier, which is, in Europe, regulators have been very good at lowering endconsumer prices, which has an impact on the revenue and on the returns that these players have had.', 'The flip side of this is, if my cost of capital is higher than the return I generate, that, among rational economic players, will have an impact in terms of reducing the investments I will make. There is a real risk that Europe might fall behind. I think we can claim that it definitely was leading in 2G. No question about that. Maybe even early 3G.', 'But if you look at network density, if you look at the speed of 5G rollout, you could claim that certain markets in Asia, for example, maybe even the US, are on par, if not ahead of, Europe. One of the key reasons for that is the different economic climate. That is one of the concerns I would have, at least, that if this continues and the industry continues to fail to generate a return that at least meets its cost of capital, forget about exceeding it, we might see slower investments. We might see headline rollouts of 5G in London, Paris, or Milan. That’s all great. But who will actually have it? How much will it be available, at what cost relative to some of the other markets out there?', 'Ferry Grijpink: And, Philipp, this is not just a European phenomenon. If you look at what happened in India, on one hand, there are grateful consumers because data prices went down and there was massive adoption. But at the same time, the industry is starved of profits. And the question is: What will that mean going forward? There are other markets, like Indonesia, that are also very similar. Very competitive. And the question is: If all the players are experiencing losses at the moment, will that generate enough cash to keep innovating and keep building new infrastructure?', 'Simon London: As we’re recording this, everybody’s preparing for MWC at the end of February in Europe, in Barcelona. As you mentioned, Philipp, the industry in Europe faces particular challenges around industry structure and profitability. What needs to change? How can that be fixed? And how do we make sure that Europe doesn’t fall behind, doesn’t end up with a tech deficit in this area?', 'Philipp Nattermann: European regulators have been very good at keeping end-customer prices low. They have been less good at creating an environment where the return on capital is sufficient to cover the cost of capital. What that means is we need to start thinking about how we allow more in-market consolidation because we clearly see that the number of players has a very clear inverse correlation to profitability. European operators are significantly less profitable than their North American, their Korean, or their Japanese counterparts.', 'Simon London: And consolidation, in practical terms, means M&A.', 'Philipp Nattermann: It means M&A. Or, alternatively, you allow for moving away from what is a sort of accident of history, that these relatively small countries in Europe each has its own licensing requirements, and instead saying, “I allow you to run a network across the whole Benelux region,” for example, or the DACH region or whatever it is, so that you help operators get more economies of scale. Because, obviously, a large market is able to support a larger number of competitors than a small market. So I think there is clearly something around that. And I think the commission and the regulators really need to think about, what is the long-term vision? Because, yes, of course, they can keep continuing to just focus on low-end customer pricing. But that will over the long term [have an impact].', 'There’s a second element, if you look at what we talked about before: the other players, the newer players in the value chain that have captured most of the value, particularly on the OTT, which is “over the top,” the service providers that sit on top of the telcos. This is the Netflixes, the Googles, all your applications that you run. Very few people still talk on their phone much. It’s mostly all the applications. If I look at those, they’re almost exclusively North American. At the same time, you have, which is less visible to us, maybe, but you have a similar ecosystem being created in China. The question is, what are the things we can do in Europe—and that we should do—to ensure that we have an equally rich pipeline of these innovative companies?', 'Because my thought is, as we look at the value migration, more and more of the value will migrate to the application—and the simple reason being that the number of applications you can provide is limitless and the number of networks I can have is, by definition, limited. This goes from taxation to risk capital to setting up the environment where we don’t just grow start-ups—and anybody who goes to MWC sees a huge number of very small start-ups—but actually create tech companies that can play on the same level as the big players in either the US or in China. And I think that’s almost the bigger concern in all of this.', 'Ferry Grijpink: Philipp, if I may build on the point you’re making but take a slightly different lens, I think there are three other elements we need to consider for Europe telcos. Number one is the consumer. In the transition from being the integrated service provider to being more connectivity providers, we lost the consumer.', 'If you ask a consumer, “Who would you rather deal with? Do you want to give your information to one of the service providers like Google or Facebook?” They would rather give their information to them than to [telcos]. One element to focus on as an operator, to stay relevant and play in the application space, is to win back the minds and heart of the consumers.', 'Second, if you look at where we are in the development of connectivity and applications, we’re moving from virtualized goods like social networks and content into the hard physical space with IoT. And there, of course, Europe has a lot of advantages. We know how to run industries. We’re a manufacturing hub like in Germany. We produce a lot of goods. So once applications move from the virtual space to the physical space, the question is: Do we have an advantage in Europe?', 'The third thing is we also have a little bit of an advantage given the fact that we don’t have one of the large players here. Things like GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation], privacy, how we are going to create these new platforms that are more focused on what consumers want now—I think we saw all the problems with decentralized platforms. Given that we have none of them in Europe, we have the opportunity to win one.', 'Those are some positives to look at where we can build on. But it requires the industry to make real bets and to go after one thing, not a hundred things at the same time, and really focus. If we try as every individual nation and every individual operator to go after the same thing, we will fail.', 'Simon London: So I think we’re out of time today, but Philipp, Ferry, thank you very much for a fascinating conversation.', 'Philipp Nattermann: Thank you.', 'Ferry Grijpink: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And thanks as always to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

73,AI Ethics in today’s world,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics-podcast,Executives and companies can enjoy the benefits of artificial intelligence while also being aware of potential drawbacks and taking careful steps to mitigate their effects.,"['Executives and companies can enjoy the benefits of artificial intelligence while also being aware of potential drawbacks and taking careful steps to mitigate their effects.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey Global Institute partner Michael Chui and partner Chris Wigley about the emerging field of AI ethics and the key steps companies can take to ethically deploy artificial intelligence.', 'Podcast transcript', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be talking about the ethics of artificial intelligence. At the highest level, is it ethical to use AI to enable, say, mass surveillance or autonomous weapons? On the flip side, how can AI be used for good, to tackle pressing societal challenges? And in day-today business, how can companies deploy AI in ways that ensure fairness, transparency, and safety? To discuss these issues, I sat down with Michael Chui and Chris Wigley. Michael is a partner with the McKinsey Global Institute and has led multiple research projects on the impact of AI on business and society. Chris is both a McKinsey partner and chief operating officer at QuantumBlack, a London-based analytics company that uses AI extensively in his work with clients. Chris and Michael, welcome to the podcast.', 'Chris Wigley: Great to be here.', 'Michael Chui: Terrific to join you.', 'Simon London: This is a big, hairy topic. Why don’t we start with the broadest of broad brush questions which is, “Are we right to be concerned?” Is the ethics of AI something—whether you’re a general manager or a member of the public—that we should be concerned about?', 'Chris Wigley: Yes, I think the simple answer to this is that the concerns are justified. We are right to worry about the ethical implications of AI. Equally, I think we need to celebrate some of the benefits of AI. The high-level question is, “How do we get the balance right between those benefits and the risks that go along with them?”', 'On the benefit side, we can already see hundreds of millions, even billions of people using and benefiting from AI today. It’s important we don’t forget that. Across all of their daily use in search and things like maps, health technology, assistants like Siri and Alexa, we’re all benefiting a lot from the convenience and the enhanced decision-making powers that AI brings us.', 'But on the flip side, there are justifiable concerns around jobs that arise from automation of roles that AI enables, from topics like autonomous weapons, the impact that some AI-enabled spaces and forums can have on the democratic process, and even things emerging like deep fakes, which is video created via AI which looks and sounds like your president or a presidential candidate or a prime minister or some kind of public figure saying things that they have never said. All of those are risks we need to manage. But at the same time we need to think about how we can enable those benefits to come through.', 'Michael Chui: To add to what Chris was saying, you can think about ethics in two ways. One is this is an incredibly powerful tool. It’s a general-purpose technology—people have called it—and one question is, “For what purposes do you want to use it?” Do you want to use it for good or for ill?', 'There’s a question about what the ethics of that are. But again, you can use this tool for doing good things, for improving people’s health. You can also use it to hurt people in various ways. That’s one level of questions.', 'I think there’s a separate level of questions which are equally important. Once you’ve decided perhaps I’m going to use it for a good purpose, I’m going to try to improve people’s health, the other ethical question is, “In the execution of trying to use it for good, are you also doing the right ethical things?”', 'Sometimes you could have unintended consequences. You can inadvertently introduce bias in various ways despite your intention to use it for good. You need to think about both levels of ethical questions.', 'Simon London: Michael, I know you just completed some research into the use of AI for good. Give us an overview. What did you find when you looked at that?', 'Michael Chui: One of the things that we were looking at was how could you direct this incredibly powerful set of tools to improving social good. We looked at 160 different individual potential cases of AI to improve social good, everything from improving healthcare and public health around the world to improving disaster recovery [Exhibit 1]. Looking at the ability to improve financial inclusion, all of these things.', 'For pretty much every one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, there are a set of use cases where AI can actually help improve some of our progress towards reaching those Sustainable Development Goals.', 'Simon London: Give us some examples. What are a couple of things? Bring it to life.', '', 'Michael Chui: Some of the things that AI is particularly good at—or the new generations of AI are particularly good at—are analyzing images, for instance. That has broad applicability. Take, for example, diagnosing skin cancer. One thing you could imagine doing is taking a mobile phone and uploading an image and training an AI system to say, “Is this likely to be skin cancer or not?”', 'There aren’t dermatologists everywhere in the world where you might want to diagnose skin cancer. So being able to do that, and again, the technology is not perfect yet, but can we just improve our accessibility to healthcare through this technology?', 'On a very different scale, we have huge amounts of satellite imagery. The entire world’s land mass is imaged in some cases several times a day. In a disaster situation, it can be very difficult in the search for humans, to be able to identify which buildings are still there, which healthcare facilities are still intact, where are there passable roads, where aren’t there passable roads.', 'We’ve seen the ability to use artificial-intelligence technology, particularly deep learning, be able to very quickly, much more quickly than a smaller set of human beings, identify these features on satellite imagery, and then be able to divert or allocate resources, emergency resources, whether it’s healthcare workers, whether it’s infrastructure construction workers, to better allocate those resources more quickly in a disaster situation.', 'Simon London: So disaster response, broadly speaking—there’s a whole set of cases around that.', 'Michael Chui: Absolutely. It’s a place where speed is of the essence. When these automated machines using AI are able to accelerate our ability to deploy resources, it can be incredibly impactful.', 'Chris Wigley: One of the things that I find most exciting about this is linking that to our dayto-day work as well. So we’ve had a QuantumBlack team, for example, working with a city over the last few months recovering from a major gas explosion on the outskirts of that city. That’s really helped to accelerate the recovery of that infrastructure for the city, helped the families who are affected by that, helped the infrastructure like schools and so on, using a mix of the kinds of imagery techniques that Michael’s spoken about.', 'Also there’s the commuting patterns—the communications data that you can aggregate to look at how people travel around the city and so on to optimize the work of those teams who are doing the disaster recovery.', 'We’ve also deployed these kinds of machine-learning techniques to look at things like, “What are the root causes of people getting addicted to opioids? And what might be some of the most effective treatments?” to things like the spread of disease in epidemiology, looking at the spread of diseases like measles in Croatia.', 'Those are all things that we’ve been a part of in the last 12 months, often on a pro bono basis, bringing these technologies to life to really solve concrete societal problems.', 'Simon London: The other thing that strikes me in the research is that very often you are dealing with more vulnerable populations when you’re dealing with some of these societal-good issues. So yes, there are many ways in which you can point AI at these societal issues, but the risks in implementation are potentially higher because the people involved are in some sense vulnerable.', 'Michael Chui: I think we find that to be the case. Sometimes AI can improve social good by identifying vulnerable populations. But in some cases that might hurt the people that you’re trying to help the most. Because when you’re identifying vulnerable populations, then sometimes bad things can happen to them, whether it’s discrimination or acts of malicious intent.', 'To that second level that we talked about before, how you actually implement AI within a specific use case also brings to mind a set of ethical questions about how that should be done. That’s as true in for-profit cases as it for not-profit cases. That’s as true in commercial cases as it is in AI for social good.', 'Simon London: Let’s dive deeper on those risks then, whether you’re in a for-profit or a not-for-profit environment. What are the main risks and ethical issues related to the deployment, AI in action?', 'Chris Wigley: One of the first we should touch on is around bias and fairness. We find it helpful to think about this in three levels, the first being bias itself. We might think about this where a data set that we’re drawing on to build a model doesn’t reflect the population that the model will be applied to or used for.', 'There have been various controversies around facial-recognition software not working as well for women, for people of color, because it’s been trained on a biased data set which has too many white guys in it. There are various projects afoot to try and address that kind of issue. That’s the first level, which is bias. Does the data set reflect the population that you’re trying to model?', 'You then get into fairness which is a second level. Saying, “Look, even if the data set that we’re drawing on to build this model accurately reflects history, what if that history was by its nature unfair?” An example domain here is around predictive policing. Even if the data set accurately reflects a historical reality or a population, are the decisions that we make on top of that fair?', 'Then the final one is [about whether the use of data is] unethical. Are there data sets and models that we could build and deploy which could just be turned to not just unfair but unethical ends? We’ve seen debates on this between often the very switched on employees of some of the big tech firms and some of the work that those tech firms are looking at doing.', 'Different groups’ definitions of unethical will be different. But thinking about it at those three levels of, one: bias. Does the data reflect the population? Two: fairness. Even if it does, does that mean that we should continue that in perpetuity? And three: unethical. “Are there things that these technologies can do which we should just never do?” is a helpful of way of separating some of those issues.', 'Michael Chui: I think Chris brings up a really important point. We often hear about this term algorithmic bias. That suggests that the software engineer embeds their latent biases or blatant biases into the rules of the computer program. While that is something to guard against, the more insidious and perhaps more common for this type of technology is the biases that might be latent within the data sets as Chris was mentioning.', 'Some of that comes about sometimes because it’s the behavior of people who are biased and therefore you see it. Arrest records being biased against certain racial groups would be an example. Sometimes it just comes about because of the way that we’ve collected the data.', 'That type of subtlety is really important. It’s not just about making sure that the software engineer isn’t biased. You really need to understand the data deeply if you’re going to understand whether there’s bias there.', 'Simon London: Yes, I think there’s that famous example of potholes in Boston I think it was using the accelerometers in smart phones to identify when people are driving, do they go over potholes. The problem with that at the time that this data was collected is that a lot of the more disadvantaged populations didn’t have smart phones. So there was more data on potholes in rich neighborhoods. 1    \\r             1.\\r          \\r              The Street Bump program is not in active use by the city of Boston.', 'Chris Wigley: There’s a bunch of other risks that we also need to take into account. If the bias and fairness gives us an ethical basis for thinking about this, we also face very practical challenges and risks in this technology. So, for example, at QuantumBlack, we do a lot of work in the pharmaceutical industry. We’ve worked on topics like patient safety in clinical trials. Once we’re building these technologies into the workflows of people who are making decisions in clinical trials about patient safety, we have to be really, really thoughtful about the resilience of those models in operation, how those models inform the decision making of human beings but don’t replace it, so we keep a human in the loop, how we ensure that the data sources that feed into that model continue to reflect the reality on the ground, and that those models get retrained over time and so on.', 'In those kinds of safety critical or security critical applications, this becomes absolutely essential. We might add to this areas like critical infrastructure, like electricity networks and smart grids, airplanes. There are all sorts of areas where there is a vital need to ensure the operational resilience of these kinds of technologies as well.', 'Michael Chui: This topic of the safety of AI is a very hot one right now, particularly as you’re starting to see it applied in places like self-driving cars. You’re seeing it in healthcare, where the potential impact on a person’s safety is very large.', 'In some cases we have a history of understanding how to try to ensure higher levels of safety in those fields. Now we need to apply them to these AI technologies because many of the engineers in these fields don’t understand that technology yet, although they’re growing in that area. That’s an important place to look in terms of the intersection of safety and AI.', 'Chris Wigley: And the way that some people have phrased that, which I like is, “What is the building code equivalent for AI?” I was renovating an apartment last year. The guy comes around from the local council and says, “Well, if you want to put a glass pane in here, because it’s next to a kitchen, it has to be 45-minutes fire resistant.” That’s evolved through 150, 200 years of various governments trying to do the right thing and ensure that people are building buildings which are safe for human beings to inhabit and minimize things like fire risk.', 'We’re still right at the beginning of that learning curve with AI. But it’s really important that we start to shape out some of those building code equivalents for bias, for fairness, for explainability, for some of the other topics that we’ll touch on.', 'Simon London: Chris, you just mentioned explainability. Just riff on that a little bit more. What’s the set of issues there?', 'Chris Wigley: Historically some of the most advanced machine learning and deep-learning models have been what we might call a black box. We know what the inputs into them are. We know that they usefully solve an output question like a classification question. Here’s an image of a banana or of a tree.', 'But we don’t know what is happening on the inside of those models. When you get into highly regulated environments like the pharmaceutical industry and also the banking industry and others, understanding how those models are making those decisions, which features are most important, becomes very important.', 'To take an example from the banking industry, in the UK the banks have recently been fined over 30 billion pounds, and that’s billion with a B for mis-selling of [payment] protection insurance. When we’re talking to some of the banking leaders here, they say, “Well, you know, as far as we understand it, AI is very good at responding to incentives.” We know that some of the historic problems were around sales teams that were given overly aggressive incentives. What if we incentivize the AI in the wrong way? How do we know what the AI is doing? How can we have that conversation with the regulator?', 'We’ve been doing a lot of work recently around, “How can we use AI to explain what AI is doing?” The way that that works in practice we’ve just done a test of this with a big bank in Europe in a safe area. This is how the relationship managers talk to their corporate clients. What are they talking to them about?', 'The first model is a deep-learning model, which we call a propensity model. What is the propensity of a customer to do something, to buy a product, to stop using the service? We then have a second machine-learning model, which is querying the first model millions of times to try and unearth why it’s made that decision. [See [Exhibit 2] for more on deep-learning models.]', '', 'It’s deriving what the features are that are most important. Is it because of the size of the company? Is it because of the products they already hold? Is it because of any of hundreds of other features? We then have a third machine-learning model, which is then translating the insights of the second model back into plain English for human beings to understand. If I’m the relationship manager in that situation, I don’t need to understand all of that complexity. But suddenly I get three or four bullet points written in plain English that say, “Not just here is the recommendation of what to do, but also here’s why.” It’s likely because of the size of that company, of the length of the relationship we’ve had with that customer, whatever it is, that actually A) explains what’s going on in the model and B) allows them to have a much richer conversation with their customer.', 'Just to close that loop, the relationship manager can then feed back into the model, “Yes, this was right. This was a useful conversation, or no, it wasn’t.” So we continue to learn. Using AI to explain AI starts to help us to deal with some of these issues around the lack of transparency that we’ve had historically.', 'Michael Chui: You could think about the ethical problem being, “What if we have a system that seems to work better than another one, but it’s so complex that we can’t explain why it works?” These deep-learning systems have millions of simulated neurons. Again trying to explain how that works is really, really difficult.', 'In some cases, as Chris was saying, the regulator requires you to explain what happened. Take, for example, the intersection with safety. If a self-driving car makes a left turn instead of hitting the brakes and it causes property damage or hurts somebody, a regulator might say, “Well, why did it do that?”', 'And it does call into question, “How do you provide a license?” In some cases what you want to do is examine the system and be able to understand and somehow guarantee that the technical system is working well. Others have said, “You should just give a self-driving car a driving test and then figure out.” Some of these questions are very real ones as we try to understand how to use and regulate these systems.', 'Chris Wigley: And there’s a very interesting trade-off often between performance and transparency. Maybe at some point in the future there won’t be a trade-off, but at the moment there is. So we might say for a bank that’s thinking about giving someone a consumer loan, we could have a black-box model, which gets us a certain level of accuracy, let’s say 96, 97 percent accuracy of prediction whether this person will repay. But we don’t know why. And so therefore we struggle to explain either to that person or to a regulator why we have or haven’t given that person a loan.', 'But there’s maybe a different type of model which is more explainable which gets us to 92, 93 percent level of accuracy. We’re prepared to trade off that performance in order to have the transparency.', 'If we put that in human terms, let’s say we’re going in for treatment. And there is a model that can accurately predict whether either a tumor is cancerous or another medical condition is right or wrong. To some extent, as a human being, if we’re reassured that this model is right and has been proven to be right in thousands of cases, we actually don’t care why it knows as long as it’s making a good prediction that a surgeon can act on that will improve our health.', 'We’re constantly trying to make these trade-offs between the situations where explainability is important and the situations where performance and accuracy are more important.', 'Michael Chui: Then for explainability it’s partly an ethical question. Sometimes it has to do with just achieving the benefits. We’ve looked at some companies where they’ve made the trade-off that Chris suggested, where they’ve gone to a slightly less performant system because they knew the explainability was important in order for people to accept the system and therefore actually start to use it.', 'Change management is one of the biggest problems in AI and other technologies to achieve benefits [Exhibit 3]. And so explainability can make a difference. But as Chris also said, “That can change over time.” For instance, I use a car with [anti-lock] braking systems. And the truth is I don’t know how that works. And maybe earlier on in that history people were worried: “You’re going to let the car brake for itself.”', 'But now we’ve achieved a level of comfort because we’ve discovered this stuff works almost all the time. If we start to see that comfort change in an individual basis as well.', '', 'Simon London: I’m going to ask an almost embarrassingly nerdy management question now. Stepping away from the technology, what’s our advice to clients about how to address some of these issues? Because some of this feels like it’s around risk management. As you think about deploying AI, how do you manage these ethical risk, compliant risks, you could phrase it any number of different ways. What’s the generalizable advice?', 'Michael Chui: Let me start with one piece of advice, which is as much as we expect executives to start to learn about every part of their business and maybe you’re going to be a general manager, you’re going to need to know something about supply chain, HR strategy, operations, sales and marketing. It is becoming incumbent on every executive to learn more about technology now.', 'To the extent to which they need to learn about AI, they’re going to need to learn more about what it means to deploy AI in an effective way. We can bring some of the historical practices—you mentioned risk management. Understanding risk is something that we’ve learned how to do in other fields.', 'We can bring some of those tools to bear here when we couple that with the technical knowledge as well. One thing we know about risk management: understand what all the risks are. I think bringing that framework to the idea of AI and its ethics carries over pretty well.', 'Simon London: Right. So it’s not just understanding the technology, but it’s also at a certain level understanding the ethics of the technology. At least get in your head what are the ethical or the regulatory or the risk implications of deploying the technology.', 'Michael Chui: That’s exactly right. Take, for example, bias. In many legal traditions around the world, understanding that there are a set of protected classes or a set of characteristics around which we don’t want to actually use technology or other systems in order to discriminate.', 'That understanding allows you to say, “Okay, we need to test our AI system to make sure it’s not creating disparate impact for these populations of people.” That’s a concept that we can take over. We might need to use other techniques in order to test our systems. But that’s something we can bring over from our management practices previously.', 'Chris Wigley: As a leader thinking about how to manage the risks in this area, dedicating a bit of head space to thinking about it is a really important first step. The second element of this is bring someone in who really understands it. In 2015, so three years ago now, we hired someone into QuantumBlack who is our chief trust officer.', 'No one at the time really knew what that title meant. But we knew that we had to have someone who was thinking about this full time as their job because trust is existential to us. What is the equivalent if you’re a leader leading an organization? What are the big questions for you in this area? How can you bring people into the organization or dedicate someone in the organization who has that kind of mind-set or capabilities to really think about this full time?', 'Michael Chui: To build on that, I think you need to have the right leaders in place. As a leadership team, you need to understand this. But the other important thing is to cascade this through the rest of the organization, understanding that change management is important as well.', 'Take the initiatives people had to do in order to comply with GDPR. That’s something that again I’m not saying that if you’re GDPR compliant, you’re ethical, but think about all the processes that you had to cascade not only for the leaders to understand but all of your people and your processes to make sure that they incorporate an understanding of GDPR.', 'I think the same thing is true in terms of AI and ethics as well. You think about everyone needs to understand a little bit about AI, and they have to understand, “How can we deploy this technology in a way that’s ethical, in a way that’s compliant with regulations?” That’s true for the entire organization. It might start at the top, but it needs to cascade through the rest of the organization.', 'Chris Wigley: We also have to factor in the risk of not innovating in this space, the risk of not embracing these technologies, which is huge. I think there’s this relationship between risk and innovation that is really important and a relationship between ethics and innovation. We need an ethical framework and an ethical set of practices that can enable innovation. If we get that relationship right, it should become a flywheel of positive impact where we have an ethical framework which enables us to innovate, which enables us to keep informing our ethical framework, which enables us to keep innovating. That positive momentum is the flip side of this. There’s a risk of not doing this as much as there are many risks in how we do it.', 'Simon London: Let’s talk a little bit more about this issue of algorithmic bias, whether it’s in the data set or actually in the system design. Again very practically, how do you guard against it?', 'Chris Wigley: We really see the answer to the bias question as being one of diversity. We can think about that in four areas. One is diversity of background of the people on a team. There’s this whole phenomenon around group think that people have blamed for all sorts of disasters. We see that as being very real. We have 61 different nationalities across QuantumBlack. We have as many or more academic backgrounds. Our youngest person is in their early 20s. Our oldest person in the company is in their late 60s. All of those elements of diversity of background come through very strongly.', 'We were at one point over 50 percent women in our technical roles. We’ve dropped a bit below that as we’ve scaled. But we’re keen to get back. Diversity of people is one big area.', 'The second is diversity of data. We touched on this topic of bias in the data sets not reflecting the populations that the model is looking at. We can start to understand and address those issues of data bias through diversity of data sets, triangulating one data set against another, augmenting one data set with another, continuing to add more and more different data perspectives onto the question that we’re addressing.', 'The third element of diversity is diversity of modeling. We very rarely just build a single model to address a question or to capture an opportunity. We’re almost always developing what we call ensemble models that might be a combination of different modeling techniques that complement each other and get us to an aggregate answer that is better than any of the individual models.', 'The final element of diversity we think about is diversity of mind-set. That can be diversity along dimensions like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or all of these other types of personality tests. But we also, as a leadership team, challenge ourselves in much simpler terms around diversity. We sometimes nominate who’s going to play the Eeyore role and who’s going to play the Tigger role when we’re discussing a decision. Framing it even in those simple Winnie the Pooh terms can help us to bring that diversity into the conversation. Diversity of background, diversity of data, diversity of modeling techniques, and diversity of mind-sets. We find all of those massively important to counter bias.', 'Michael Chui: So adding to the diversity points that Chris made, there are some process things that are important to do as well. One thing you can do as you start to validate the models that you’ve created is have them externally validated. Have someone else who has a different set of incentives check to make sure that in fact you’ve understood whether there’s bias there and understood whether there’s unintended bias there.', 'Some of the other things that you want to do is test the model either yourself or externally for specific types of bias. Depending on where you are, there might be classes of individuals or populations that you are not permitted to have disparate impact on. One of the important things to understand there is not only is race or sex or one of these protected characteristics—', 'Simon London: And a protected characteristic is a very specific legal category, right? And it will vary by jurisdiction?', 'Michael Chui: I’m not a lawyer. But, yes, depending on which jurisdiction you’re in, in some cases, the law states, “You may not discriminate or have disparate impact against certain people with a certain characteristic.” In order to ensure that you’re not discriminating or having disparate impact is not only that you don’t have gender as one of the fields in your database.', 'Because sometimes what happens is you have these, to get geeky, these co-correlates, these other things which are highly correlated with an indicator of a protected class. And so understanding that and being able to test for disparate impact is a core competency to make sure that you’re managing for biases.', 'Chris Wigley: One of the big issues, once the model is up and running, is, “How can we ensure that while we’ve tested it as it’s being developed, that it maintains in operation both accuracy and not being biased.” We’re in the reasonably early stages of this as an industry on ensuring resilience and ethical performance in production.', 'But some simple steps like, for example, having a process check to say, “When was the last time that this model was validated?” It sounds super simple. If you don’t do that, people have very busy lives, and they can just get overlooked. Building in those simple process steps all the way through to the more complicated technology-driven elements of this.', 'We can actually have a second model checking the first model to see if it’s suffering from model drift, for example. And then translate that into a very simple kind of red, amber, green dashboard of a model in performance. But a lot of this still relies on having switched-on human beings who maybe get alerted or helped by technology, but who engage their brain on the topic of, “Are these models, once they’re up and running, actually still performant?”', 'All sorts of things can trip them up. A data source gets combined upstream and suddenly the data feed that’s coming into the model is different from how it used to be. The underlying population in a given area may change as people move around. The technologies themselves change very rapidly. And so that question of how do we create resilient AI, which is stable and robust in production, is absolutely critical, particularly as we introduce AI into more and more critical safety and security and infrastructure systems.', 'Michael Chui: And the need to update models is a more general problem than just making sure that you don’t have bias. It’s made even more interesting when there are adversarial cases. When in fact just to say, for instance, you have a system that’s designed to detect fraud. People who are fraudulent obviously, don’t want to get detected. So they might change their behavior understanding that the model is starting to detect certain things.', 'And so again, you really need to understand when you need to update the model whether it’s to make sure that you’re not introducing bias or just in general to make sure that it’s performing.', 'Chris Wigley: There’s an interesting situation in the UK where the UK government has set up a new independent body called the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation that is really working on balancing these things out. How can you maximize the benefits of AI to society within an ethical framework?', 'And the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, or CDEI, is not itself a regulatory body but is advising the various regulatory bodies in the UK like the FCA, which regulates the financial industry and so on. I suspect we’ll start to see more and more thinking at a government and inter-government level on these topics. It’ll be a very interesting area over the next couple of years.', 'Simon London: So AI policy broadly speaking is coming into focus and coming to the fore and becoming much more important over time.', 'Michael Chui: It is indeed becoming more important. But I also think that it’s interesting within individual regulatory jurisdictions, whether it’s in healthcare or in aviation, whether it’s what happens on roads, the degree to which our existing practices can be brought to bear.', 'So again as I said, are driving tests the way that we’ll be able to tell whether autonomous vehicles should be allowed on the roads? There are things around medical licensure and how is that implicated in terms of the AI systems that we might want to bring to bear. Understanding that tradition and seeing what can be applied to AI already is really important.', 'Simon London: So what is the standard to which we hold AI? And how does that compare to the standard to which we hold humans?', 'Michael Chui: Indeed.', 'Chris Wigley: Absolutely. In the context of something like autonomous vehicles, that’s a really interesting question. Because we know that a human population of a certain size that drives a certain amount is likely to have a certain number of accidents a year. Is the right level for allowing autonomous vehicles when it’s better than that level or when it’s better than that level by a factor of ten?', 'Or do we only allow it when we get to a perfect level? And is that ever possible? I don’t think that anyone knows the answer to that question at the moment. But I think that as we start to flesh out these kinds of ethics frameworks around machine learning and AI and so on, we need to deploy them to answer questions like that in a way which various stakeholders in society really buy into.', 'A lot of the answers to fleshing out these ethical questions have to come from engaging with stakeholder groups and engaging with society more broadly, which is in and of itself an entire process and entire skill set that we need more of as we do more AI policy making.', 'Simon London: Well, thank you, Chris. And thank you, Michael, for a fascinating discussion.', 'Michael Chui: Thank you.', 'Chris Wigley: It’s been great.', 'Michael Chui is a partner of the McKinsey Global Institute and is based in McKinsey’s San Francisco office.

The year passed without a major international incident, certainly nothing on the scale of the WannaCry ransomware attack, in 2017. And yet every few weeks brought news of another big data breach at another big company. So where do we stand going into 2019? Are we winning, in any sense? When and where will the next so-called tier-one attack occur? And, importantly, what is the role of government in helping to ensure national cybersecurity. To find out more, I sat down in London with David Chinn, a McKinsey senior partner who works with public- and private-sector organizations on these issues, and also with Robert Hannigan, who is the former head of GCHQ, the UK government’s electronic-surveillance agency. Robert also led the creation of the UK National Cyber Security Centre, or NCSC. Today he’s a McKinsey senior adviser. Robert and David, welcome to the podcast.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Thank you, Simon. Glad to be here.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Thanks.', 'Simon London:\\u2002I think for a layperson, the general question around cybersecurity is, probably, are we winning?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002No, I think we are making progress, but I think it would be very rash to say we’re winning. If you look at the two big trends, the rise in volume of attacks and the rise in sophistication, they are both alarming. On volume, particularly of crime, there were something like 317 million new pieces of malicious code, or malware, [in 2016]. That’s nearly a million a day, so that’s pretty alarming.', 'On the sophistication, we’ve seen, particularly, states behaving in an aggressive way and using very sophisticated state capabilities and that bleeding into sophisticated criminal groups. It’s a rise in the sheer tradecraft of attacks. So no, I don’t think we’re winning, but I think we’re doing the right things to win in the future.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002I would agree with Robert. We may not have seen a single attack that brought down multiple institutions in the same way that WannaCry did, but look at the list of institutions reporting very sizable breaches of increasingly sensitive data.', 'Now we’ve got some more regulation forcing people to be more transparent about the breaches and the length of time that attackers were inside networks before being discovered. And it’s not always clear to those attacked what they’ve lost. I’m broadly pessimistic.', 'Simon London:\\u2002When you think about where the next tier-one attack might come, what are some of the vulnerabilities that in business and government people are thinking about, talking about?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002I think most of the focus now is on supply-chain and upstream risk, because even the best-defended companies now realize that their vulnerability is either those who are connected to their vendors, their suppliers, even their customers. And, increasingly, government is worrying about the IT infrastructure, so the global supply chain, both hardware and software, and its integrity.', 'And some of the state attacks we’ve seen in the last couple of years have been against the backbone of the internet, if you like. Routers, switches, places that give you massive options to do different things with internet traffic [Exhibit 1]. It’s going deeper and more sophisticated.', '', 'David Chinn:\\u2002I think there’s different versions of what tier one might feel like. I think that the increasing ability of both criminals and states to attack critical infrastructure [is one of them]. Taking out power to a city might have relatively limited impact in terms of the actual damage done, but could have a huge impact on the way people feel.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002There’s a difference between a genuinely catastrophic damaging attack and a politically sensitive attack that spreads fear and terror or a lack of trust in data. It’s fairly easy to imagine things that will lead to public panic.', 'You’ve seen big public controversies over airlines and banks being unable to function, often not through cyberattacks. But if you were to multiply that and see it as a malicious attack, you could see genuine public disquiet, a lot of political pressure to do something about it.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Yes, it’s interesting, because when you talk about critical infrastructure of the modern economy, you often think about things, like, as you say, the internet backbone. It’s those kind of things. Or maybe financial services, the financial system. But just talk a little bit more about the supply chain, for example. That’s one that I think in the broad conversation and the broad business public is less discussed.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002If you think about, at the simplest level, how a pint of milk gets onto the supermarket shelf, there are many stages in that, from the farm—by the way, the cows are milked by a machine, which is probably connected to a network—through to the transport network. The cold chain. The monitoring of the cold chain.', 'You don’t need to disrupt anything except the record that says the milk was kept cold for it no longer to be a product that can be given to the public. The integrity of that data is the essential glue that sticks it all together.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002If you think of the big ransomware attacks of WannaCry and NotPetya a couple of years ago, one of the lessons from those is that although they almost certainly weren’t targeting big manufacturing enterprises in Europe, they effectively disabled quite a lot of household-name companies. They simply couldn’t do business, couldn’t manufacture for, in one case, several weeks. It was a wake-up call to sectors of the economy who thought they weren’t a target for cyberattacks because they didn’t have great IP or data that was worth stealing.', 'The Internet of Things is simply connecting more processes and more devices to the internet. And it is quite striking that the level of security built into those is usually very low because they’re designed and built and procured on cost [Exhibit 2]. There will probably be a role for regulation to improve the standards there.', '', 'But it does mean companies are, both through digitization and through the Internet of Things, increasing their attack surface, making it harder for them to understand the perimeters of their own networks, harder to see where their vulnerabilities are. That is a real problem for the next five, ten years.', 'Simon London:\\u2002And is this one of the reasons that people are very interested, for example, in blockchain? The application of blockchain in the supply chain.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Yes, I think blockchain holds a massive potential because of the holy grail, really, of having a ledger that is distributed and unchangeable and visible to everybody. That has great benefits in cybersecurity. It’s got a bad name because it’s used for Bitcoin, and Bitcoin has a bad name, but I think blockchain technology is fantastic.', 'It’s not straightforward to apply, and I think there’s a lot of talk about it. The application in particular sectors for particular uses is still to be developed, to be honest. But it certainly ought to be a net gain for security, and particularly for data integrity, because one of the big future worries is it’s one thing to destroy data or steal it or ransom it. To change it and undermine trust in data, particularly in financial services, could be catastrophic.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Or, indeed, milk, which is what gave me the thought. It’s a very, very simple example, but it underlines how much of the economy runs on trust in that data.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002We’re just seeing criminals moving in this direction and looking at ways of looking at the corruption of data to, for example, affect stock prices. There’s a huge potential there to use the changes to data, or to put out false data, to affect the value of a company.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Fake news is a great example. They haven’t affected the integrity of the core data. They’re just simply putting out noise. In the reports on the attacks of the integrity of the electoral system in the United States, in a system which is highly distributed, where different standards and technologies are used across the United States, there was clear evidence of attempts to penetrate electoral registers. You imagine changing the electoral register so that people of a certain party simply didn’t appear. In the hustle and bustle of Election Day, they probably wouldn’t get to place their votes. That could dramatically undermine trust in democracy.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Robert, we’re lucky to have you on the podcast today. Why don’t you talk a little bit about what is the role of government in all of this?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002It’s a challenge that every government is grappling with in different ways and has been over the last ten years. There are a couple of things that make cyber particularly difficult. One is cyberdefense undercuts the assumption that government can do defense for everybody.', 'David has spent a lot of his time dealing with government defense in a traditional sense. And you, as a citizen, expect government to defend you using the armed forces. It’s unrealistic to expect government to do cyberdefense in the same way for the whole economy, because of the scale of it, and because most of what you’re dealing with is outside government. Quite apart from the fact that the skills and resources just aren’t there in government to do it on that scale. So that’s one problem.', 'The other problem is that cyber is crosscutting in every sense. It is in a new domain, so it’s a bit like discovering water or air. Every department, every part of the economy, is dependent on this, increasingly, as we digitize more and become more dependent. You can’t really point to a single bit of government and say, “You’re responsible for cyber.” That was the tendency in the early days.', 'The answer has to be to find a way of organizing government that gives sufficient speed and command and control to deal with the pace at which digital networks work and cyberattacks work but that actually drags out the whole of government to be good at cybersecurity, because if any one bit is bad at it, the whole system suffers.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Robert, it’s interesting what you say because in a sense, government has three challenges. One, it is an actor in cyberspace in service of national interest, usually in secret. Second, it has to protect itself from cyberattack. And third, it has to create, at the minimum, an environment which protects the citizens and businesses of the country.', 'My observation would be that, at least reportedly, the UK is very good in the first. Your old institution is a world-class actor in the national interest in cyberspace. The second is quite hard, defending government, because there’s so much of it.', 'The technical skills of government, government IT, are continually in the newspapers and in the public accounts committee as being something that we struggle to do well. Simple things, like putting a working computer on everybody’s desk, let alone defending those networks.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Most governments, including the UK, have focused their attention on protecting government networks, sometimes interpreted slightly more broadly to take in some critical bits of national infrastructure that really, really matter, but to encourage the rest of the economy to get better. So we spent ten, 15 years, in a sense, preaching at companies to get them to raise their standards.', 'There was quite a critical shift, certainly in the UK, about three or four years ago, where we decided that a security model that depended on everybody and every company doing the right thing all the time was almost bound to fail. The whole system was not designed with security in mind, so the people who invented the internet and then the web that sits on it didn’t have security at the front of mind, and so we are retrofitting that, and have been over the last 15 years.', 'Things like scanning websites for vulnerabilities, which is, again, being done across government, you could do nationally, and you could make that available nationally. One of the problems, I think, is that because the internet wasn’t designed with security in mind, security is seen as something you need to add on rather than something that’s built in.', 'We need to reach a point where security is designed in and is there by default, particularly with the Internet of Things. That may require some regulation and certainly will require bits of the economy, including insurance, to start to drag up standards.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Do you think government’s been remiss on regulation? My observation would be that GDPR [Exhibit 3], which is not a cyberregulation, but that puts significant penalties on institutions for allowing private information to be misused, which includes being stolen, is having quite a big impact already in terms of reporting and transparency, which is then going to inevitably lead to more investment and more focus by organizations on protecting that data. Do you think government missed the boat a little bit on regulation?', '', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002I think government, certainly in this country, has been reluctant to regulate, for all sorts of reasons. In cyber, there’s a particular reason why regulation can be difficult, because it can end up being very prescriptive and very tick box, and it doesn’t take account of the speed at which technology is changing and the particular networks that a company may have. We preferred an advisory, “Here are objectives you should meet”—a risk-based approach, I suppose.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Best practices and these kind of things.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Yes. Then there is a good case for saying we need a tougher approach on regulation. I think the EU is moving in that direction. I think GDPR has been a net benefit, because essentially there are two sides to most cyberattacks. There’s “Did you do the right things to prevent it, and then how did you handle it afterward?”', 'So GDPR has been particularly strong on the second bit. First of all, it’s removed the debate in companies about whether they reveal the attack and how long, because they have to. That’s good. It’s raised awareness in boardrooms and so, to some degree, panic in boardrooms.', 'But I think the best regulation probably is in the states. It’s interesting to see that California is introducing some hardware-IT supply-chain regulation, which will have a big impact, I think, given that so much of it is designed there, even if it’s mostly made in China. There is a place for regulation, and we probably should have done more of it. The difficulty is lack of skills, again. I think most governments don’t have sufficient skills.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Ah, well, that was going to be my next question. Yes. To your point, David, I mean government IT doesn’t have a massively positive reputation in the world at large. Sometimes unfairly. But yes, do governments have the technical skills in cyber to protect their own networks?', 'David Chinn:\\u2002The interesting thing about cyber is that the source of innovation in attacks is mostly coming from inside governments. Many governments have very highly skilled people who when their knowledge leaks into the public domain gets adopted quickly by criminals. We have the equivalent of government weapons proliferation into cyberspace.', 'If you follow the cyberindustry, where there’s a huge number of start-ups, effectively, each year’s retiring crop of government hackers is bringing new innovation from inside the secret domains of government in an appropriately, hopefully appropriately, modified way to the benefit of those who are under attack, often from other governments. One can’t say that there are no skills in government. The best skills are probably in government.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002That’s true, but I wouldn’t underestimate the creativity and innovation of criminal groups. They are genuinely creative. They are talking to each other about, “How could we do this in a better way? How could we defraud this particular bank? What technique is going to work best? What’s the best way of delivering it?”', 'They are doing what so many traditional companies are trying to do, which is pull in skills from around the internet. Not necessarily colocated. They’ve clocked something about how to harness young innovative skills and do creative things. We have quite a bit to learn from them, I think. I agree that governments have been very good in quite a small and narrow way, but the criminal world is also pretty innovative.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002I think this is similar, certainly in the UK, to the crisis in STEM education. If people don’t study STEM subjects, we’re just not going to have the inflow into the economy, whether it be for government or private industry.', 'I’ve been particularly impressed by the way that Israel has effectively said that this is a national defensive-capability issue, but it’s a national industrial-growth issue. The country decided they wanted to have one of the world’s leading cyberindustry platforms and that to do that they had to make a massive investment in skills.', 'They started with after-school activities in the most deprived areas, because they recognized that if you start young enough in a country where almost every home has a computer, even those with very low means, who think that having a computer is important, that you can build those skills, in a sense, in parallel to formal education.', 'Many people who are extremely talented in the cyberdomain actually don’t do particularly well at school. It’s an outlet for those people, and I think it’s been very, very successful. It’s created a great pipeline of talent into government and private industry.', 'Simon London:\\u2002I think about another interesting question for government is how you manage this tension between the need for transparency and bringing the whole economy with you, and yet at the same time there is an element of secrecy, acting in the national interest and so on. How do you manage that tension in practice?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002I think the key insight of the last ten years has been that you can’t do cybersecurity in secret. You can’t do it behind a wall in the intelligence agencies. For the obvious reason that the attacks are out there in open source in the economy, on the internet. It’s all visible. Well, most of it visible.', 'It makes no sense to try to do it in the way that you’ve tackled traditional security threats, which may be very, very secret and coming from very sophisticated governments. There is a side of that that is true for cyber, but most of it is not. Most of what people experience in cyber, whether companies or individuals, is crime. Some of it’s state-backed crime, but still crime. And it simply doesn’t work to be referring constantly to a secret world that can’t really communicate.', 'The obvious development here has been to create a national cybersecurity center that was outside the secret world, but under the aegis and under the control of GCHQ, which is where the skills sat. And to have a blend of both. In the headquarters you’ve got access to secret systems for some people, but the key point is that you have openness to industry, and you have industry people sitting alongside government experts.', 'It goes back to our discussion of regulation. What you need in cyber, you can’t simply have cyberregulators who do it for everybody, because so much is domain-specific. You need to understand the energy sector to regulate or advise on how to do cybersecurity of energy, or for any other sector. It’s different. Therefore, the idea is to have experts from those particular sectors sitting literally alongside a deep cyberexpert.', 'Simon London:\\u2002To your point, David, it sounds like a lot of companies are struggling with this same cultural pull between the secrecy but the need to share information really to be effective, or to be more effective and to collaborate with your peers and share information.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Yes, and I think we’ll see the information commissioner shaping the environment around transparency quite actively in the very near future.', 'Simon London:\\u2002This is your point around regulation?', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Yes. I think that will really change people’s understanding of how much they can legitimately keep secret.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Can we just internationalize the conversation a little bit? If you look across the international context, what are other governments who are doing this well and innovatively, and who we can all learn from?', '', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002I would say Singapore and Israel are doing it very well, in slightly different models. Australia has chosen a model that’s similar to the UK model [Exhibit 4]. Having it all in one place effectively. Certainly, the operational side of cyber.', 'Most governments are organizing and constantly tweaking the system. There are very different models, and in Europe, perhaps in Germany especially, the cyber agencies are purely civilian. And then there is a secret-world element of cyber, and I think they’re also looking at how to bring those two together in a way that works for them, given the different constitutional setup.', 'The military in many countries has a primacy in cyber, and certainly in Germany they’ve been given a strong lead in cyberdefense. That brings both opportunities, because the military always have a lot of resources and they’re very good at organizing stuff. But also challenges, because they’re not used to dealing with defending banks and the economy, and it’s a culture shock for them. They don’t necessarily feel that’s part of their remit. There are difficulties in the military.', 'The US, everybody looks to, but I think it’s so large, with its multiplicity of agencies, that it’s struggling. It has fantastic capabilities, obviously. The private sector is probably better organized, particularly in financial services, than anywhere in the world. But you often get the criticism or complaint from the private sector that the links to government are not quite right yet.', 'That I think reflects partly the fact that it’s still evolving; the Department of Homeland Security, that was given this leadership under the Bush administration, is still developing. It’s not straightforward, particularly on that scale. I don’t think anybody has a perfect answer.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002I think the military is a very interesting subset of government because I don’t think there was even one model in the military. Some countries are creating cybercommands. Others are building cyber in all of their commands. Others are concentrating in their intelligence services, and then combining those in different ways. And that’s also changing over time.', 'Simon London:\\u2002It sounds like we’re in an era of institutional innovation, in many ways—to some degree, institutional improvisation to try and figure out what models work in what context.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Absolutely. I think the military’s a very good example, particularly outside the US. The US is ahead of anybody, I think, in developing cyberskills in the military at scale. On the broader point about civilian structures and civilian/military, I think the one thing that is probably key is that many of the questions are the same, starting with, “What does government actually want to achieve?” And not being overambitious in what government can achieve, and what’s the appropriate role of government, is a good starting point. And trying to define what people expect from their government. Things like a single source of advice, incident response, protection of certain networks. I think that is a conversation that just about every government is having in different ways.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002But I think there’s a paradox here, because if you were to interview the chairman or chief executive of any large corporation and ask them what’s their top three risks, cyber would be on that top three, for every single one. And for many of them, it would be number one. Yet, if we look at what governments are doing, this is the one area of national security, of crime prevention and prosecution of critical national infrastructure, that governments have, to a large extent, abdicated their responsibility. Great, some small steps. And sorry, I don’t mean to be critical of what was a big small step. But exalting the private sector to do better feels like a very different role that government takes in almost every aspect of life that would feature for most people in their top three risks. I think there’s a lot more to do, but unfortunately we may have to wait for a genuine event—people talk of the cyber 9/11—to create a big change in focus, understanding, spending, and so on.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Let me just put that back to you. What should be done?', 'David Chinn:\\u2002What would your list be, Robert?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Your criticism is very fair. I mean I think the government has moved from an absolutely sort of hands-off position to say, “Well, we’ll look after our networks, but everybody else should get better.” And sort of slightly hectoring them when they’re not good enough. To saying, “Yes, there are things that we could do at national scale.”', 'The problem, I suppose, at the risk of sort of making excuses, is that the nature of cyberspace, however defined, makes politicians feel quite impotent, because it cuts across jurisdictions. They can pass laws in their own parliament that really have zero effect. They can regulate their own companies, but not necessarily others. That is a real problem.', 'For cybercrime, for example, most of it is based in countries which are either endemically corrupt or unwilling to do anything about it for geopolitical reasons. What do you do about that? I mean there’s a much bigger context here of international relations, and we are a million miles from getting any kind of international agreements on the security and safety of cyberspace.', 'Simon London:\\u2002David, you were the rousing voice of critique just now. What should be done?', 'David Chinn:\\u2002First, a sophisticated debate around the legislative and regulatory environment. The use of product liability has been very effective in other sectors for changing the game for the manufacturers. A robust thinking about product liabilities, extension to the technology arena, would frankly have quite a chastening effect on industry.', 'Simon London:\\u2002In other words, selling a product that has technology embedded that is deemed to be insecure could be breaking the law.', 'David Chinn:\\u2002Well, not necessarily breaking the law, but would expose you to civil action that could have severe financial consequences. Effectively, it would create a market mechanism for valuing more secure products. Second, there is room for some better and some more regulation. For example, if you want to sell anything to the UK government, you have to meet a minimum standard called Cyber Essentials. This is not the most sophisticated, but, as we’ve discussed, most of the attacks are not the most sophisticated attacks.', 'These kind of standards are very helpful because they’re easily adopted by people for their own supply chains. I think a promulgation of standards, ideally with some degree of harmonization. And it’s very interesting, in the US the national standards organization, NIST, 2    \\r             2.\\r          \\r             National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\r               \\r \\r  has created a number of models, which have got global acceptance. Once an authority puts it out there in a world where there’s a lot of uncertainty, there’s a lot of demand for good standards.', 'The traditional tools of government around legislation, regulation, standards setting, and so on could be used quite a lot more, without throttling innovation. Industry always says, “You’re going to throttle innovation.” What they mean is it’s going to cost them more. But the cost to society of insecurity is high and is going to get higher.', 'Simon London:\\u2002One of my takeaways from this conversation, tell me if this is right or wrong, is that there will be one or more significant tier-one, we might call them attacks, on critical national infrastructure. We’re recording this in London, but it may not be based in the UK. But that will come. We know where it will come. And that will probably shift the debate into a higher gear. That probably will shift the international debate about what is to be done and, in some ways, get this taken more seriously, perhaps at government policy and regulatory level. Is that a correct takeaway?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002I think for most people, most of what they would experience, and most companies, is still crime. So that’s the volume, but everybody understandably gets excited about the catastrophic attack and that there is a range of possibilities for and the insurance industry worries a lot about systemic failure. So systemic failure of cloud providers, for example. Systemic failure of some major financial institutions, two or three of which would bring down the system or could bring down the system. So those are the kind of real tier one. But there may be some political tier-one problems and attacks that will have the kind of effect that David was talking about earlier, of panic and political pressure.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Trust.', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Yes, either trust or an attack that leads to loss of life. It might not be massive loss of life, but it would put huge pressure, as terrorism does, on politicians to react.', 'Simon London:\\u2002So what’s that Churchill phrase, this is not the beginning of the end. This is the end of the beginning?', 'Robert Hannigan:\\u2002Well, I don’t think it’s even really the end of the beginning. I think we’re still at very early stages of this technology. For most people, it’s 15, 20 years old. Even if you look back to the ARPANET, 3    \\r             3.\\r          \\r             Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.\\r               \\r \\r  it’s, what, 40, 50 years old? That’s not long, and it’s developing incredibly fast.', 'We are about to add a massive amount of new processing power, and therefore new data to the system, mostly through the Internet of Things. We have a whole new issue emerging with quantum computing, and people have not quite woken up, including the regulators, to the fact that current encryption will cease to be useful once quantum arrives.', 'We need now to be building in quantum-safe encryption standards, which are available through NIST and through others. But if we don’t do that, everything, every company’s records, every bit of financial data, every transaction is going to be readable from the moment that quantum computing really arrives at scale. It’s a wonderful innovation, and it has obviously lots of possibilities on the other side of the equation, but it is one that we need to start thinking about in regulatory terms now.', 'Simon London:\\u2002All right.

75,Tapping into the business value of design,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/tapping-into-the-business-value-of-design,"Design, whether it’s of products or experiences, is not only about aesthetics but also about specific actions taken to boost revenues and customer engagement.","['Design, whether it’s of products or experiences, is not only about aesthetics but also about specific actions taken to boost revenues and customer engagement.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey partners Ben Sheppard and Hyo Yeon about new research that demonstrates the dramatic impact that specific design actions have on the revenue growth of companies that are considered top performers in design.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be talking about one of the fuzziest words in the business dictionary: “design.” Perhaps it’s clear to designers, but for the benefit of the rest of us, what actually is design? As an executive, when and how much should you invest in it? And if you do, how should you organize, measure, and manage your design capability? To discuss the issues, I caught up with Benedict Sheppard, a London-based McKinsey partner who has led some recent research into the business value of design. We were joined by Hyo Yeon, a New York–based McKinsey partner and also a practicing designer.', 'Hyo and Ben, thanks so much. Welcome to the podcast. Thanks for doing this.', 'Hyo Yeon: Thank you.', 'Ben Sheppard: Delighted to be here. Thank you.', 'Simon London: I’m going to start with a very simple question. When we’re talking about design, Hyo, what are we talking about?', 'Hyo Yeon:  There are three core elements to design. One, obviously, is the craft, the doing of design, which is closer to artisanal, beautiful, creating artifacts, creating experiences. The next is the end product, a product or a service, or, in my world, a digital experience. All of those things are actually design. The third, which is design thinking, many people are familiar with, is the method by which we tackle problems or challenges. And it’s not just design problems. It’s any kind of problem that we can crack with a design-thinking methodology. So those three things come together.', 'Simon London: So it’s like a craft, a process, and then an end product, but it doesn’t have to be a physical product. It could be a service or something like that. Would you agree with that, Ben? Is that a good summation?', 'Ben Sheppard: Absolutely. Those three come together in that they’re all trying to do one thing. They’re all trying to get under the skin of understanding users and then create or design something to meet their needs. I do think design is one of those terms which means many things to many people. It’s one of those terms that’s abused and misused like agile and big data. One of the things that we are very keen to make sure is that design isn’t boxed in as being seen just about physical products or just about a material finished aesthetic.', 'Simon London: It’s often asserted, I think, implicitly by us as well, that design is more important today. Is that true? And if so, why is it true?', 'Ben Sheppard: We would argue that design has always been important. If your company isn’t making great products or services, then frankly, what is it doing? What I do think has changed over the last few years is that it’s getting harder to do great design and stand out from the crowd.', 'There are a couple of reasons for that, some of them internal, some of them external. Externally, you’ve got rising consumer expectations set by the likes of companies such as Amazon that leak into every field of life, whether it be consumer or business. You’ve got a world where marketplaces are evermore global and therefore companies are being compared to more competitors than ever before, making it hard to stand out.', 'Then, of course, you’ve got the internal piece, which is design used to be seen as a very discrete field. As design has evolved, it’s become more cross-functional. Physical, digital, service design have all converged. And that’s great for the end user. But from an organizational point of view, that’s very challenging, indeed, to manage. And because all these different forces have come together at once, it means that that act of making stand-out products and services that really delight customers is harder than ever before for many companies out there.', 'Hyo Yeon: I think all of this points to something that is important to talk about, which is design is not one product or one touchpoint or one channel, even. It’s the whole end-to-end journey of a user or a customer. All of that needs to be looked at in one holistic way in order to solve for any point in that journey, including all of the players in the ecosystem and looking at the beginning, middle, and end of how they experience a particular service or brand or product is the way to solve for and create really awesome design.', 'Simon London: Let’s get to the meat of the research. Ben, if you don’t mind, describe what we did.', 'Ben Sheppard: What we did is look at the performance of 300 publicly listed companies over a five-year period. In that five-year period, we were interested in two things about those companies. First, their financial performance: How did they do in terms of revenue, in terms of profit, in terms of shareholder return?', 'The second thing we were interested in is, “What are the design actions that those companies took over that same period?” The design action could be putting someone in the executive board who has a responsibility for design or it could be changing people’s bonus structure to tie to design metrics, not just financial metrics. What we ended up with was a database which we believe to be truly unique. It contains two million financial data points, 110,000 design actions. And, of course, the question we then had is, “Well, is there any correlation between those two?”', 'Simon London: Now, how much of the information about design actions came from publicly available data like earning statements, these kind of things? Or how much of it came from getting real access to the guts of what the companies have done?', 'Ben Sheppard: This is really going behind the curtain with these organizations. Therefore, one of the things that we’re not able to do is release the names of those companies because they’ve given us this privileged access, which has allowed this data to happen for the first time.', 'There have been other reports, which have been done with outside information before. However, I don’t think, speaking with our own clients, they’ve been granular enough or rigorous enough to actually lead to different behavior by senior management. What we’re hoping we’ve done for the first time is create a quantitative analytical look at what truly drives business performance from a design perspective.', 'Simon London: And just give us the top-line results?', 'Ben Sheppard: If you only remember one thing, it’s that good design is good business. The numbers are dramatic here. The revenue growth of top design performers was almost double that of their industry peers. The shareholder return growth of top design performers was 70 percent higher than their industry peers (Exhibit 1).', '', 'These are dramatic numbers. McKinsey does a lot of social-science work, looking for correlation between organizational actions and financial performance. This is some of the most dramatic that we’ve seen in the last decade. So that’s the top-line message.', 'The second thing that came out of the research was that good design is good business, across a very broad set of industries. We looked at three. We looked at consumer packaged goods. We looked at medical devices. And we looked at retail banking. We chose those quite purposefully because we were interested to understand, “Is product design different from service design? Is that different from digital design? Is only one of these tied to improved business performance?” (Exhibit 2).', '', 'The results categorically say, “No, this is about design overall. It’s about understanding your customers. It’s about creating a great solution for them. And it doesn’t matter whether that’s physical, digital, or service.” The third and final insight was that this is a game of disproportionate rewards. An extra dollar spent on design doesn’t necessarily mean an extra dollar of output. This was really a case where, if you do design fantastically well, you stand out from the competition, then you are disproportionately rewarded in terms of revenue and certainly disproportionately rewarded in terms of the market.', 'And that makes sense from a user perspective. Frankly, no one cares if your product is the 32nd best or the 31st best. The user’s going to be looking at the top two or three and comparing them. If you’re not in that space, then you’re out of the game.', 'Simon London: Now the question is for top-performing companies that are really good at design, what do they do differently?', 'Ben Sheppard: We looked at hundreds of design actions that these companies were taking. Time after time, four themes kept on rising to the surface as the design actions with the best correlation with improved performance (Exhibit 3). The first one was around design being more than a feeling. It was about analytical leadership, making sure that you treated design with the same level of rigor that you might treat revenue or cost when discussing it in the boardroom.', '', 'The second theme was around design being more than a phase. It’s about continuous iteration, making sure that from strategy to launch you continue to optimize your design by testing it with users time after time after time. Those companies that have a single discrete design phase and then never change the design after that point are much more likely to have a product that flops at launch as opposed to those companies that continue to iterate from strategy to launch to keep on improving, refining, optimizing.', 'And sometimes people think that means more cost. It doesn’t necessarily. In fact, it can mean the opposite. If you prototype cheaply enough and early enough, you can avoid a big, costly mistake later down the line.', 'The third piece was around design being more than a department. Those companies that siloed the designers and didn’t see them as part of the organization, didn’t perform anywhere near as well financially as those who embedded them in cross-functional teams and made design everyone’s responsibility. If you create an artificial silo of designers and don’t allow them to integrate with the rest of the business, that usually leads to a decrease in business performance.', 'The final theme was around design being more than a product. No user wakes up and says, “It’s brilliant that the designers on hardware and software in that company had clearly never spoken to each other.” We are living in a world where experience matters, and you need to create a seamless experience between physical, digital, and service design. Take the automotive industry. They don’t want just a physical car anymore. They want that to connect with their smartphone. They want that to connect with their lives in a way that they wouldn’t have expected five years ago. That means a new form of convergent design. And the companies who have understood that are reaping the financial rewards.', 'Simon London: I’m just going to be a methodological devil’s advocate because somebody will be listening to this at home or in the car and is going to say, “Well, that’s all very well, Ben. But presumably you do just have correlation here. You don’t have causation.”', 'Ben Sheppard: Back to the comment around social science, yes, many things affect something like shareholder value. You could never claim that as only driven by design. It would be wrong of us to in any way suggest it. However, the 300 companies, 110,000 design actions, two million financial data points, to take that information and still through all the noise of other things happening in the world, see such strong correlation, that really suggests something quite powerful here. And it’s certainly enough to make us stand up and say, “We think this is something quite remarkable.”', 'Simon London: So it’s the strength of the correlation as much as anything. If it was a really weak signal, it might be more of a valid objection. But on this one, there’s something going on here.', 'Ben Sheppard: The strength, and it’s happening multiple times. So, absolutely, if you look at the overall performance from a design perspective, that correlates. But if you look at the individual themes of best performance, all of those correlate as well. That would be extraordinary coincidence.', 'Simon London: Hyo, let’s bring you in here. Of those four themes that Ben just went through, are any of those surprising to you?', 'Hyo Yeon: As a designer, it’s clear that a beautifully designed, well-thought-out product involves people from all disciplines of an organization. As a designer, you also know that you need to have real data and real information to inform you about how a user behaves or what the shortcomings or the opportunity areas are.', 'And as designers, we’ve been trained to iterate very quickly, so to involve the user throughout a design process, prototype, get stuff out there, and respond to how users work with those prototypes to refine over time. All of those principles have been our bread and butter for many, many years. I think, for as long as I can remember, I have wished that we could have an ROI [return-on-investment] conversation after a design presentation. And I think that finally we might be able to do that.', 'Ben Sheppard: That was one of the most stark findings in the research, was to say, “If you look at these actions, while they may be commonsense, they’re not common practice, because they need senior management to orchestrate. They can’t be done by designers alone. And therefore, if you want to really make a shift change, you need all of your senior management onboard to make this possible.”', 'Simon London: So just to double click on one of the themes that you mentioned, which is more than a department. This idea that you cannot silo design, that it has to be integrated. As somebody who works with designers, slightly tongue in cheek, I must say that field’s challenging, because designers are different, right? Wouldn’t you agree, Hyo? I mean, designers do need slightly different treatment and have slightly different expectations about how they’re going to work in an organization.', 'Hyo Yeon: Yes. To a degree, they are different. We need space to be inspired, to think about things in a slightly different way, to learn from other designs that we come across. But I think that’s evolving. There are these—I don’t know if I should I call it “new”—but a new generation of designers that is much more T-shaped, not just experts in the field of design but also very savvy about technology, very savvy about business impact, very interested in working across the organization with many different functional areas to make sure that the end product that comes out of a design process makes absolute business sense, is absolutely usable, and is absolutely feasible.', 'Ben Sheppard: Once you’ve got those rare T-shaped hybrid designers inside your organization, you can then do a lot to help them integrate with the rest of the organization. You put them with people from engineering, from marketing, from finance, from project management. Aligned incentives goes an awful long way to make sure everyone’s singing from the same hymn sheet, making sure that everyone feels a responsibility for understanding the user, everyone feels a responsibility for the overall success of the product or service, can break down a lot of the internal barriers between different departments.', 'One example that came out of the research was for a global furniture manufacturer. They decided to close a design center, which they felt had siloed many of their best creative thinkers. They integrated those people into cross-functional teams. Fast-forward three years, not only were they getting products to market 10 percent faster because they’d reduced the internal friction, but they were generating 30 percent more revenue. That was because everyone felt that design was their responsibility, not just a small group of designers.', 'Simon London: Another interesting theme is this idea that bringing data to bear on design is an important set of practices. I did wonder, Hyo, as a practicing designer, does that feel a little bit like design by numbers? What’s the role of the craft that you mentioned earlier, the creative spark?', 'Hyo Yeon: Well, first of all, I think the data that we have access to now is incredible. The kind of very specific nuances that we can get from data and analytics is amazing, and it really contributes to great, great design. That said, I think there’s still the qualitative, the intuitive, that special piece of inspiration that really takes it to the next level that I think is the magic of an amazing designer.', 'Empathizing with a user or customer is the key method or the key activity in great design that I don’t think is really translatable to data or analytics or any of those things. Design brings empathy into the problem-solving process. That’s the qualitative intangible.', 'Ben Sheppard: I completely agree. And I think there’s a piece around order here. Data is a great place to start for sources of insight. There is still absolutely room for that moment of inspiration, that moment of human connection to work at how to make a product or service stand out. I think what the research shows, though, is once you’ve got that great idea, do check it’s a great idea. Go back to the users. Test with them. Iterate. The best iteration is when you’re doing it using qualitative and quantitative techniques.', 'If you really want to understand your users when you’re designing something new, you can’t just rely on ethnographic research. You need to make use of new analytic tools to understand payment data, understand click-through data, understand warranty analysis to get under the skin of users, and frankly, find out things they might not even know themselves.', 'Simon London: Put yourself in the shoes of a general manager, an executive committee member who’s maybe not responsible for design function, has no particular design background. Are there some takeaways, Monday morning actions, things I can do differently to help raise design thinking, design process in the organization?', 'Ben Sheppard: Absolutely. If you want to start, don’t try to do all four themes at an organizational level all at once. That is a path to ruin. It makes much more sense to choose an individual product or service which is really important and use that as your pilot for these four themes.', 'If you don’t even have time for that, if you want to start something on Monday, there are actions you can take before even doing this on a product or service. One of the examples that we loved from the research we saw was from a consumer-packaged-goods company. The CEO really wanted to accelerate the focus on users. He felt that they’d lost touch with the users and they were just talking about financial metrics.', 'He walked into the room and said, “This Christmas, half of your bonus is going to be tied to how many stars out of five our products get on Amazon.” Is that a perfect metric? Absolutely not. It’s very crude. But instead of creating a cottage industry in design metrics, it fundamentally changed the discussion in the boardroom to say, “How will this affect our users,” and had exactly the cultural effect he wanted to kick-start the discussion.', 'Simon London: So look for ways that you can promote user centricity, customer centricity in your organization. And where next for the research?', 'Ben Sheppard: The research is a start rather than the finish. We’re excited about putting it out into the world. It brings with it world firsts. However, many people are going to be asking themselves the question, “How do we stack up in terms of design?”', 'We’ll be putting out the data from this research in a form that’s useful for business leaders. They’ll be able to go online, test their own design actions over the past years. And that will be consolidated into a single number, a single score on their design performance. That will be their McKinsey Design Index score.', 'They’ll be able to see how that score compares to the other 300 companies who were compared here. They’ll be able to see where they’re strong, where they may have capabilities that they can focus on, and crucially, “What’s the value at stake here?” If they decide to go for this, if they decide, “We want to be top-quartile design performers,” what could the financial benefits be?', 'Simon London: So there’s going to be a diagnostic. There’s going to be an instrument out there, so to speak, that is going to be available to all comers.', 'Ben Sheppard: That’s the plan. We want to make this widely available. I think this is an important way to kick-start the conversations between design leaders and business leaders.', 'Simon London: I’m afraid we’re out of time for today. But a big thank you to Ben and to Hyo for being with us today.', 'Hyo Yeon: It’s a pleasure.', 'Ben Sheppard: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And as always, a big thank you to you, our listeners.

76,How to win in Africa,https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/how-to-win-in-africa,"The right strategy can unlock strong, profitable growth, explain the authors of Africa’s Business Revolution.","['The right strategy can unlock strong, profitable growth, explain the authors of Africa’s Business Revolution.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey senior partners Acha Leke and Georges Desvaux about the opportunity before companies to develop and grow their businesses in Africa.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. When you think about Africa, what comes to mind? It’s hard not to be swayed by years of news reports of crisis and conflict. But as we’ll hear, another narrative is starting to take hold. It’s one centered on urbanization, technology, rising incomes, and better government. It’s a story told compellingly in a new book, Africa’s Business Revolution, coauthored by McKinsey partners Acha Leke and Georges Desvaux and McKinsey alumnus Mutsa Chironga. I was lucky enough to catch up with Acha and Georges in person for a wide-ranging conversation about Africa’s business scene today, how and why it’s changing, and why Africa might just be the world’s next great growth market.', 'Georges and Acha, welcome to the podcast, thanks for being here.', 'Acha Leke: Thanks for having us.', 'Georges Desvaux: Delighted to be with you.', 'Simon London: Imagine for a minute that I’m running a big multinational company. I’ve got options to invest in many different parts of the world. Why should I prioritize Africa? Why should I be thinking about scaling up in Africa in particular?', 'Acha Leke: If you’re a multinational company, there’s no better place to invest in than in Africa. If you think of the continent today, it’s young, it’s fast growing, and it’s urbanizing. Half of Africans are under the age of 19, so if you’re taking a long-term, ten-, 20-, 30-year view, where else do you want to be?', 'The continent is going to add another billion or so Africans over the next 20 to 30 years (Interactive). We’ll have the largest working population, larger than China, in 6,000 days. And it’s urbanizing, so we’re the fastest-urbanizing region in the world. Every year we have 24 million Africans moving to cities. To reach them is not that difficult. You decide to focus on a few critical cities.', 'As you put all that together, when you take a long-term view as a consumer-facing company, it’s hard to think of a better place. I’ll give an example. In Nigeria alone, there are more babies born every year than in the whole of Western Europe. If you’re a diaper company, where would you want to be based?', 'Georges Desvaux: It’s a little like thinking about whether [companies] should have gone into China 25 years ago. Having lived in China at the time, you can see the parallels playing out in Africa. It’s roughly the same population but also what I find quite extraordinary is the level of energy, the level of development. When you go to a city like Lagos, you really think you are in China 25 years ago.', 'When you look at this and you look at the energy, the entrepreneurship, the drive, it will probably take a different shape and form, but it will actually develop. There are two differences which I think are very important: in Africa, the young population, as Acha mentioned, will drive the development on a different scale because we’ll get to two billion people in the next 20 years.', 'Second is the availability of technology. Where Africa is, contrary to where China was 25 years ago, is actually leapfrogging in many places with technology and that opens up a lot more opportunities that people may not have seen at this stage.', 'Acha Leke: I’ll add one thing that we mentioned in the book: we talked a lot about the population growth. But you also think about the growth of disposable income because what we’re finding is there’s GDP growth and that’s translating into disposable-income growth. When you combine those two factors, it’s more like exponential growth than linear growth. There are very few places in the world today where you will really get those two factors coming together that strongly.', 'Simon London: You two must spend a lot of time talking with clients about Africa and the Africa opportunity. What are some of the misconceptions that you hear as you do that?', 'Acha Leke: I would say there’s a big difference between perception of risk versus the reality on the ground. A lot of clients who are not based on the continent tend to read the news and the sensational headlines you hear. And their view of the risk is quite different from what’s on the ground. I used to have a client, a downstream oil company, and they said, “Look, we’re in 30 countries. Every year five will blow up, but we don’t know which ones. But the other 25 will do great.” What they always told me was, “But we love being in Africa because we do very well. And so we’re very happy for people out there to think Africa is too risky.” They would come into the market, and they would have less competition. There’s a big difference between perceived risk and the reality on the ground.', 'Georges Desvaux:  And the other thing that I think people fail to realize is how important Africa already is in terms of the industrial or private sector. It is in fact doing quite well. We surveyed companies to understand how big they are in Africa. When we would ask executives in Africa or outside of Africa how many companies do you think have revenues of more than $1 billion a year, most people would argue between 50 and a hundred.', 'Acha Leke:  Many wouldn’t even say ten.', 'Georges Desvaux:  Some would say ten. And the reality is there are more than 400 of them. Not only are they large institutions but on top of that they tend to grow faster than their peers in the world and be at least as profitable. It’s actually a healthy place if you know what you’re doing and if you know how to capture the opportunity.', 'Simon London:  You’re dead right. I read the book, and I was very surprised to find that number, 400 companies with over a billion dollars of revenue.', 'Acha Leke:  There are only two people who have gotten that number right, and each time we do the presentation we typically ask, “How many such companies do you think exist?” The last time I did it was actually in Barcelona two weeks ago, and the answer we got was between ten and 20. Typically they tell us 50 to 100, one of the two people who have gotten it right was Aliko Dangote, who has a good feel for what’s going on in the continent as we know. He is the richest African and the richest black man in the world. But very few people realize the extent of how big the private sector is and the scale of the kind of companies you can build on the continent.', 'Georges Desvaux:  And part of the reason why they don’t realize how big the private sector is is because 70 percent of those companies are African. If you’re African, you know. Africans CEOs figured out and are very happy with what’s happening and what they are able to achieve. But the rest of the world typically underestimates what’s happening because they heard about all the failures, and the ones who are active and successful tend to be quite understated.', 'Simon London:  Just to be devil’s advocate, the political risk is very real as you pointed out, Acha. There are certain countries, in any given five-year period where there will be more political risk and volatility than there might be in some other regions of the world. How do you respond to that? As a CEO, how do you manage around that?', 'Acha Leke:  Let’s be clear: there are risks. Political is one, so we urge our clients simply to think not just from a growth perspective but also combine growth and risk. When you do that you see three very clear sets of countries that emerge. There are the countries that are quite stable and growing fast. And that tends to be the East African and the francophone African countries. So the Rwandas and the Ethiopias of the world, but also you see some countries like Cote d’Ivoire, Morocco, countries like that. Then you have some that are what we call vulnerable growers, so they’re still growing but they’ve been exposed to some of the shocks. The oil shocks affected places like Nigeria and Angola.', 'Then you have a set of countries that have struggled to just grow. Places like South Africa. Those are the three segments, and in the past as an executive looking at the continent you could literally go anywhere and you’d find growth. Now you have to be a lot more granular, a lot more careful because there are pockets of growth where it’s more important to really understand the situation on the ground. Because when you find growth, you have to really get a better sense for how the countries are doing but how the sector even is doing in the country you’re interested in.', 'Georges Desvaux:  You also have to look at it and say, this is a long-term play. This is a 20-, 30-years play. It’s the same as China was 30 years ago, India was 15 years ago. Africa is going to be the next pillar of growth because of demographics, because of the natural resources, because of urbanization. And so what you need to do is you need to build the resilience that enables you to manage the risks that are inherent to those three different types of countries that Acha was talking about in order to make sure you are able to go through and weather the storms at some point.', 'Because you take a country like Nigeria, for example, which many people would say, “Well, it’s difficult, it’s dangerous, there are risks, there is Boko Haram, there are issues.” But there are 180 million inhabitants, with a striving group of entrepreneurs who are really driving very hard to develop their own enterprises, and that’s a force that you cannot ignore.', 'And you have that with Nigeria, you have Ethiopia with about 90 million people. You have the whole francophone West Africa, which is another 100 million, so those are massive places where people are really trying hard to develop and build their economies.', 'Acha Leke:  Definitely, I think diversifying your portfolio makes sense. What we’ve found is the most successful companies have typically been across multiple countries because like I said, you just never know when something could happen. If you look at the multinationals that have been most successful, they’ve been in ten or more countries and they’ve been here for a long time. So that’s one. But the second thing, which is important, is we’ve also realized in building these companies that have revenues over a billion dollars, it’s very difficult to build a billion-dollar business if you’re not in one of three economies.', 'If not in South Africa, Nigeria, or Egypt, it’s just very difficult, you just don’t have enough scale. As you think about diversifying your portfolio think also about what is the role that one or many of these three countries will play in that portfolio.', 'Simon London:  Just talk a little bit more about what it takes to win in Africa. The backbone of the book is building for resilience in your strategy, taking that into account. That’s clearly a lever. What are the other things that jump out to you? What’s the secret sauce?', 'Acha Leke:  A lot of the book was focused on what’s the secret sauce. We found four elements to that and I’ll bring them all together, and we’ll talk about each (Exhibit 1). One was, as Georges talked about, mapping your Africa strategy, which is very much about where to play. Which countries should you play in? Do you want to do what I call a Vodacom strategy?', '', 'Or do you want a MTN strategy , which is to go across multiple countries at once? You can be very successful at either one, but you need to pick. We always say if you’re a consumer-facing company, think cities not countries. So what 20 cities do you want to be in versus what five countries? But that’s really about, where do you want to play?', 'Then after there’s innovating a business model. What parts do you want to innovate in? We’ve seen a number of places who have innovated in products and services. We’ve seen others who could leverage technology to innovate. So you have to think about is it just driving costs down to really be one of the lowest-cost producers?', 'There’s a third element that we’ve talked about, and that’s the resilience. How are you going to build resilience? How do you make sure that you’re here for the long term, because you’re going to have ups and downs. It’s a continent. There are 54 countries. Through ups and downs, how do you build resilience?', 'And within that is what parts of the value chain do you want to control? We’ve seen a lot of companies that have been successful have had to insource a lot of work they would typically outsource in other markets because they need to gain control of that. And then fourth is talent. How are you going to build the talent you need? And each of these on its own is not rocket science.', 'But I’ll say two things: where we’ve seen companies that have been successful, they’ve been able to be successful across each of those four elements. They’ve known exactly where to play, they’ve been very careful about where they’re going to innovate, they’ve been very careful about how they build resilience. And they’ve found a way to really grow talent.', 'The second thing we found, which is actually quite interesting for us, is the most successful companies have come up at it from wanting to do the right thing for the continent. So it’s about what we call doing good by doing well. They didn’t come here just because they wanted to make money. They said, “I want to solve a problem and on the back of that I will make money.” You have a longer-term perspective. You have a mind-set of really trying to make a difference and improving people’s lives. And on the back of that also being a quite successful company for its shareholders.', 'Georges Desvaux:  One thing that’s very clear in Africa is you need to really think hard about the product and services and be able ready to innovate. You could say that in most markets in the world, but I think it’s particularly relevant in Africa because the needs are going to be quite local. You need to think about colors and taste and price points, and so it’s not about replicating a business model or services that has worked somewhere else.', 'There’s an example of this Chinese company that was making smartphones for Africa. They are dedicated to building them for Africa. What they did is they modified the camera’s features so that they can give better rendering for people with dark skin because that is something that is appealing to African consumers. So you really need to go down into the details, in the trenches of what really matters for African consumers, if you want to be relevant to them.', 'Acha Leke:  Equity Bank is a bank in Kenya. What Equity has been able to do is provide banking services to millions and millions of Kenyans. What they did is leverage technology, and so they didn’t go out to build a bunch of branches. Africa has the highest number of mobile money subscribers around the world; 100 million Africans use mobile money. That’s because there’s leapfrogging in that sector. They were not building branches. So that’s one.', 'But you see a lot of technology innovation across sectors. We started seeing it in the financial-services space. We’re seeing it in energy. So at the time when you want to get energy through a region, you had to build these transmission lines all the way to villages. You would never be able to make a return on your investment. Governments didn’t have money to build it. But now with some systems such as BBOXX and a number of other solar-home-system players leveraging mobile technology and leveraging mobile payment, you can literally buy a solar home system for yourself, take a loan for it and pay on a daily basis, and then pay it off, and on the back of that you can get a loan for another product. (See Exhibit 2 for an example of a solar home system.)', '', 'Simon London:  Talk a little bit more about this whole concept of choosing where to play in the value chain, and in some cases actually integrating. Just talk a little bit more about why that might matter in the Africa context, and maybe a couple of examples?', 'Georges Desvaux:  This notion of getting a real understanding of where in the value chain you need to create control and quality is very important to success. For example, in e-commerce for a company like Jumia, they will also try to control and improve their last mile and be able to deliver because they have to do it the same way that Alibaba and Tencent did it in China. They were placated because you can’t get the last mile, so you have to control it and you have to have the right service level and you have the right security, safety for the goods, and so on and so forth. So in some cases you just have to have it in order to give the right level of customer satisfaction.', 'Simon London:  And Jumia is Africa’s e-commerce giant or trying to become Africa’s e-commerce giant?', 'Georges Desvaux:  So Jumia is replicating the whole idea of the e-commerce that has happened in China. They have 400,000 merchants online. It’s developing very well, and it serves a need. The need is interesting because we talked a bit earlier about why would that work? Part of the reason and what they’ve found in Jumia is that a lot more of their sales came from the rural areas than expected. They expected everything to come from urban areas, and part of the reason is because there is no availability of retail stores.', 'People who have decent income in more rural areas, they don’t have the time, they can’t really access an urban center, and they’re very happy to transact online as long as they can get the delivery there. And so you come back to how do you guarantee—', 'Simon London:  And that’s the last mile?', 'Georges Desvaux: And that’s the last mile.', 'Simon London:  So Amazon or whoever you can rely on, the United States Postal Service, or UPS, or whoever does your deliveries, but that’s not available in rural Africa so they have to own that piece of the value chain.', 'Acha Leke:  We always talk about Dangote. Twelve years ago, Nigeria imported all of its cement. Every bit of cement was imported and then-Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had this discussion with him. He said, “What’s it going to take for your cement importers to produce locally?” And Dangote said, “Well, give us an incentive to produce locally.” What they decided was to implement what they called backward-integration policy. They said they’d only give licenses to import cement to those who can show them that they’re building cement plants.', 'They said, “This year you can import X amount and that’s going to decrease every year. And after four years, you shouldn’t import anything else. You won’t have a license to import because your plant should be up and running.” Fast forward: today Nigeria is a net exporter of cement. So they produce enough for the local market, and they export it, and they’ve created the richest black man in the world.', 'So there’s a big piece around import substitution. That’s very important for our countries. We still import billions of dollars of food every year across the continent. And how much of that can you produce locally. That’s important. And then as a company what you then need to do once you decide where you want to play there is understand how much of your inputs you need to control because of the inefficiencies in the ports; the inefficient infrastructure is a problem.', 'Dangote, for example, has 10,000 trucks to go deliver the cement in more advanced markets. He could outsource that to somebody. But that’s a huge competitive advantage to him, understanding where your company’s advantage is and how you can control that.', 'Georges Desvaux:  There is a massive need for producing locally for local demand. We estimate that there’s about $500 billion worth of industrial manufacturing in Africa. We believe it could be doubled within a decade.', 'Simon London:  So to a trillion?', 'Georges Desvaux:  Roughly a trillion. But of that, contrary to what China was 30 years ago, in Africa, two-thirds would be for local consumption. All of this can be produced, and it’s an opportunity that, for example, Chinese companies have seized. In Ethiopia, you have the largest ceramic tile factory in Africa and it was built by a Chinese company. It is one of the market leaders. And that has been replicated many times. So there’s also this notion of just going where the needs are and building the right service model because the demand is there.', 'Acha Leke:  It was funny because of that $500 billion of products that are manufactured today, Chinese companies account for about 12 percent. These are not products manufactured in China and imported on the continent. These are Chinese companies like the ceramic tile manufacturer based in Angola, in Kenya, in Cameroon, in Senegal, manufacturing locally about 12 percent of Africa’s full production.', 'Simon London:  I was going to ask you about that because there’s been some McKinsey research when one reads about it in the media as well. On the ground, it’s a very real phenomenon?', 'Georges Desvaux:  China in Africa is incredibly real. It’s interesting because I think there are a lot of myths about Chinese presence because what’s generally reported is the whole infrastructure project and the project financing by the Chinese government and all of this, which does exist. But what I think is misunderstood is the sheer economic presence from the Chinese private sector. Our own research, we had to interview a thousand Chinese companies in Chinese to understand what really was happening.', 'We believe there are about 10,000 Chinese companies operating in Africa. But 85 percent of them are private and they’re private because these are Chinese entrepreneurs who 25 years ago in China built a manufacturing plant for flip-flops or for ceramic tiles. They realized that they can replicate this because they look at the market, there is a market, there is demand. There is just no supply. And so they build it. It’s beneficial for Africa because about 85 percent of their employees are African. It is really an economic force that is misunderstood very often.', 'Simon London:  So, as you say, the Chinese entrepreneurs, they’re creating a lot of jobs. They’re actually leveraging local talent. It’s one of the themes of the book, as you mentioned, Acha. It’s part of the secret sauce is that getting the talent right on the ground in Africa. Again, imagine I’m a CEO, what’s the advice you give to me about how I think about talent in Africa?', 'Georges Desvaux:  One of the things that always has been striking for me is, and quite different, I would say than Asia, to draw the parallel, is very senior leadership or top talent. You have very, very good talent in Africa. Very well educated. They went to all the best universities, come back, and there is a passion to be there. You also have the people at the front line who are extremely ambitious, want to develop, and they don’t always have the right craftsmanship.', 'What’s really going to be a struggle for most people is going to be to develop the intermediary talent and to develop leadership over time. And that is really one of the challenges that we’ve heard many times. And so some people like Jumia, for example, have created a university to try to build their own middle management and build them over time. Some other people like an oil company, for example, is building technical and vocational training to create whole families of mechanics who can then open up their own garages that can then use the right products. The challenge is going to be around vocational talent and early management.', 'Acha Leke:  I think I would agree. Over time as a multinational the question is, how do you Africanize your talent, right, and make it much more African? Some companies like GE and Standard Chartered, have been very, very successful. So there’s a way to do it. To Georges’s point, for the frontline workers, just also rethinking a bit what success looks like and what are the markers for success in these candidates? And take a bit of risk.', 'Simon London: And being prepared to be flexible, to do some investment where you might not do it in other parts of the world. And to your point, Georges, thinking long term as well.', 'Georges Desvaux:  That’s going to take time to grow the talent and it has to be part of your strategy from day one. What you need to put in place is systems and the processes to make sure it happens. You give them the opportunities, give them the right coaching, the right training, and then when you do that, it grows over time. But the other thing about talent is an opportunity that’s linked to diversity and gender diversity. You have a very strong talent pool with women, and women in Africa are already playing an important role in the economic society. That’s also an area where you have an immense potential to develop talent and to develop strong African women leaders. Some of them are very impressive whether they’re in the governments or others. They’re quite influential. It is an area where I think, especially for multinationals, you have access to terrific talent.', 'Simon London:  A lot of our conversation so far has been very positive and rightly very positive. There’s a lot to play for in Africa clearly. But there are also some pretty big barriers to doing business in Africa. What’s the reality of doing business on the ground and what are some of the barriers just to getting things done?', 'Acha Leke:  There are clear barriers. Infrastructure is one. Look at the continent today, we are spending $80 billion a year on infrastructure. We used to spend $40 billion but we need to spend $150 billion. Infrastructure gets in the way, whether it’s power, or it’s roads, or it’s airports, ports, across any asset class. We’re completely underindexed relative to any other emerging market. There are ways around it, but that’s a barrier.', 'Ease of doing business if you look at the World Bank rankings. Many of the African countries are at the bottom of that ranking. A number have improved significantly. Nigeria, for example, went up 24 places last year.', 'Rwanda has been a darling, as Mauritius has been. A lot of countries are making efforts to reform and make the business realm an easier.', 'Simon London:  And ease of doing business to be practical is?', 'Acha Leke:  Permitting. Starting the company. Paying taxes. Getting access to electricity for your business. All the normal things that business would expect that will be provided to them. Progress has been made on that but still a lot more needs to be made. Corruption is another issue that people talk about a lot on the continent, which is real. But it takes two to tango in this front as well, so it’s not just blaming the government.', 'There are a number of challenges, but those who have been successful have been those who have been able to take these challenges and recast them as opportunity. Because behind every challenge is an opportunity, and that’s what differentiates the winners from the losers.', 'Georges Desvaux:  Those barriers are real. But you have to take them into the perspective of, are they being addressed? Are they improving? The regional groupings—East Africa community, inside those regions, you can see the trade going up 15 percent or more. (See Exhibit 3 for a look at the eight economic communities on the continent.) Things are progressing, and to some extent, they remind me a little bit of the early days of China and Southeast Asia, where, in 2000, if you wanted to deliver trucks from Beijing to Guangzhou, you’d take two or three weeks and you had to stop at every border, at every provincial border. And there are no highways. That’s where you are. But, it will get there, and you can find ways around it in the meantime. And then as the barriers improve, your business opportunity will continue.', '', 'Acha Leke: And I’ll give you another example: travel across Africa. McKinsey has been working in partnership with the African Development Bank and World Economic Forum on this because if we’re going to—we could talk about Africa, but it’s 54 countries. To be able to increase intra-Africa trade, the 75 percent of manufacturing for which there are opportunities in Africa needs to circulate across the continent. We need people to be able to travel around.', 'Five years ago, we did this analysis and we showed then that, on average, an African needed visas for 60 percent of African countries. At the time, a European needed visas for 52 percent of African countries and an American needed visas for 45 percent of African countries. So it was easier for an American or European to travel across the continent. There were only five countries that allowed any African to travel—either you could go there without a visa or you could just get it on arrival. Only five. And we’ve been doing a lot of work, and we published a report every year that now the African Development Bank publishes called African Visa Openness Index, and the good news is today we have 20 countries. We’re up to 20 that allow visa-free access to any African. That’s out of 54 countries, so we still have a long way to go. But that’s the kind of progress that has been made in five years. You already see a lot of impact on tourism, so a lot of impact on intra-Africa trade, and just travel from Africans visiting those countries. We’re hoping to see much more of that going forward.', 'Simon London:  I know there’s ambitions for an Africa-wide free-trade area. Do we think that’s going to happen in reality, and it’s been approved in principle but now needs to be ratified.', 'Acha Leke:  It’s happening, we have a lot more countries. I think South Africa has actually signed up now. I think the only big country that hasn’t signed up now is Nigeria. So it’s going to happen. I think we realize it’s 54 countries, and for us to really grow as a continent, we need one big economic community for us to be able to speak to a China or speak to an India. India and China each have the same amount of people, but it’s one country. Under the leadership of African Union Chairman Paul Kagame, we got it ratified, which is great. You need a lot more countries to come on board. You need it passed by the local parliaments, but we’re going to get there because everybody realizes that that is critical for us to be able to carry our weight as a continent globally.', 'Simon London:  I think that’s all we have time for, but, Acha Leke and Georges Desvaux, thank you very much for joining us. Great conversation.', 'Acha Leke:  Thank you for having us. We’re looking forward to seeing many more companies accessing the African opportunity.', 'Georges Desvaux:  Thank you again, and we hope that you will enjoy the book and that it will draw your interest into very practical actions to be present in Africa.', 'Simon London:  And thanks as always to you, our listeners.

New research highlights the role of public policy, effective government, and globally competitive companies.","['Why do some emerging economies grow rapidly while others languish? New research highlights the role of public policy, effective government, and globally competitive companies.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Simon London speaks with McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) director Jonathan Woetzel and MGI partner Anu Madgavkar about their recent research on emerging economies that outperform others based on pro-growth agendas and successful companies that help propel them.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Why do some countries develop economically while others remain poor? Is economic development determined by geography or demography? Is it even possible without democracy? And what’s the role of free-market principles—whatever those might be? To answer these questions, I caught up with the coauthors of a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute entitled Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies and the companies that propel them. Jonathan Woetzel is a McKinsey partner based in Shanghai. Anu Madgavkar is a partner based in Mumbai. For this conversation I was lucky enough to intercept them both in New York.', 'Anu, Jonathan, thanks for being here today.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: It’s great to be here. Thank you, Simon.', 'Anu Madgavkar: Great to be here. Thanks.', 'Simon London: The obvious first question is, who are the outperformers?', 'Anu Madgavkar: We looked at over 70 emerging economies, and we set a threshold of which economies have delivered sustained per capita GDP growth over long periods of time. Over 50 years this amounted to a set of seven economies, which includes China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and then a set of economies in Southeast Asia, which is Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. These seven did it over 50 years, and then there’s another set of 11, which delivered high growth over a shorter period of about 20 years [Exhibit 1].', '', 'Simon London: All of those seven are clustered in Asia. They’re the names we know, but they’re all in Asia. So is there a sense in which geography is destiny? Is that part of the message?', 'Anu Madgavkar: It’s interesting to look at the recent outperformers, which is the set of 11 that took off and delivered growth over the last 20 years. Because that’s actually a more diversified set. You do have countries in Southeast Asia, like Vietnam and Cambodia. You do have India. And then you have a set of countries which are in Central Asia, which is Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and so on. And then one African economy. There is a bit more of regional or geographic diversity in that set. But it probably is true that there are strong advantages of having growth taking off in the form of, let’s say, a big anchor economy or an economy that leads in a region. We have seen some of that. But growth has actually been more diversified in the last 20 years.', 'Simon London: And in Asia presumably that’s China. China is the big anchor economy. And there is a sense in which some of the other economies have been able to go on the coattails of China, is that right?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: China trade—“China-south” and “China-north”—trade has been the fastest growing piece of global trade. It is an anchor, as you say.', 'But more broadly, as Anu was saying, I think we do say that there is an approach to growth. There is an approach to outperformance which is common to these East Asian economies. But it is more than that. It goes beyond borders. And it’s something that any country can achieve. That’s the message: there’s an approach and there’s an agenda that is open to all.', 'Simon London: Let’s double-click on that. Having an anchor economy close by is helpful, but there is a recipe here. There’s commonality across countries that achieve growth over the long term. What’s the recipe?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: We think it has two parts. Let’s talk about the policy, which I’m hesitant to call policy—but let’s say the agenda, the things that we all agree on in an outperforming economy. And essentially the main thing is we agree on growth. And it’s quite surprising in some cases that some economies do not agree on growth. So it’s apparently not well aligned.', 'But in a high-performing economy, what we see is an alignment around productivity, income, and demand [Exhibit 2]. These are the three aspects that drive economic growth. Productivity to enable better resource-allocation decisions. Income to create return of that productive investment to the people who created it, the workers or the investors and the shareholders. And demand being the reinvestment of that income into new productivity. These things go together: productivity, income, and demand. And that is the first and most important takeaway from why these economies outperform. They agreed on that, and they created policies and mechanisms to support that.', '', 'The second thing we note is that large competitive global companies are a hallmark of these outperforming economies. We can argue whether it’s causal or correlated. But we can certainly say that these companies have to be there. We need to see large, globally competitive companies emerging to 50 percent, 60 percent revenue as a share of GDP, or 40 percent value added as a share of GDP, in order for us to see an outperforming economy. Those two things: a pro-growth agenda and globally competitive companies.', 'Anu Madgavkar: These two things are not just the common features that we saw across these outperformer economies but also went hand in hand. So just like Jonathan said, it’s not clear which was the cause and which was the effect. But there was something like a shared vision that was created around the idea of the importance of growth, the importance of creating a climate in which savings and investment could happen, and that these companies could actually invest, accumulate capital, build productive capacity, and open up to the rest of the economy.', 'It did take some doing. This is not something that happened automatically or naturally or easily, perhaps, but with a concerted set of actions that actually had policy makers sitting with the private sector charting out what could be done, let’s say, to drive up exports in a certain sector or economy-wide. Then they followed a shared agenda around that with the right incentives in place—a fairly concerted set of actions to bring these multiple different actors together.', 'Simon London: I know we don’t want to get too deep into policy making. It’s up to the countries to decide, clearly, but what are the common levers around something like encouraging a high savings rate within an economy and capital accumulation? What are some of the things that we see consistently across high-growth economies?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I think you put your finger first of all on a very important one, which is savings rates and the ability to mobilize savings, which implies two things. One is a belief in the value of those savings. That the savings will go to create some future wealth in store. And the second is the security of those savings. Those savings are not something that you have to keep under your mattress at home but you will actually put into a bank account.', 'The policy first of all is to create the financial system that allows that. So you have to have financial inclusion. You have to have some type of a very broad-based financial network that allows for everybody, farmers to workers to rich and poor, to have security against those deposits.', 'Then you need to have a way of insuring that what that savings is used for can ultimately create value. The return on that investment, that’s where you see the takeoff in manufacturing. The ability to start small-scale manufacturing enterprises, which have access to the marketplace. You see investments of course in real estate. The ability to secure title and see that there’s a medium-term opportunity for you to get this money back so you’re willing to put the investment into the savings vehicle.', 'It boils down to saying, “Yes, we have to have a broad-based financial network. And we have to have the security for the investor.” Those two things add up to an incentive to save. Without those we of course see very low savings rates, and those are characteristics of the non-outperformers.', 'Anu Madgavkar: One of the myths I think about emerging economies is that a lot of the investment is led by FDI.', 'Simon London: FDI being foreign direct investment.', 'Anu Madgavkar: Foreign direct investment. And while that is true, FDI has played an important role particularly in bringing new know-how and new technology and linking local companies to global markets. But just in terms of quantum of capital accumulation, it’s really domestic savings that dominate across all the cases that we’ve seen.', 'There is no substitute in the medium to long term to building the financial institutions, trust, credibility, and financial inclusion and to deepening your domestic savings and investment markets. There really is no substitute for doing that.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: If I could add one other that I think is just incredibly important: the productivity aspect of policy. Productivity sometimes is thought of more as, first of all, an automation and a job-cutting mechanism, and I think that, of course, technological innovation and renovation is an aspect of it. But that’s in turn impelled by pro-competition policies.', 'It’s actually the opening of markets and the selective uses of everything from tariffs and quotas and reductions in them to market-availability mechanisms. Saying we allow for this market to be open to private competition, in particular, versus that one to be not yet available.', 'These levers have been used very purposefully by the outperforming economies to gradually over time open up and deregulate and create a market-based economic benchmark. We call it contested leadership. These markets feature contests for who will be the leading company. Those contests are held on economic grounds saying, “Who can achieve a faster rate of coverage for your telecom network? Who can be more successful in an export market?”', 'Simon London: That was going to be one of my questions about the growth of large companies in these economies. From the outside in, I would say to myself, “Well, of course. These are government selected. They’re picking winners. These are protected. They’re oligopolies.” But actually, the research shows that’s not the case, right?', 'Anu Madgavkar: No, that’s not the case at all, because per trillion dollars of GDP, so for the size of each of these economies, they have more companies in this $0.5 billion-plus revenue bracket that we consider large companies.', 'Simon London: So that’s our definition, if you’d like, of a large company, just for the sake of argument, is $0.5 billion of revenue and above.', 'Anu Madgavkar: These outperformers have more such companies. There is more dynamism or churn in terms of who the winners are. We looked at this in terms of saying, “Well, which are the companies that actually perform best in terms of economic profit generation, let’s say ten or 15 years ago?” Of the companies that were leaders at that point, how many of them remained in the top quintile in terms of economic profit generation ten or 15 years later?', 'What we found is that the rate of dislodging of companies and new companies entering that leadership bracket was much higher in the outperformers compared to the advanced economies, for example.', 'Simon London: So there is this sense of creative destruction in action. And if anything, more creative destruction than you might see among the top echelons.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: That’s a great point, Simon. I think that we actually did then look at the firms themselves, to and see whether what we can observe at the firm level—in terms of their management practices and whether that would support this thesis—that there was greater churn and more dynamism.', 'What we found, interestingly enough, is that yes, in fact, these high-performing emerging economies feature large competitive companies [Exhibit 3], and, relative to their OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] counterparts, they are more digital. They are growing faster, they are investing faster. They have higher capital productivity. They have higher rates of new product introduction. These are real global contenders. We would contend that this is the birth of the new set of global competitors. If we look down the line in ten, 20 years, the majority of global competitors will be from emerging markets.', '', 'Anu Madgavkar: What’s interesting about them is that they’re not just looking at their own markets. They’re increasingly looking at the world as the place to play. You have seen very large multinationals coming out of some of these outperformers. And it’s not just the outperformer economies. You do see these high-performance, high-growth companies coming up in some of the non-outperforming economies too. There are winners there as well.', 'It’s more a challenge of how can those economies make the effort to scale up many more such companies. But you do have winners. Some really interesting stories. For example, one of the largest bakery brands in the US is a Mexican company that owns I think six out of 12 of the largest bread brands in the US. Or the Korean cosmetics companies which have gone global. There are big global aspirations on the part of many of these companies backed by some of the nimbleness and agility that Jonathan talked about in terms of investment.', 'Simon London: Just to make sure that I understand, part of our argument is that the growth of large companies is something of a development economics lever. And maybe that’s been underappreciated until now. Is that broadly what we’re saying?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: We can say, first of all, it’s certainly a feature. Large corporations we know are important for exports. They are more capable of tapping in historically to that demand. Improvements in the performance of large companies leads to improvements in the performance of small companies. There’s a value chain which is associated with it. They pay higher wages so it supports income. And there is more use of R&D, higher levels of our research and technology investments. All of this would say that this is a form of market-based organization, let’s say that does drive productivity, increases income, and supports demand. Not every company is as productive and as competitive as the leaders that we’ve seen in these outperforming economies.', 'Companies in and of themselves, this may or may not lead you to those results. But the pro-growth agenda, which is again the policy side of the compact, the things that we believe about how an economy should work, combined with these entrepreneurial energies, creates an outperforming economy.', 'Simon London: Are we essentially saying here that a free-market set of policies, throwing the economy open to global competition, letting big companies fend for themselves, is that the recipe that we see at work or is it actually something a little more subtle?', 'Anu Madgavkar: The governments in many of these outperformer economies have played a very active role, so I’m not sure we should characterize it as a purely laissez-faire or free-market type of approach. There has been a large amount of effort put into figuring out what aspects of global experience are relevant for the country at that point in time.', 'While all these economies and policy makers did try to get the best thinking from the world, there was equally a strong desire to shape that and adapt that to the conditions which were prevalent. Going back to the earlier point around savings—there was a fairly big role played by governments to almost do forced savings, which is to create conditions in which capital was available relatively cheaply to companies.', 'This may not have happened had it been a completely free-market system. That’s just one example where policies were adapted and developed which were consistent with the stage of development of the economy at that point in time.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I think it’s fair to say that many of these economies are still in the relatively early stages of their development. They’re moving from agriculture into industrialization. In that process, many times there’s been market failure. There simply hasn’t been private capital available to invest.', 'And so government has taken up the slack in terms of fixed assets and infrastructure investments, economic-development zones, and to some extent the actual development of what initially are state enterprises. Over time then privatizing or corporatizing them, as the case may be.', 'As Anu says, there’s a very active government role here. The productivity, the income, and the demand. But that said, I think the philosophy is clear. All these economies have embraced, if you will, market principles, in not only the operation of the market but even in how government itself operates. And government itself embraces this idea of contested leadership.', 'Simon London: Yes. And I guess from a political economy angle, there’s something here about government effectiveness. So, Anu, do you want to say a little bit more about the importance of that?', 'Anu Madgavkar: I think it’s fair to say first of all that government effectiveness had less to do with or little to do with the form of government. We did find a whole spectrum of different forms of government, and that wasn’t a big differentiator between the outperformers and the other economies that hadn’t actually achieved high growth. Among the outperformers, you do have single-party forms of government, like China or Vietnam. You do have democratic governments. And then you have India, which is a very diverse, very vibrant, and some might say noisy democracy. So you have all these flavors.', 'It didn’t have to do with a recipe of how governments come into power or how they conduct themselves but more how they think about economic growth and development. That is the focus of the research. We did not specifically look at questions of political effectiveness and human rights. We focus much more on understanding government effectiveness in terms of economic policies. Certainly, the form of government did not seem to be a differentiator there.', 'Simon London: So as far as we can tell, it’s not true that only democracies can succeed. But by the same token there’s no reason to believe that a noisy democracy such as India cannot succeed.', 'Anu Madgavkar: That was one of the very interesting findings that came out of this.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: I think that’s the key point: that it’s the trajectory that matters. It’s the rate of improvement. You start where you start. So some of our more recent economies are post–Civil War economies, so high levels of distrust and not much infrastructure.', 'But the fact that they have improved the quality of their governance or their transparency and that levels of corruption have been reduced, the ease of doing business has increased, and that in turn has been a hallmark we think of as creating the trust that enables demand. That’s a direct tie to the savings rate again.', 'Simon London: I thought one of the very interesting findings in the report that jumped out at me is the survey of senior managers in these various economies. And in your average developing economy, a senior manager will spend more than 10 percent of their time working on government or regulatory issues. In our outperformers, it’s only 5 percent. So that actually is a microexample of why this matters. It can bog down an economy.', 'Anu Madgavkar: It is frankly work in process for all economies, including the outperformers. There’s absolutely no room for complacence. Capital will flow where the enabling environment to deploy it productively exists. And this is as much a competition as anything else. I would say that even for the outperformers, particularly for some of the recent outperformers where ease of doing business is still a journey, that little factoid or microexample should serve to spur even more reform in that area.', 'Simon London: So let’s talk about trade. We hear a lot about globalization stalling, or in some cases, moving in reverse. Clearly trade has been a very important lever for our long-term outperformers. The question is, will it be a big lever for outperformers in the future?', 'Anu Madgavkar: If you look back at the last seven to eight years, it’s fair to say that at an aggregate level, so if you think about top-line, total trade, there seems to be this deceleration. It’s flat. It’s plateauing. People are concerned about deglobalization. But if you unpeel that onion a bit, there are two trends that are notable. Not all forms of trade are declining or flattening. Trade in services is rising. All sorts of data flows and information flows, which indirectly enable trade in services, are skyrocketing. If you strip away the pure commodity piece of goods trade, the rest is demonstrating healthy growth as well.', 'The second piece is to look at trade connections not necessarily with the advanced economies, or the OECD countries, but also among emerging economies, which we call south-south trade—though not all of these are in the Southern Hemisphere—but south-south trade is shorthand. If you look at cumulative trade within the emerging economies, that went up from something like 8 percent of global trade to 20 percent of global trade in the span of [about 20] years [Exhibit 4]. So there is rising growth there.', '', 'There are these big economies like China, which have created value chains and are sourcing more from the rest of the emerging economies and potentially importing for domestic consumption as well. We’ve seen labor-intensive exports from countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, rising at the rate of 20 to 30 percent, directed toward China. So in some ways there is the opportunity for China to become a new engine of consumption, which in turn creates more opportunities for south-south trade.', 'Simon London: Another thing that struck me in the research is that there’s not a lot in there, that I read anyway, around education. I would’ve thought that government investment in human capital and the labor force would be a big policy lever for development. Do you want to speak to that a little bit?', 'Anu Madgavkar: I think relative to the role that capital and technology and productivity growth have played, the role of quantity of labor to start with has been much smaller. There is another myth that says emerging economies grow fundamentally because they have lots of people and populations are growing.', 'Simon London: Well, there’s a demographic dividend, effectively.', 'Anu Madgavkar: That was certainly not the case. It was by far the productivity growth that dominated. That said, what we did find is that as you look at a host of different indicators, the amount that government spends on educating its workforce did show up as reasonably important.', 'But, again, because we start at different levels and because some of these economies actually aren’t that urbanized and don’t have high levels of education, what we did find is that successful companies—and sometimes whole sectors—have figured out how to take the labor supply that exists and upskill it to make it relevant and productive in the context of what you’re doing.', 'India’s IT sector is a good example. We did have a lot of tertiary-educated people entering the sector. But companies then figured out that to make them really employable and really productive, they did need to spend time and money upskilling them. They figured out that solution.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: To build on what Anu was saying, the labor markets themselves, the flexibility and the inclusivity and the mobility that you have, that’s really what differentiates these outperforming economies’ labor results, their income results from the non-outperformers.', 'It’s how well they include and they allow for everybody—the farthest-flung peasant to the inner-city worker—to get access to a value chain, an industry, a competitive sector, which then builds their skills. That flexibility and essentially allowing for the geographic mobility but also the cross-industry mobility.', 'The growth of new companies, the dynamism of the value chain, the opportunity for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises] to spring up and to create more employment opportunities, that’s the kind of education that really matters. The expenditures themselves, we didn’t see a high correlation there.', 'Simon London: Look into the future. If you think about the next generation of outperformers: Who are they? Where should we look?', 'Jonathan Woetzel: First of all, they’re a far-flung lot [Exhibit 5]. We believe that we will see the growth of the outperforming economies spread to every continent and that they are both large and small. There won’t be a straightforward correlation based on geography or size. Rather, it will again be driven by the policy agenda, the pro-growth agenda, and the emergence of these globally competitive companies in emerging markets. I can give away a few names but—', '', 'Simon London: Do. Give away a few names.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: It’s all in the report, but in Africa, Rwanda stands out as being an example of a small country which has delivered the GDP per capita growth—but also recently has a very robust set of institutions or I should say a robust agenda against these growth policies.', 'In Latin America we see Bolivia starting to show recent outperformance. The right policies and agenda in place. With any of these types of predictions, of course, it’s just that. It’s just a prediction. What we base it on essentially is the recent GDP per capita growth and an assessment of the elements of their policy agenda. Those are what we see as the potential for the next wave of outperformers.', 'Simon London: Fantastic. Well, I think we’re out of time for today. But, Anu and Jonathan, thanks so much.', 'Jonathan Woetzel: Thank you very much.', 'Anu Madgavkar: Thank you.', 'Simon London: And thanks, as always, to you, our listeners.

I’m Lucia Rahilly, sitting in for the podcast’s regular host, Simon London. Today, we discuss new research on a hotly contested topic that affects all of us, from leaders right on down the line: performance management, or how we define, evaluate, and reward success on the job, including the much-dreaded, often-derided, and, in recent years, sometimes discarded, annual performance review. Joining me today are Bryan Hancock and Bill Schaninger, both leaders in McKinsey’s Organization Practice and coauthors of a recent McKinsey Quarterly article on fairness in performance management. Bryan, Bill, welcome to the podcast.', 'Bryan Hancock: Thank you for having us.', 'Bill Schaninger: Good afternoon.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Let’s start with some straight talk. We all know many people who find at least elements of the performance-management process pretty painful. Many of us have colleagues who suffer from a version of seasonal affective disorder that begins to manifest in the fall and then vanishes magically at the close of ratings season. Where do you see companies going wrong on core processes like feedback and evaluation? Bill, let’s start with you.', 'Bill Schaninger: One of the most interesting things that we turned up when we were looking at a bunch of clients was that many of them said they were stopping. And we said, “OK, well, come on. You have to have some way of keeping score.” But when we really dug at it, we found a couple of basic things.', 'Companies over the last decade and a half have really fixated on tools and processes: the “magic” nine-box [grid], the magic ratings scale, the magic form, or, on the process side, being fixated on the annual process. The part that was missing always was the role of the individual manager. Our joke title for one of our articles was, “Putting the manager back in performance management.”', 'You’ll see a trend in a lot of what we’re talking about in that there is still no substitute for that direct feedback and direct coaching that happens day in and day out, not just annually. We’re going to have a lot of horror stories, I’m sure. But in the places where we find it’s working well, it’s because you’re working for someone who bothers to check in and go, “How’s it going? Have you thought about this? I saw that.” It’s that critical relationship of employee to boss.', 'Bryan Hancock: Our research shows that a vast majority of CEOs actually don’t find the performance-management process all that helpful in identifying who the best performers are. Over half of the individuals surveyed think that their managers didn’t get the performance review right.', 'So, we’ve got a process in which the people receiving the review don’t think they got it right, and the CEOs don’t find it useful. Yet we’re stuck in this annual cycle of going through this, because it’s, in some companies, the only time where they can force managers to give feedback. So, they say it’s worth all the pain to have at least one annual conversation.', 'Lucia Rahilly: This has been going on for decades. Performance management is not a new concept. Why now? Why are companies putting core processes back on the front burner at this particular juncture? And why do we think we can fix it now?', 'Bill Schaninger: There are probably two things coming together at once. One, when you saw a run of clients get rid of the ratings, they ran into the very real problem that, at least in North America and Western Europe, you really do need some form of a documented administrative evaluation of the year to make any employment decisions, or you treat everyone exactly the same. There is just a basic legalese version of “you need something.”', 'When you went and looked at the people who made the big ballyhoo, “Oh, we’re  getting rid of it,” if you scratched even a little, they went to “ghost” ratings. They went to conversations that were a calibration that really was a rating—in the background, that was the administrative function.', 'They recognized they needed something. But they were all saying, “We can’t do what we were doing before.” What that started becoming was purely an administrative outcome. When we ran it back 25 years—that took us back to the mid ’90s—you had reengineering. That was a process orientation of “leaning out.” You had massive budget cuts and real downsizing during the ’90s. Then you had the e-HR era in the late ’90s, early naughts. That was the rise of self-service. Then you saw another round of massive cuts and, increasingly, a move to centers of excellence and distributive things.', 'And so, in general, the people who used to “feed the beast” and/or who had spans of control, like the HR business partner, who were small enough to really provide coaching, were not there. Who did it fall on? It fell on the manager. Then the managers suddenly felt overwhelmed with an increasing level of the bureaucratic nature of the process. And they started mailing it in. That’s the reality.', 'No one was getting anything out of it that they wanted. Most humans like knowing how they’re doing. Could you imagine playing an entire season of soccer, or football, or baseball and never actually knowing the score? I was recently at an eight-year-old’s lacrosse game where they notionally didn’t keep score. You know who was keeping score? The parents, and the kids. Everyone else was keeping score other than them, because we like to know how it’s going.', 'There’s been such a groundswell of people saying, “Don’t make this painful. But if I get something out of it that’s useful, I’m willing to invest in it.” That starts more with the day in and day out and less about the annual (Exhibit 1).', '', 'Bryan Hancock: There’s a structural driver to the changing nature of work that is part of why performance management has become such a hot topic now. As you get more and more jobs that are knowledge based and interdependent, there are fewer jobs where you naturally receive the feedback of whether you did a good job as part of what you’re doing.', 'If you’re a salesperson, and you’re not involved in solution selling, but rather you’re a traditional door-to-door salesperson, whether you sold a product is its own form of feedback. You can go back at the end of the day and recognize, “Am I ‘crushing it’ as a business salesperson or not?” Because you have the objective feedback. Same way if I’m operating a factory, and there are a number of factories in the network making the same product, and I have the lowest productivity. I can look back and say, “I understand how objectively we’re making fewer products, or we have a higher defect rate, or it’s more expensive to operate in my factory.”', 'But when you’re talking about the head of strategy or head of digital design, those are inherently more interdependent roles. They’re roles where the feedback may not come naturally. At the end of the day, you may feel like you’re crushing it, and your boss doesn’t.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Compounding that, I would imagine, is that the labor market has been extremely tight in the knowledge-work fields. It would seem that there might be a correlation between supply and demand in the labor market and the need to give developmental feedback, at least, to employees in order to raise their performance, because you have to compete.', 'Bryan Hancock: There’s one part of it—that the tight labor market makes people afraid to give negative feedback, especially during the year. They don’t want to lose their people. They don’t want to lose this valuable resource. In some cases, it’s not that they’re worried about losing it outside of their companies, they’re worried about losing it from the team. Someone might think, “Oh, that person’s really tough. I’m going to transfer over here.” As a manager, you know you can’t replace that person, so you really soft-pedal the feedback during the year. For you, getting rid of ratings means, “Ha! Another reason why somebody’s not going to get mad at me, not going to leave.”', 'But at the same time, you’re not developing that person. You’re not advancing them. You’re protecting against the downside, but you’re never really seeing the upside of what a good, ongoing performance-management conversation could be.', 'Bill Schaninger: And you’re still missing the opportunity. So much of the conversations we have are organized around an annual process. Most of the annual processes that we have in companies are because of the financial system, driven by accounting rules. They force you to close the books annually. The talent budget is literally an artifact of just getting it in for the financial system. If this was 1950 or 1960, and the annual plan still mattered a lot, and you broadly knew exactly what your job was going to be, and you were going to be doing the same thing every day—because it was “planful,” and you’re going to go, “OK, we draw lines around it”—then, maybe, a static job description and a once-a-year review would be OK, although not likely.', 'But in an environment where, increasingly, your work is chunked into a week, a couple days, a month, and is far more dynamic, with much faster cycle times, with project-based work, different people, different clients, it’s unacceptable. Because that’s, again, like going to a game and thinking, “I don’t know what the score is.” You show up the next day, you’re playing a different game, and you still don’t get a score.', 'That’s the challenge here: as much as we hear about all the digital stuff, all the agile stuff, the common denominators are pace and the deployment and redeployment of people in different combinations. If you have any chance of wanting employees to feel good about what they’re doing, they need the reinforcement in both directions. Most people don’t get up and think, “Yes, I’m just going to assume I’m doing wonderfully.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Bryan, you raised the topic of fairness. Fairness is genuinely a vexed concept. How do you optimize for a metric that is so rooted in subjective experience? In other words, what can you companies do to make their processes fairer?', 'Bryan Hancock: Part of what we found through our research is what drives perceived fairness in the performance-management process (Exhibit 2). One of the drivers of fairness is that you understand how what you’re working on fits in the bigger picture: “I understand how this links into the department or the overall strategy.”', '', 'The second driver of fairness is that there’s an ongoing component. “My manager has an ongoing conversation with me about how I’m doing, so I’m not surprised. I know what I’m working on, how it fits in. My manager has the conversation with me.”', 'The third component of fairness is about differentiated compensations, and, in particular, two kinds of differentiation. One type of differentiated compensation is making sure that the people who are loafing aren’t making the same as what others are making. Because that’s not fair.', 'They’re not pulling their fair share. And the other is that we’re recognizing, and fairly recognizing, those who are disproportionately good performers, recognizing the Steph Curry and Klay Thompson of the team. Yes, they should be making a bit more, and recognizing that raises the perceived fairness for everybody.', 'For companies, when they get those three elements right, it raises the perception of fairness of the overall performance-management process (Exhibit 3).', '', 'Lucia Rahilly: Can one of you give an example of a company that is doing those things well, or at least a couple of those things well? Take, for example, people feeling like their work and their contributions matter and that they align with the business goals. How does that play out in practice?', 'Bill Schaninger: We happen to spend a lot of time studying organizational health. Some of the components of that talk about things like strategic clarity and role clarity. But if you think about that chain, it almost always starts with a few questions like, “What’s the long game for this company, and do I find it meaningful?” Basically, “Do we do something that I think matters?” You go, OK, that’s a great idea. What’s our plan? And the plan ought to be pretty detailed: Here are the milestones. Here are the targets. Here are the goals. I just said “goals” and “targets,” which are part of the annual goal-setting exercise.', 'For you to even have a hint at fairness, you have to start from those two things: “I like our long game. I got our plan. I know what success will be judged by,” and then dot-dot-dot down, “and I know what my part of it is.” It is obvious, classic role clarity, which means, “I know what you’re asking me to do. I know what good looks like, by when it has to be done, with whom I have to work, and what I can decide on my own.” When you have that, they at least feel like they have a fighting chance. That’s almost like the hygiene factor.', 'And then you get into the other thing Bryan was talking about, which is good, old-fashioned managers showing up and coaching: “Hey, try this. Have you thought about that? Oh, that didn’t go well. What do you think about this?” You know that you have a fighting chance, because this doesn’t have to be easy. With increasing pressure for performance, you’d expect that the target-setting part would feel pretty stretchy.', 'We’ve seen organizations do a much better job, particularly in professional services, where you see project-based work, IT shops that have adopted agile ways of working, anyplace where they’ve been allowed to break it down. It’s much easier to draw an immediacy link of the thing you’re doing today and how it impacts the company. It’s also an attack, again, on the long, static job description. It’s too hard to connect to. You’ll see things ebb, and flow, and change. That’s a big part of it—the sense of meaning. It’s been linked to millennials.', 'Millennials get labeled with a lot, like, “Oh, I want my work to be meaningful. Oh, I expect someone to be thinking about my development.” If you were to convert those claims, and what Bryan was talking about as matters to fairness, into plain language: “I’d like to know someone cares about me. I’d like to know the things I’m working on matter. And I’d like to know how it’s going, so I have a chance to be successful.” Well, who wouldn’t want that? It’s no wonder that the data was so obviously one sided, saying if this doesn’t seem fair, it’s not going to yield any performance improvement individually or organizationally.', 'Lucia Rahilly: You’re relating this to millennials. But, in fact, it sounds like what you’re illuminating applies across demographics.', 'Bill Schaninger: Everybody wants it.', 'Lucia Rahilly: And so, what’s different about now? Is it the cadence and the complexity of working on teams, and having priorities change, and nimble decision making, and rapid prototyping, and those kinds of environments?', 'Bill Schaninger: A voice has been given to the millennials because it’s an easy group to talk about. But I think enough work has gotten more broken up into smaller chunks. And there’s just enough noise in the air about it that I think it’s hard for people to ignore it now. It’s almost given a voice to the employees to say, “This has to get better for us too.”', 'Bryan Hancock: As we look at how roles are changing—and there are more roles that are knowledge based, more roles that are interdependent—it becomes more and more incumbent on us to define what we’re working on and why it’s important. It becomes even more important to have the ongoing conversation that then explains the difference in compensation.', 'I really think it’s more interdependency. If you go back to Glengarry Glen Ross, you have the line, “Coffee is for closers.” It’s not like the person turns around and says, “But I’m a closer.” No, he knew where he was on the sales list. He knew he should put that coffee back. He got it. There are so many people today that don’t get it. They’ll hear, “Hey, man, coffee is for closers.” And they’ll think, “Yup, that’s me! I got it.” That’s where the disconnect is, because we’ve become more interdependent. The natural sources of feedback aren’t there. The other things I’d say that have advanced a bit are data and analytics that let you more objectively say whether you’re doing a good job or not. The best example of this is in sports. If you look at the advanced statistics in baseball that can help go into analytics, they can tell where you are in wins above replacement. Now you really understand in an advanced way, “OK, what is it I’m supposed to do? OK, I’m not supposed to steal bases, because stolen bases are actually a negative thing.” I know where I’m supposed to be on the field, because the analytics are telling me. I understand now, in a different way, what I’m supposed to be doing and how it ties to the bigger mission of getting more men on base, not going into an unforced out.', 'Then you’ve got what the manager is supposed to do. If you’re a role player on an NBA team, they tell you what role you’re supposed to play. And then the compensation actually follows this. There are role players now that get paid a lot better and a lot different than role players were paid in the past, because people understand what the value is. And everybody sees that new system is fair. But it required some shifts to get there.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Also, the notion of coaching is a built-in part of the sports function. This is less so in knowledge work, to Bill’s point, in that most managers don’t have the time now to spend, particularly now that there’s been this proliferation of communication channels, and people are slacking, instant messaging, texting, and using internal platforms.', 'So, how has the role of managers changed? Or, how do you propose that it changes to facilitate creating explicit KPIs [key performance indicators] that can be measured for knowledge workers, for example, and then having ongoing conversations with those knowledge workers in a way that’s constructive, doesn’t make people feel put upon, and keeps them motivated?', 'Bill Schaninger: Well, you can’t guarantee the last part. How they feel, whether they feel put upon, you might still get that.', 'You said something very early that teed up something we see all the time, which was that managers “don’t have time.” I think we can all agree, if someone’s doing a piece of work for you, that you checking in with them about making sure they understand what you’re asking, asking how it’s going, and then positively recognizing and rewarding them—I think most people would go, “Oh, yeah, that’s a good idea.”', 'If we agree that, in general, that’s a good idea, but we know it’s not happening, well, then it’s worthwhile asking: Why aren’t otherwise-well-intentioned managers doing what we know is obvious? One thing you hypothesized is, “I don’t ever have time.” But I do think we see a broader range to that. We bundle it into three basic things.', '[The first is,] “I’m not allowed,” which is, “it’s not my job.” And, interestingly enough, in teams that are formed and reformed, or in semimanaged work teams, there may not be role clarity about providing feedback to others. You see this quite a bit in education. Think about the average K–12 [kindergarten to 12th grade] teacher where the teachers are formed in teams. Whether it’s because of union rules or the perceived “that’s not how we do it around here,” you have role history and it would be a normative violation to provide feedback. “It’s not my job” could be because they just don’t think it’s their job, particularly in a professional setting. How many coders are giving each other feedback on their code, even if one is a tool-carrying manager? In knowledge work, you see a lot of managers who still do the profession.', 'The second one you talked about was, “Well, I can’t. I don’t have the time. I don’t have the resources.” Or, “I don’t know how.” Very few people are going to say they don’t know how to give feedback. But some of them actually don’t. That’s why there is some skill training on this—to be behaviorally focused, talk about what you can do, not assume intent. But the time and resources ones are interesting. Because as we have leaned out organizations, we’ve increased spans, we’ve increased complexity, we’ve increased the expectation that you are plugged in always from the moment we give you what used to be a Blackberry, now a phone.', 'There may be many situations where managers feel like they don’t have time. I can think about many client settings where the first thing we did was get a handle on what the daily manager routine was today and then what it should be. You’d have to do things like, “No meetings before lunch, period. You must be at first starts. You must be at the ‘tool talks.’ You must be at the morning briefing. And, by the way, you’re going to go meet them when they come back in, so you can give them feedback.” Sometimes you have to structurally insert being a manager. The manager is saying, “I don’t have time to talk to the people who do the work for me. I do have time to do paperwork, to do email, and go to meetings.” When you say it that way, it is absurd that it’s not happening. But that’s how we’ve filled up their days.', 'The third one gets a little bit more emotional, because you think about some of the more charged things, such as, “You’re messing with my relationships, my standing in the community.” For many people, it is just too charged, because they themselves will probably have been on the wrong end of some tough feedback, and they didn’t like how they felt. They inevitably project that and think, “Oh, that might be really tough, if I’m telling them that didn’t go well.”', 'When, meanwhile, the person on the other end of the conversation would likely just say, “Yeah, that went really badly. How can I do that differently?” [Without that conversation, you instead] have the employee going, “I don’t know where I stand. Why haven’t they said something? Why aren’t they helping me?” And then you have the manager going, “Oh. I don’t want to make him feel bad. It’ll get better tomorrow.” That’s just a vicious cycle. It never gets better.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Do you genuinely believe that employees are that open to feedback? It seems to me a feature of human nature is for people to fixate much more on one small item of negative than on a suite of positive feedback. My husband gives me a lot of compliments. But when he criticizes how I organize the dishwasher, it really sticks in my craw, and that’s what I remember. I have that experience myself delivering feedback all the time—that I give a generally positive review, and it’s the one piece of developmental feedback that people feel anxious about.', 'Bryan Hancock: This gets to part of the skill of giving feedback. There are ways of giving feedback that are strength based, like saying, “Hey, you are really excellent at delivering presentations and organizing your thoughts when you talk in front of folks. What would be great is if that same skill was applied to your written communications so that they literally read like you would be talking, like you’d be giving a speech. So, why don’t you read that out loud when you do it, because that would really pick up on your great speaking capabilities.” And flip to the employee, who is thinking, “OK, I understand two things. One, that I’m a valued human being—that I’m doing things right, that everything isn’t all bad. And, two, that’s practical advice. That’s a better way of getting me to do better than to say, ‘Hey, work on your writing.’ It gives me a way to think about it building on my strengths.” There is a skill of how to do that.', 'You aren’t going to have every conversation in a strengths-based way. But there are skills, even if something went really badly. Just asking the open-ended question, “So, how do you think that went?” For the vast majority of people, they’re going to say, “Uh, that did not go well.” And you can respond, “Yup. Totally agree. Now we got it on the table. What do you think did go well?” And you can ask probing questions.', 'Lucia Rahilly: OK, so, let’s talk about compensation, because that’s a factor that people really care about. In the US in recent years, I think the low-inflation environment has often translated into constrained increases, even for higher-level performers. You guys view compensation, and designing a fair compensation system, as one of the principal elements of a functioning performance-management approach. How do you design a system that doesn’t leave employees simmering with resentment? What are the features that would make that work?', 'Bryan Hancock: Some parts are easy, and some parts are hard. The parts where it’s easy are where it is pretty objective on what you are supposed to do and on whether you hit the goal. In sales, it’s straightforward whether you hit the sales goal and whether you triggered a level of the sales-incentive plan. And it can be pretty graded, so that you know how much additional you would make at each level, and you know whether you hit it. Same thing in an operations context, which can be more straightforward as to whether you hit the goals and what the consequences for that were, as laid out at the beginning.', 'Where it gets more difficult is in the more subjective, knowledge-based world. Here, it is harder to make fine differentiations of compensation in the middle. It is easier to identify, “Hey, this person is a clear outstanding, differential performer at the very top end and should be rewarded more.” But what we show from the research is, rewarding those folks an extra 1 percent compared to the merit increase everybody else gets doesn’t matter at all. It needs to be 15 percent or more for that to really matter, for compensation differentiation to really make a difference on the high end.', 'However, there is a perceived slight if somebody else that you perceive is doing roughly the same as you got an extra 1 percent bump. The person who got the bump is like, “Sure that’s nice,” but it didn’t really do much for them. The other person is pissed. And they’re going to be pissed for a month or for two months. They will really simmer over it, because it is a perceived injustice.', 'There is a wonderful video you can watch on YouTube that is of two capuchin monkeys that can see each other, one of whom is fed a grape to do a simple task, the other is fed a cucumber. The grape is sweeter than the cucumber. It’s preferred. The capuchin monkey that gets the cucumber repeatedly, when he sees his neighbor getting the grape for the exact same thing, goes ballistic. That is, for many people, the compensation system.', 'Our view on compensation design is, for the harder areas, where it’s more subjective, really separate at the ends—the very low performers and the very high performers. Be very aware for the middle of the risk of a long-term, negative result from a fine differentiation in compensation that some people may not perceive as fair.', 'Bill Schaninger: A core finding for us is, differentiation matters. But it’s differentiation in both directions. And it starts at a basic premise of, what do you believe you should be compensated for? If you believe that you should be compensated for turning up each day, that’s a problem. You should be compensated for achieving your goals. There’s a difference.', 'Then we start getting into all things around language. We used to have the annual cost-of-living increase, or allowance. Everyone got that. That was to keep you whole on inflation. Somewhere along the line, we’ve allowed “a merit” to become synonymous of that, where everyone thinks they get a merit. Well, no, it’s not merit. Merit, by definition, ought to be based on performance. Over the years, we’ve allowed our language to undermine differentiation.', 'The work Bryan and some of our other colleagues have led—and I think there’s a real value here—shows there are truly those among us who “walk on water,” and you look at them and go, “Oh, wow. They’re amazing. Yes, they should be paid more than the rest of us.” And then there are others that are just bringing us down, and they’re an irritant. And they should not be paid more. This is where it’s an interesting cultural point for an organization. Let’s say there is an annual bonus. Are you willing to look people in the face and say, “You still have a job. That’s it. You’re not getting the bonus. There’s nothing additional.” And you look at the people who really crushed it and say, “And you’re getting three [times the bonus].”', 'Lucia Rahilly: But play that out over time. Suppose that the manager adopts an assertive talent-management approach and weeds out poor players—suboptimal players—and develops that big pack of “B” players. If you’re embedding a chasm between the compensation of the superstar “A” players and the B players, how then do you account for development among the B players and a movement of the curve to the right?', 'Bill Schaninger: The basic premise here has a few things that none of us like to get our heads around. If you go into a room full of Mensa [Mensa International] members, half that room is below average. That’s the reality. So, we’re moving the mean on any organization up, which is the ideal. Let’s say the distribution even starts moving out, because you have a bunch of people in here who are really good. We’re not saying to spend time differentiating on the heavy 80 percent or the heavy 75 percent—the ones in the middle, who are all probably doing a great job. We’re saying, differentiate the tails. And the reality is, when you’re moving the mean, people who were good enough yesterday will not be good enough tomorrow. That is at the essence of a continuously improving organization.', 'Lucia Rahilly: So, how do you see technology facilitating this kind of process?', 'Bryan Hancock: As organizations get flatter, you more naturally are working with more and more people across such organizations. Having a way of getting and collecting feedback from all the folks that you’re working with, technology can help enable that. Who is best positioned to opine on whether a particular set of code was good? The person compiling it is probably in the best position to say whether that was good, clean, or not. Because once it all starts to work, it’s really hard for a manager, or somebody above, to be able to see that.', 'Technology can be very good in gathering peer-based feedback, feedback outside of the formal hierarchies. In these knowledge roles, it’s harder to determine what good performance looks like because there’s not a built-in performance-management mechanism. It’s not like the salesperson who didn’t make the sale. That ongoing feedback from your peers, in a technology-enabled way, can make that happen.', 'Lucia Rahilly: We’ve heard a lot about gender bias in feedback and different ways that folks offer feedback for women versus for men. How does that factor into this kind of technologically facilitated feedback-on-all-sides approach, if at all?', 'Bill Schaninger: There are gender biases, there are national biases, there are cultural biases. They are all there. One of the beauties of large samples is that you can see thematic trends that can rule some of these things out because it’s over rolling, large numbers. If [feedback is that] someone’s a jerk, if you only have one data point, you have no idea whether that’s the prickliness of the person who’s providing it or actual behavior. But if you roll over these samples, you can see a pattern of varying degrees—of things about how they deliver feedback or how they interact when it comes to taking credit for things. Large samples get a lot.', 'There is also an opportunity here to separate out administrative feedback, which is that which goes into the review, from developmental feedback.', 'It is really interesting that in some of these platforms, whether it’s the apps where people are nudged to give the feedback, if you make it clear that the feedback is developmental, it is much more direct and much more pointed with much less varnish about saying, “You’re doing this. This is working. You’re doing this. This is not.”', 'Lucia Rahilly: Give me your two-sentence summary to a CEO or to a leader who really wants to break through on performance management.', 'Bryan Hancock: Improving performance management is about putting the manager back into performance management and making sure that you’ve got the right ongoing conversations versus having a one-time annual review that may seem disconnected from the employee’s reality.', 'Bill Schaninger: For all CEOs, I’d say, “For everyone else in the organization, you are they. If you want to change the tenor and performance, you have to change the way in which you’re engaging on it.”', 'The beauty of that is, every person who has a relationship where they’re responsible for leading others has an opportunity to do that every day. Don’t make it about the system. Don’t make it about the process. Don’t make it about the tool. Just start with the actual interaction. What are we doing today or this week? How’s it going? What can we do better? Just do that. It gets better.', 'Lucia Rahilly: Great. Bryan Hancock, Bill Schaninger, thanks for talking with us today.

79,Start up & scale up: A conversation with Box CEO Aaron Levie,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/aaron-levie-box-ceo,"The cloud-service cofounder and CEO talks about innovation, disruption, and harnessing the next big thing.","['The cloud-service cofounder and CEO talks about innovation, disruption, and harnessing the next big thing.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, Box CEO Aaron Levie speaks with McKinsey’s Simon London about how his team was able to start up and scale up the cloud-storage company, driving business growth while focusing on continuous innovation, and how artificial intelligence (AI) will factor into the company’s future.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Our guest today is in some ways the archetypal Silicon Valley mogul. Aaron Levie cofounded Box while still an undergraduate and left his studies behind to focus on building the cloud-storage company. He talks fast, favors sneakers over highly polished oxfords, and now leads an organization valued at more than $3 billion. And yet, at college, Aaron was a student of business, not computer science. He’s an avid reader of business books, thinks deeply about strategy and organization, and, as we’ll hear, is interested not only in the future of technology but also in the future of management. So without further ado, fasten your seat belts for this conversation with Box CEO Aaron Levie. Aaron, thanks for doing this.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Thanks for having me. Really exciting.', 'Simon London:\\u2002If you don’t mind, I’m going to ask, for people who might not know the company, just give us the story right from the very beginning. What’s the origin story? And take us through where you are today.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002We started Box in 2005. We were sophomores in college, and we had this idea that it should be really, really easy to be able to share and access files from anywhere. It was a very basic idea. We launched this product. Eventually we got really lucky and got some early venture capital from Mark Cuban. That compelled us to drop out of college.', 'So we dropped out of college. We moved to Silicon Valley. As we thought about what we wanted to build as a company and as we wanted to scale the business, we decided to focus 100 percent on the enterprise market. Since 2007, we’ve been 100 percent focused on helping businesses securely manage, share, collaborate, and organize their critical information in the cloud.', 'We help companies manage everything: their financial documents, their media content, their marketing presentations, collaboration with ad agencies, collaboration with clients. We work with 85,000 customers globally, including about 70 percent of the Fortune 500.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Employees now?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002We have about 1,900 employees.', 'Simon London:\\u2002And revenue this year is?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Last year, we did a little over $500 million in revenue. And this year, we’ve guided to about a little over $600 million in revenue.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Thank you for that. The obvious follow-up question is: Along that journey, what have you learned about scaling a software company? Because that has special characteristics—but then maybe after that, just generalize a little advice to people who are on this journey.', 'You have to be nimble enough, you have to be agile enough, as new information is coming in, to constantly be evolving.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002We’ve certainly learned a whole bunch of things not to do over the years. We’ve made our fair share of mistakes. The thing that has worked incredibly well is having a long-term vision for where you’re going.', 'There are so many things that have the potential to veer you off course. If you are not really, really sure of what you’re trying to do over the long run, like a ten-plus year vision, it is so easy to go off course. We were fortunate. Very early on, we had this vision, which was, we saw  that everybody’s work style was going to be changing in the future. Every company was going to have to change the way they collaborated, the way they shared, the way they fundamentally ran their businesses. That was going to lead people to having to use the cloud to work and manage their data. And we were building an architecture and a strategy and a technology that could lead toward that vision of the future.', 'Simon London:\\u2002And you were not afraid to pivot early on, right? So it’s not like you locked in too early.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002No, we had a lot of flexibility early on. Probably too much. In the first year and a half of the company, I would say every 48 hours we’d change our business model. The way it would work is, we had four founders of the company, including myself, and what would happen was, if you went to bed too early one night, you were at risk of waking up and learning that the business model had changed.', 'There was a lot of early constant iterating, constant pivoting of the business. That became one of our core values as a company. We have seven core values that we really live by. And one of them is take risks, fail fast, and get shit done. The emphasis there being fail fast. The moment that we get information that we feel is going to be critical, we will make decisions rapidly on that. That has been built now into the culture of building an organization where you’re constantly iterating and you’re constantly testing ideas. You have to make sure that they line up against the long-term vision. But you have to be nimble enough, you have to be agile enough, as new information is coming in, to be able to constantly be evolving and veering the company in just slightly new directions.', 'That has stuck with us for a long time. There’s been a lot of near-death decisions and moments as a company where if we had gone a different direction, we’d be in a very different spot. One of those was the fundamental business model of focusing on the enterprise.', 'Simon London:\\u2002It feels like you—very successfully as it turned out—decided to go for growth and to double down on growth. You wrote quite an interesting HBR [Harvard Business Review] piece about returns to scale. Do you just want to talk about that and the moments when you had to decide, “Do we double down on growth? Or do we start running the business for profitability and cash?”', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Tell me if I’m wrong. I think you guys wrote a piece called, “Grow fast or die slow.”', 'Simon London:\\u2002That’s it.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002OK, good. Did I do a good plug just now?', 'Simon London:\\u2002That was perfect.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Great. OK. It’s completely true in the software world where in some cases you have strong network effects. In other cases, the economies of scale you get by building software are obviously massive. There’s a premium—an orders-of-magnitude premium—on the companies that are number one or number two in their market relative to three, four, five, and so on.', 'So that means you really have to make sure you’re building for scale. The moment you believe that your product has product market fit and it’s working for customers, you’re pretty incentivized to growing as quickly as humanly possible [Exhibit 1]. We felt that moment in probably 2009, 2010 where, for the first time ever, large enterprises were saying, “OK, we’re fine with cloud. We think this is a more secure, safer way to do our work.”', '', 'The moment that we started seeing and experiencing that, and we saw that there were a bunch of tail winds that were driving our growth—things like mobile, cloud computing being adopted in the enterprise—we said, “OK, we’re going to now bet the whole business on growing as quickly as possible.” That was when we raised a few hundred million dollars over the subsequent few years because we had to make sure we were building up the technology team, the sales force, the go-to-market engine to reach every customer possible. We knew that this was a market that was going to be defined by the company that could have 90 percent of the large enterprises on the planet using their technology versus if you only had 10 or 15 percent of the enterprises.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Presumably to pursue that strategy, you need to be very aligned with your investors.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Extremely.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Because those are big bets. Did you need to reset with the original investors and say, “OK, maybe you thought you were going to start seeing some cash positive.”', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002I feel bad for our early investors because, I think from 2006 to 2012, I’m almost positive we pitched each subsequent investor on, “This is the round where we get to cash-flow positive.” We genuinely thought that was what was going to happen, and then what would happen is, our growth rate would exceed our expectations.', 'Or you just knew that with one more concentric circle of investment from where we were, we could grow even faster. That led everybody to conclude, including our early investors, that it was time to raise more capital and invest more in growth. Where start-ups get this wrong a lot is the sequence that is so fundamental. You have to make sure the product is working and that the customers want the product. Then you invest. A lot of start-up founders, VCs [venture capitalists], think that somehow you can buy your way to that, and you almost overfund your product development to the point where you might spend $10 million, $20 million, $50 million, $100 million just on building product well before the market actually even is interested in what you’re creating. And that’s where it’s really risky.', 'We were fortunate. We started the company with $15,000. We spent a total of $15,000 and proved that people wanted what we were building. That was in the consumer space. But then it only took a couple million more to prove that enterprises wanted what we had. From that point forward, just scaling. It’s really dangerous to start to prematurely scale using venture capital if you haven’t proved that your product both can scale, but then also the economics of the product actually make sense at scale.', 'Simon London:\\u2002The interesting question is, to what extent is that specific to software, internet, and cloud businesses? It sounds quite dangerous, generalizable advice to a company making and selling shoes.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Oh, totally. The massive caveat should be, only take this advice if you have a recurring-revenue business where each customer you acquire is likely going to be with you for a long time and there are network effects. Certainly, if you’re selling a product on a one-off basis, no amount of scale is going to help if you have bad unit economics. You’re just now going to have bad unit economics at scale. It’s really hard to make a profit if each product that you’re selling is unprofitable, so it is pretty unique to software.', 'Simon London:\\u2002The other thing that strikes me is, there’s a big debate about short term-ism and how providers of capital are too short term. But you didn’t show positive cash flow until how many years after the founding?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002It’s too scary to talk about. But probably about 11 years.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Right. And that’s really interesting.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Our most cash-flow-positive months were month one and month 137 or something.', 'Simon London:\\u2002But that’s really interesting, isn’t it? It shows that there is patient capital out there, but you have to align the investors.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002And it can be very scary at times. Because if you go off course for one or two quarters, then all of a sudden the whole model changes in some fundamental ways. When you’re burning cash, the model is very, very sensitive to what your assumptions are, and the moment those are wrong and either your growth is faster than you expected, so now you need more cash, or the growth is not there, but you spent the money. In both of those scenarios, it’s very dangerous. We have been blessed by a very strong finance and strategy-planning function. Without that, I think we’d be in a very different position.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Right. Can we talk a little bit about technology trends?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002I love those.', 'Simon London:\\u2002You were born on the right side of history with respect to cloud, right?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Yeah.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Then you got on the right side of history with mobile, as I understand it.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Yeah.', 'Simon London:\\u2002That was, you saw that coming, and you moved on it. So what’s coming next, and how do you make sure you’re on the right side of history? What’s the big thing?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002I think today’s version of those is, how are you or how is any company thinking about AI and machine learning? One of the really important things is, it’s not enough to just say, “OK, we’re doing AI” or “We’re doing machine learning.” The dependency of doing AI or machine learning really well is, do you have your data set in a form that you can make use of and make sense of?', 'And a lot of companies are not thinking through their long-term technology strategy to say, “Is my information being managed, stored, organized in a way that I’ll eventually get the kind of accretive benefits of AI on top of this data?” [Exhibit 2].', '', 'Simon London:\\u2002I think it’s what people call data strategy, isn’t it? You’ve got to get your data strategy right before you even really start rolling out.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002That’s exactly right. And you have too many organizations that have fragmented data where you don’t have the connection between different objects and between different data sets. For us, we are benefiting from the architecture decisions we made 13 years ago about being in the cloud. It means we have all the data in one place. I think a lot of customers have to think through, in three, or five, or ten years from now, are you going to be able to leverage best-in-class AI or machine-learning technology? Is your data in a format? Is it stored and managed in a manner that lets you take advantage of that? So that’s a big one.', 'When we think about our overall strategy, some of it is becoming one part technology as it relates to the deep technology architecture and one part more the science of management and how that is changing. The coupling of technology and business culture—and are we setting our product up and are we setting our business up to be at the center of where we see the future of work?', 'That obviously is super important to us because our whole product is 100 percent driven by, can we enable companies to work in a modern way? Which means we have to make sure we understand and we see what that modern way of working is all about. That’s where we spend the majority of our time.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Let’s talk about the future of work, because it’s an interesting topic that has a number of different meanings. A lot of the stuff you see written about the future of work is just how much work there is going to be ten years down. But I’m guessing that’s not really what you’re talking about. You’re talking about how work will get done within enterprises.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002To that point, there’s a future of jobs. So the jobs themselves: What are the job categories? Who is going to do what? Then to us, when we say future of work, we think about, OK, what does work look like? How does work get done inside of an organization? Whether that’s knowledge work or industrial, mechanical work, whatever that work tends to be.', 'We think we’re at this fundamental juncture where the 100-plus years of industrial-age management systems and practices are showing signs of not being able to scale for the digital age and not being able to translate well into the digital age. When you look at the hierarchies of organizations, when you look at the workflow patterns and processes of organizations, the waterfall methodology of product development and decision making, the asynchronous flow of data throughout an organization—all of these things we think are going to be rendered completely useless in the digital age. And not just useless, but in most cases slowing down companies and how they operate.', 'We think that, interestingly, a lot of the lessons to be learned are from software start-ups and the practices that smaller start-ups have had to learn in the software-development practice of being agile, being able to iterate quickly, having a tremendous amount of data to make decisions from, making sure that you have small teams that can move rapidly, being very, very close to the customer [Exhibit 3]. Those practices that were built out for software and for the internet translate now into every part of a business, whether that’s HR, finance, product development, and marketing. That’s the profound change in business, which is taking these agile, team-based practices of building things and now translating and having that manifest into every part of an organization.', '', 'Simon London:\\u2002It’s moving from what I like to think of as agile with a capital “A,” or actual hardcore agile software-development methodology, to agile with a small “a,” or agility.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Yes.', 'Simon London:\\u2002And how do you take some of these practices and that whole ethos and spread it out across a company?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Now, the question is, are large enterprises prepared both culturally and technically to be able to get there? We spend a lot of time with large-enterprise customers that are going through that journey, and they’re kind of saying, “OK, it’s not enough to just have modern technology. I can buy every cool new Silicon Valley software start-up product, but if my culture doesn’t change, I actually can’t get that much use from this technology.”', 'Conversely, you can have the world’s best HR leader and the world’s best CEO driving transformation, but if your technology stacks mean that people can’t share data, they can’t work in real time, they can’t collaborate across the traditional divisions in their organization, then no amount of “cultural change” is going to manifest in real productivity.', 'The thing that we’re seeing, which is a pretty interesting trend, is the complementary transformation that’s being driven from the IT technology organization as well as HR and operations. These things are feeding off of each other in a profound way and that we think are going to collude to then ultimately transform how companies will operate, which is that you have to get to smaller teams that move much more rapidly and that have permission to fail but iterate constantly. They have to have data to get their jobs done. They have to be able to connect up to the rest of the business, so people know what’s going on. That creates an environment of a lot more transparency, a lot more openness, and a lot more inherent accountability, because you can see what’s going on.', 'There are a lot of cultures that are not prepared for that. That’s going to be one of the biggest tests of which companies in the Fortune 500 make it to the digital age, or make it through the digital age, and those that don’t.', 'Simon London:\\u2002How do you think about that in terms of Box’s own operations? Because, increasingly, you are delivering at scale, it has to be an incredibly reliable, secure service. So in many ways, you’ve got that foundation that you need to operate. It means we are totally reliable and secure. But on the other hand, as you say, you’re trying to move fast. You’re trying to iterate. You’re trying to learn quickly in agile-type practices. How do you marry those two things together? Which is the challenge that a lot of big companies face.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002This is absolutely the paradox of the digital age, which is that you have to move insanely quickly to stay competitive. At the same time, there are a lot of business processes that were not built for that kind of speed of iteration: if you’re building a car, if you’re building a jet engine, if you’re delivering a new medical treatment.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Yeah. Is it even desirable?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Right.', 'Simon London:\\u2002I’d rather have my plane made slowly. I don’t want it to fail fast.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002This is definitely the challenge that a lot of organizations face. I think the key is to be very, very clear on which business processes you can afford to have this kind of level of iteration, agility, and fail-fast mentality. We don’t have a take-risks approach in our accounting process. However, we still use a lot of agile practices when we are closing the books.', 'We effectively have scrum team meetings where everybody’s getting together, standing up, talking about what are the latest activities that we have to do. The failing fast is, if something’s off track, we’re going to iterate, and we’re going to know within a day or two of that happening, as opposed to the very typical process, which is, I only find out three weeks later that somebody upstream from this process ended up doing something in a way that had the numbers wrong or created some problem.', 'The idea of agility, and the idea of agile with the capital “A,” is, you get people much closer to the work and much closer to the ultimate customer. They are sharing information on a more frequent basis. They are much more accountable and fully own the problem. That transcends whether you’re building the most trivial software or doing jet-engine design or missile design.', 'Simon London:\\u2002So just get a little more specific, if you don’t mind, about AI, machine learning. There’s a lot of hand waving about it. I know you’ve started to build this into the product and platform already. But what’s it going to allow the product and the platform to do that it doesn’t do today?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Box stores tens of billions of files, hundreds of petabytes of data. Most of that information is relatively unstructured. So you take a Word document, or an image, or a video, and you store it in Box. You share it with somebody. But it’s a relatively closed, contained object that we and you don’t know much about at an abstract level. You can look at your file, but you don’t know the essence of the data.', 'Simon London:\\u2002No, you don’t know what’s in there, apart from the file name.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Exactly.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Usually. It could be anything.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Exactly. And so you have to go and read it manually to know what’s going on inside that piece of content. The power of AI is that you can extract information and data from the content itself. If you take an image that a CPG [consumer packaged goods] company has of a new product, you would be able to extract what the objects are in that image. So what are all the product names? What SKU number is it? And be able to take that information.', 'If you were a bank and you had a customer record or a contract, you’d be able to pull out all of the important data about that contract from that customer. So the power of AI is that you can begin to create structure and context from all of your information. And then the question is, what could you do with that? Can I automate business processes based on different rules? As certain images come into the system, I want to be able to route those images to the right person to approve them or review them.', 'I want to be able to automate an insurance-claims process by taking in all of the video or an image from an insurance adjuster or from the consumer themselves and automate that entire process. Or, going as far into some of the more mission-critical aspects of it, I want to be able to understand how my data’s being shared, because there might be security events that are happening where somebody’s sharing a previously unknown-to-be-confidential document, but with AI, I now know that there’s confidential information inside that document. That person’s sharing it with somebody that they’re not supposed to be. I can now alert the security team or block that off.', 'Simon London:\\u2002So it’s things like optical character recognition, image recognition, basically creating this sort of metadata layer that’s autogenerated. And then, as you say, what can you do with that?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Natural-language processing.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Natural-language processing. And then can you start to trigger automated business processes as the information moves through the system?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002That’s exactly the vision. So take a whole bunch of work flows that were either being done in a highly manual way or never being done at all, because they would be cost prohibitive to do. And begin to take the power of AI, structure your information, and then begin to automate those processes. Again, everything in a healthcare-delivery process to an insurance-claims process to a digital-asset-management-review process for a CPG company, that’s how we are approaching AI.', 'But I think the exciting thing is to start to think through all of the tasks that we spend time on inside of a workplace that you just know a computer could do better. A computer can connect the dots between our collective calendars way faster than we can. A computer can connect the dots between different information systems much faster than we can as we’re searching for data.', 'Why does it takes us hours just to be able to pull up the latest business results when we’re looking for our Q2 [second quarter] business performance? Why can’t I just ask a question to Siri and say, “What was our revenue in Q2?” and it spits out the answer? We know that computers can do these things, there just has never been elegant software to be able to connect it all together and deliver that from a user-experience standpoint.', 'These are the things that we see as being incredibly exciting about where AI is going in the workplace. Then we want to begin to make sure that we can spend our time on the areas that humans are, frankly, way better at than computers and are the more fulfilling parts of our job: the creative tasks, the tasks where we’re collaborating with other people, where we’re creating new products and ideas and not just searching for information or doing things that computers are going to be way better at.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Let’s go back to the question I asked around big technology trends and moments being on the right side of history. Building all of these things into the product: These are your bets to be on the right side of history when it comes to AI, right?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Correct. We feel like the way that we are going to manage, share, and collaborate our information in three, or five, or ten years from now is going to look unbelievably different than how it has in the past. And AI is going to be at the center of that.', 'Simon London:\\u2002The other interesting thing, looking at your AI strategy, is, you’re working with Google. You’re working with IBM. You’re working with Amazon. You’re working with just about everybody, right?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Yeah.', 'Simon London:\\u2002That raises a question about ecosystems, which again is something that you’ve written about. Just talk to me about ecosystem strategy [Exhibit 4].', '', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002This is one of the areas that, especially for a lot of incumbent companies, whether they’re in software or whether they’re not digital, companies are going through this evolution. In a world of platforms, you need to interoperate with other platforms. Furthermore, in a world where we are still relatively early on this journey of digitizing the globe, and all of our businesses, how everything around the world works, we’re in a world of non-zero-sum gains and growth in so many different spaces, which means that you have a lot less time to compete. You have to start to collaborate to go after these markets. And so a lot of incumbents are realizing that the competitors that they once had are now going to be their partners in this new era. Because there’s simply no way for any one company to deliver an innovation to solve all of the world’s problems, because of just how much growth and how much opportunity there is.', 'So our approach to this is no different, which is to say, we are going to be, hopefully, the world’s best product and company at managing, structuring, organizing, and securing information. But it turns out that Google has more engineers than us. And it turns out that they’re going to be spending billions of dollars every year on AI. And IBM is going to be spending billions of dollars every year on AI.', 'Why would we want to be in a world where we are trying to compete with those players and their R&D budgets, in a space where they’re going to do unbelievably well, instead of flipping the model on its head and taking all of the strength of their technologies and letting our customers leverage those capabilities? That’s the architecture that we’ve built.', 'The idea is to take advantage of all the unbelievable innovation happening in AI and to start to incorporate and include that in Box, so that customers can turn on any of those services for all of the data that they have inside their platform. It’s not natural for a lot of organizations to be so open and so dependent on other companies and on an ecosystem for their strategy. For us, we were, as you mentioned earlier, born into this new way.', 'We were born on the right side of this era of ecosystems, and interoperability, and integrations. The kinds of companies, again, whether they’re digital or not digital, that think that they’re going to somehow be able to build all of the technology themselves, they’re going to control all of the architecture themselves, that is a fool’s errand in the digital age. The amount of innovation that is happening from so many companies—if you can’t take advantage of all of that and allow all of that to become a tail wind for your strategy, then you’re just not going to be able to compete with the companies that do take advantage of that. You see some of companies these days that say, “Hey, I really want to move to the cloud, but the best cloud-computing provider might be one of my competitors.” That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t leverage their technology. They’re going to compete with you whether you like it or not.', 'One of the most profound examples of this is Netflix, where they run primarily on Amazon web servers. Amazon is one of their most significant competitors, but that didn’t change the fact that architecturally, Amazon is the better cloud-computing provider. That has no bearing on how they’re going to compete with Amazon, which is on a completely different part of their business.', 'That ability to say, “OK, we’re going to compete in one area; we’re going to complement each other and partner in another area” is what we see as the way organizations are going to have to operate in the digital age, because of how interdependent all of our technologies and all of our products are.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Before we run out of time, I want to talk a little bit about business. I also read somewhere that every year you reread Clayton M. Christensen’s book Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail (Harvard Business Review Press, 1997). Is that true?', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002I don’t know if I’ve kept up with it every year. For the sake of accuracy, I would say it is not true. However, more or less, every couple of years, I reread it as a reminder about, again, how important these moments are when you’re thinking through, is that a competitor that’s coming up behind you, is that an actual disruptive threat, or is more of a sustaining innovation that you’re going to be able to adapt to?', 'Is there something that you’re not responding to in the market because your organization finds it unattractive to respond to that thing? Or are we just not moving fast enough? These are fundamental decisions that teach you when you are at risk of being disrupted. But then, conversely, are there areas where you can be more disruptive to competition? And how do you take advantage of that? That’s why I think it’s always important to be grounded in the core of Innovator’s Dilemma and why it matters.', 'Simon London:\\u2002I think it’s a massively wise book. Over the years, Clay and the book have taken a lot of stick because people throw around “disruption” as a buzzword. But actually, if you really read it, particularly the tensions inside companies, smart people in companies often fail at this.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002I would say 98 percent of the time.', 'Simon London:\\u2002And it’s not because they’re stupid or they didn’t see it coming. It’s all to do with incentives, and processes, and how you navigate it.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002That’s exactly right. It’s funny, because being a digitally born company, you’d think you would know how to avoid this type of issue from happening in your company. But I see it every day, where you can just start to subtly see how one organization’s, or an entire business’s, incentive model is built around something that is now going to leave us in a position to be flanked in one particular area.', 'How do you mitigate that preemptively, before maybe even the competition arrives in terms of attacking you in that area? But it’s all people. It’s all organization. It’s all how people are incentivized. What are people’s goals? The best position to be in is where you’re using Innovator’s Dilemma as an offensive technique to be able to be disruptive in other markets. But at a minimum, understanding it so deeply [helps you understand] why people are not responding to disruptive threats in their organization. And how you make sure that you can avoid that, from a defensive measure, is also equally important.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Well, thank you. This was a wonderfully nerdy, pleasurable conversation.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Thank you. Hopefully we don’t lose too many people in your audience after this one. I don’t want the podcast-subscriber count to drop after this.', 'Simon London:\\u2002No, this is in our sweet spot. This is great stuff.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002OK, cool.', 'Simon London:\\u2002So Aaron Levie, thank you very much.', 'Aaron Levie:\\u2002Thanks a lot.

Today we’re going to be talking about blockchain, the technology that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As we’ll hear, blockchain has a lot of potential applications, in areas as diverse as supply-chain management, trade finance, insurance, and even cybersecurity. But there are a lot of misconceptions and often good reasons why a blockchain may not be the right tool for the job. To help us understand the ins and outs, we’re joined by two McKinsey partners who are working closely with clients on these issues. They are Brant Carson, who’s based in Sydney, and Matt Higginson, who’s based in Boston. Brant and Matt, thanks so much for joining.', 'Brant Carson: You’re welcome.', 'Matt Higginson: You’re very welcome. Happy to be here.', 'Simon London: We should start with a quick level set to make sure everyone—notably me—understands what we’re talking about. Matt, would you mind kicking off by answering the beguilingly simple question, what is blockchain?', 'Matt Higginson: It’s a great question. And there have been many complicated explanations out there. The way I think about blockchain is really to think of it as a database. And it’s a database which is shared across a number of participants. We think about a network of participants. Each has a computer. The idea is that at any moment in time, simultaneously, each member of that network holds an identical copy of the blockchain database on their computer. That’s the essential principle. Information is potentially available to all participants at a moment in time.', 'When I think about that definition as a database, I think of it in three parts. The first is that this is a cryptographically secure database or distributed ledger. That means that when data is read or written from the database, you need the correct cryptographic keys to do that: a public key, which is a basically the address and the database where information is stored, and a private key, which is your personal key, truly the security which prevents other people from updating the information unless they have that correct key. It’s secure data.', 'Second, it’s a digital log or digital database of transactions. Digital’s important because, in many industries, we’re still going through the process of digitization, and that’s an important first step before you can even think about using blockchain.', 'Finally, this is a database that’s shared across either a public or a private network. The most famous public network is probably the Bitcoin blockchain. That is something which has been around for many years. And you can join that network. You can become a node on the network with a computer, without any expressed permissions. And you can leave again. So no one really knows who’s joining and leaving.', 'Conversely, you can have a private blockchain, a private network, which in an application like banking is probably much more culturally acceptable, in which you know who’s participating, who’s got access to data, who’s holding a copy of that database.', 'Simon London: That was very useful. But as a layperson, I’m thinking, well, we already have big databases. And we already have the cloud, where you can share big databases and manage permissions. So just double click for us, why is blockchain potentially a better mousetrap?', 'Matt Higginson: This is the core to answering many questions about why blockchain should be used [see interactive]. Four areas of innovation here.', 'One certainly revolves around the cryptographic keys. The cryptographic security we’re using today that was originated in the Bitcoin blockchain truly comes from 20-plus years of cryptographic research. This wasn’t just invented overnight. The way of securing data in a distributed database through these keys is pretty unique and certainly uses cutting-edge securities. That’s number one.', 'Second, the idea that this is a distributed, a decentralized, database means that you don’t have some of these issues around a database breaking the single point of failure. What you’ve actually got is a system which is very robust. If one database fails, one copy fails, you’ve got that important redundancy across multiple nodes.', 'Third, the essence of blockchain is a chain of blocks of information together. When you have those blocks chained together, you’re creating a perfect audit history. You can go back through time and see a former state of the database. If you’re recording things like property titles, you can see a previous owner of the property and the current owner. You’ve got this perfect audit trail.', 'But perhaps the most important aspect here, and this is what’s getting people excited, is this idea of process integrity. And that is the database can only be updated when two things happen. One, the correct credentials are being applied, the private and public key together. But most importantly, those credentials are being verified by a majority of participants in the network. You can only update the database when the majority of independent computers check and verify those credentials that allow you to write to the database. You’re securing this against the idea of single point of failure and somebody working nefariously to try and corrupt the database. You have this democratization of the process of dating the database.', 'Simon London: Brant, let me bring you in there. If you’re out at a dinner party, and you mention that you work in blockchain, what kind of responses do you get? And what do you hear are the misconceptions about it?', 'Brant Carson: There are a lot of misconceptions [Exhibit 1]. A lot of people have heard of blockchain but really don’t understand quite what it is. You hear everything, from everybody thinking that blockchain is Bitcoin or vice versa through to “it’s a ‘truth’ machine unto itself.”', '', 'Is blockchain Bitcoin? No, as Matt was just saying, Bitcoin is an implementation of and leverages a blockchain in order to deliver a virtual currency. We often hear, “Is it better than traditional databases?” No, it’s not necessarily better than traditional databases. But blockchain is very effective in an environment where you need to have a decentralized way of working or you’re looking to take out a centralized entity—so in things like in trade finances.', 'That said, I mean, blockchain isn’t as efficient as traditional databases. It’s much hungrier in terms of energy use and in many cases has higher storage costs. By definition, it’s much more for specific use cases.', 'Is it immutable or tamper-proof? It is only as immutable and tamper-proof as the implementation itself. And, frankly, if you’re able to take over half the nodes in a blockchain network, it’s very difficult. But if you are, you can tamper with it because then you will be able to affect the consensus algorithm.', 'As far as it being a truth machine, well, the blockchain’s only as good as the information you put in it. So if you have a blockchain, and in the blockchain you’re keeping people’s driver’s license information or voting history, and you put in incorrect data, the data itself isn’t checked in any particular way. All that the blockchain itself does is ensure the integrity of the individuals making the transaction, ensuring that you have the right combination of a public and private key.', 'Matt Higginson: I would just add a couple of thoughts on that. I agree with you entirely, Brant. I think one of the confusions over having a coin like Bitcoin is this idea that there’s inherent monetary value.', 'When we think about the original purpose, it was to reward the computers, the people doing the work, actually doing the verification process. And so a coin was important to provide monetary compensation for, in that case, the electricity being used to do the vast amounts of computation.', 'When we look to implementations of blockchain going forward, very rarely is it necessary to have a coin or some sort of reward. Instead the reward is access to data. If you think about a private blockchain, a closed-loop network of computers, all pursuing the same eventual goal, let’s say it’s in insurance or trade finance, then the reward is being part of that club, that private network. And, frankly, the reward is also being better able to share data and therefore generate better business processes.', 'Simon London: One of the things that strikes me is that a lot of people are drawn to Bitcoin because you’re doing away with the central authority, the central banks in that case. Is disintermediation central to how a blockchain creates value?', 'Brant Carson: Yes, absolutely, disintermediation is one of the ways it creates value, in that you don’t have a central authority. It does make things like trade finance much simpler because you don’t have intermediaries along the way. There’s a very good example: the UN, delivering some of their aid to Syria, has used a blockchain-based solution.', 'And by doing that, they’ve been able to actually authenticate individuals using biometric data and use that as a way to ensure that the aid give is given to the right people and it’s an equitable quantity.', 'This is a very clean way of taking out what would be traditionally money that would follow multiple steps and transaction costs to get to the end users. But there are also many other reasons why blockchain is effective. That is only one of multiple different sources of value.', 'Matt Higginson: I think the principle of disintermediation was a good one, in that the idea of democratization of data, streamlining processes, taking away the central agency power that could actually corrupt how data is being written and recorded permanently. When we looked at the practical applications today, and I’m sure we’ll talk more about that, the real irony in some ways is that in order to justify significant investment in this new technology, you actually need somebody to take a leading role very often.', 'You need someone to stand up and say, “I’m going to be the pioneer. I’m going to develop the platform. And perhaps I’ll bring industry partners in. But I’m doing this potentially because the business case says it gives me competitive advantage.”', 'The irony is, in those use cases where that makes more sense, the developers actually tend to be thinking in a more defensive way: “I already hold a central role in whatever ecosystem I’m playing in, and blockchain presents potentially a better solution.”', 'One example would be somebody who’s certifying the quality of a supply chain. Organic foods, non-GMO foods. In that case you might think of blockchain as providing the source of truth, the real gold-standard details of a supply chain. But the agencies who are developing it still want to hold that central role as being the authority on saying, “Yeah, this food is organic. And we can track it down the supply chain.” It’s a little bit of an irony or a contradiction there. Truly, it’s about disintermediation, but at the same time, those who are investing in the space think of it as a defensive play to strengthen their position in the center of an ecosystem.', 'Simon London: So I would guess you’re both out talking to clients a lot of the time about whether they should invest and how to invest. What are you hearing in terms of how are they thinking about it? How are they thinking about the value equation?', 'Matt Higginson: Frankly, it’s not all the purist view, which is, blockchain is solving industry problems, and this is the new world. There are three camps or categories of ways that companies are thinking about value.', 'One is that purist or academic value, which is, there are intrinsic properties of blockchain, which—this goes to the point about being a better mousetrap—really do solve industry problems. They provide a way of sharing data securely across multiple parties. Things like supply chain or trade finance would be absolutely perfect for that camp.', 'I do think there are a lot of folks who are saying, “Actually, maybe it’s not about the technology. But maybe there’s something around using blockchain as a banner to modernize an industry, to move an industry forward—and also to bring that industry closer together, to collaborate, to solve perennial problems—even if the eventual technology solution is not necessarily blockchain the way we think about, but it is much more around digitization and collaboration.” I think there are a lot of clients thinking in that space.', 'Then I think there’s, cynically, a third group, who are looking at blockchain purely for its reputational value and saying, “I want to prove to shareholders and the rest of the world how innovative we are. I’m going to start a proof of concept [POC] for things like employee rewards points,” a use case that in no way would benefit from blockchain. “We have reward systems that work perfectly well without it. But if I announce I’m doing a POC, I can attract some attention, whether it’s from investigators or shareholders or the like.”', 'When we look at the balance between those three, probably that middle group is the one where we’re seeing the most traction. We’re seeing blockchain as a banner to attract investment, to modernize an industry, agnostic potentially of the end solution, the technology being used.', 'Brant Carson: I agree with that characterization, Matt. And I think that the most important thing for a company to do or executives to do is to just be quite honest with themselves and practical about which of those three buckets their investment is fitting into. I’m not sure they’re quite as clear on where the value is, why precisely they’re doing it, because I do think there are lots of folks who are looking for an interesting press release.', 'Matt Higginson: In the last couple years in certain industries, including the finance industry, there’s a little bit of this disillusionment coming through. We’ve seen lots of investments, to your point, lots of POCs.', 'Yet I would encourage all players in industries who have been doing POCs to take learnings from those initial pilots. There are many industries that are still very manual based, very paper based. Take transaction banking. The cash-management, trade-finance components are still using technologies that, charitably, are 20 years old. There is momentum here. There is investment here to modernize an industry, even if those early POCs don’t appear to have borne fruit yet.', 'Simon London: Surely another issue is that many of those 20-year-old technologies that you mention support quite profitable lines of business for financial institutions.', 'Matt Higginson: They do. It’s a very fair point. The best example I can think of is cross-border payments. Cross-border payments, again, have been using fairly old technology. Up until very recently, you may have taken three to five business days to complete a cross-border payment transaction in certain corridors. You might have paid 2 percent, 3 percent, up to 10 percent in fees and commissions along the way. And, frankly, in the middle of that transaction, for several days, your money disappears. It literally is invisible. For certain big, international money-transfer organizations, this has been a very profitable revenue stream. These are good margins. And these are margins shared out end-to-end across that payments value chain. The promise of same-day, seamless, low-cost, cross-border payments—instantaneous payments using blockchain—is one that truly is disruptive.', 'To be fair to the industry, the major players have looked at this technology, but there’s always going to be a bit of a defensive play. Now, what we’ve actually seen in cross-border payments is that perhaps the dominant messaging player here, SWIFT, has looked at various technologies and has driven modernization using its global payments initiative to improve the customer experience, to get to that same-day experience.', 'That is forcing the industry to modernize. And, naturally, those margins are coming down. So the evolution of this technology is driving improvements. But, certainly, we are still hearing resistance from certain business-unit leaders, as you’d expect, to this new innovation.', 'Simon London: Let’s talk a little bit more about the potential use cases. How do you categorize them? One of the pieces of terminology I came across is static registry versus dynamic registry. Tell us a little bit more about the use cases and, in particular, about static versus dynamic.', 'Brant Carson: When we did our research and looked across industries, we found fundamentally six different categories of business applications [Exhibit 2].', '', 'The first was the static registry, which is a distributed database for storing reference data, things like land title, food safety and origin, information that we don’t expect to change readily. But it gives you a view of the history and also a point of view on ownership.', 'The second is identity. And this is where we think that, with governments in particular, there are a lot of applications around having just a simple distributed database with identity-related information. And this can be everything from voting records to civil registry and identity records.', 'The third would be smart contracts, which I personally find quite interesting. A lot of the clients that I serve are putting real energy into this, where smart contracts are a set of conditions triggering automated, self-executing actions.', 'You could think about things like insurance-claim payouts. Think of having a farmer in a field. They have some IoT [Internet of Things] sensors in the field, and they have an insurance contract that pays out on a monthly basis, depending upon the amount of rain received. Right now in Australia the farmers, in many areas, haven’t had enough rain. If they had insurance contracts, these would simply automatically pay out on the basis of the limited amount of rain that we’ve had in the past month.', 'Dynamic registry, which you’d mentioned, is simply a database that updates as assets are exchanged. This is the example of things like trade finance. These are things that are much higher throughput. The data isn’t very static. It is consistently changing as assets are moving around.', 'Payments is a clear one. Lots of banks are experimenting with this around dynamic, distributed databases for payments of all types, including cryptocurrency. The sixth is technology itself. Everything from ICOs, or initial coin offerings, through to blockchain as a service, where there are many of the big technology players who are developing that as one of their core offerings as an implementation of blockchain.', 'Matt Higginson: A couple things I’d like to add. One is that, broadly, I like this idea of the static versus dynamic registry. Static information, truly information that should not be changed, you need a gold-standard copy of that versus a dynamic registry, which is going to record trade information. Things are getting exchanged, people are owning things at different times. That’s a great categorization, and that helps us think through those use cases.', 'The part of this that sticks in my mind, and when we talk to clients that we have a challenge with, is the information that’s actually being recorded on the blockchain and who’s verifying the information versus the person writing it. Let me give you an example. We talked a little bit about using cryptographic keys to prove your identity, to validate you are who you are and to verify, when you write to the database, that you have the privilege to do that. The blockchain works very well to verify your identity as being the person who has the privilege to write.', 'What it’s not doing is checking the information itself. In Brant’s great example of an insurance contract against drought for farmers, you need a gold-standard source of information, in this case an oracle, a national weather service that provides the information. And those cryptographic keys would identify it as national weather-service information. That feels good.', 'If we think of other applications, things like insurance claims, the challenge there is, it could be the police, it could be a third party, who’s providing the information that says an accident has happened. Well, we can verify the who, who’s writing the information. What we’re going to struggle with is the what. Could it be possible to actually write fraudulent data to blockchain? Of course. You have this off-chain versus on-chain problem, which is, we have no control over the information being written.', 'We just have the control over the author of that information. That leads, and we’ll discuss more about this, but that leads to potential challenges down the line over implementation, which is, maybe this doesn’t prevent that sort of fraud.', 'Simon London: This also true in, say, supply chain, which we mentioned earlier. There’s potentially a very rich set of use cases. If you’re tracking physical goods through a supply chain, sure you can attach RFID tags to them, for example, but that’s off-chain. So I would assume they are as susceptible to tampering as ever they were.', 'Matt Higginson: That’s exactly one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and, frankly, a challenge which has been tackled and hopefully overcome, which is the dematerialization or digitization, the move from physical unique goods to digital unique signatures.', 'It’s one which is typically difficult to overcome. If you’re tracking tomatoes through a blockchain, who’s to say at some point those tomatoes have not been substituted, unless you can uniquely tag them. There have been efforts by various organizations in the industry to develop so-called ledger or blockchain anchors or anchors that are almost at the molecular level that help you uniquely identify things.', 'Of course, in the physical world, if we’re tracking things like aircraft parts, it’s a lot easier to stamp a lump of steel with a unique code that then stays with that item all the way through the supply chain. But when we’re talking about perishable goods or synthetic goods or organic things, I think it does become much more difficult. It’s a great challenge to the industry, and it’s one that’s being tackled; we’re struggling with this transition between physical and digital.', 'There’s another consideration, too, which is, what does blockchain do to a particular market, when you think about using it to identify physical goods? One of the examples that we’ve seen in the industry is, can we actually engrave the private cryptographic key onto precious stones? Or you could also use the same way to identify artwork, adding value then to that precious commodity by giving it a unique identifier. That is terrific for our market because you can say, from its source, we can track this over time.', 'The problem arises when we think about the practicality of implementation, which is, what happens to the rest of the market that doesn’t contain this unique identifier? What happens to the precious stones or the artwork that was created prior to the idea of blockchain? There is the potential to bifurcate, and it certainly would depress the value of those precious stones or artwork and goods that are already in the market. When we think about the applications of blockchain, let’s not only think about the technology component and looking forward but also think about the impact on the legacy industry itself.', 'Simon London: And does this difficult interface between digital and physical explain why there is so much experimentation with blockchain in industry sectors where they’re not facing that? Finance is the obvious example. A lot of what’s being exchanged is already digital.', 'Matt Higginson: That is the area where more progress, of course, has been made. Where you already have assets and instruments which are digitally native, then it makes the whole process of adoption easier but also makes much more sense. And we’ve seen this. We’ve seen POC in things like exchanging of bonds and equities. It actually gets us over that initial hurdle. We are seeing folks already experimenting with having truly digitally native exchanges, offering certain digital products based upon blockchain. The potential here is that this market will accelerate faster. We’re not waiting for this physical-to-digital transition to occur.', 'Brant Carson: I think though that it’s quite interesting, if you look at areas like the public sector. Because in the public sector, in many cases you have relatively static information. You have land-title registry. You have voting records. You have identification. You have travel records, tax records, things that are not actually accumulating that rapidly, but the more that they could be available in a consistent way, it would actually make the operation of government a lot simpler, between departments, if they could be done in a way that people could get comfortable that were quite secure.', 'In healthcare, again, where a lot of the assets, certainly things like imaging, patient records, they’re all electronic. That’s another area where there’s a lot of opportunity to, again, make these things available, particularly if you go to different hospitals, their information systems don’t necessarily easily connect. But if you had a more open blockchain, where you were able to store this information, it would create much easier integration between different hospitals and healthcare systems.', 'Matt Higginson: Brant, that triggers a thought in my mind, too, which is, again, related to lessons learned over the last few years in this space. And that is, it’s very important that when we think about use cases for a particular industry, that we do start with a problem, not with blockchain as a solution.', 'There was a great excitement because of the association of coin with Bitcoin about the use in payments. But I would argue that if you look at domestic payments systems today in many parts of the world, the friction, the pain, of doing domestic payments has already been taken away. It has already been solved. Things like Venmo and Xoom and various digital money-transfer operation solutions—there are many, many in the marketplace—have  already been in existence prior to blockchain and don’t rely on blockchain. Equally, even in government, we are seeing a lot of talk about putting citizen data onto a blockchain. But where adoption or where the implementation is happening fastest is in countries with a very strong central government who, frankly, are able to control the data.', 'Brant Carson: I think that’s a great point, Matt. To build on that further, if you think about the players and who’s in the best position to be able to foster or further the adoption of blockchain, they are actually some of the more dominant players. Governments, because they can essentially mandate it or not, are a good example of that.', 'But, similarly, corporations that are in more highly concentrated industries, where there is much more market dominance, are the ones that are more able to drive the level of standardization required. You can think of things like stock exchanges, where that is much more the case. In places like financial services, where you have lots of banks, what the banks are having to do is, they’re having to create consortia as a way to drive consistency of standard because there are so many global banks that no one individual bank can create a standard unto themselves. In terms of where we’re going to be able to drive adoption and drive adoption faster, it is in places where there is one or more players who are able to work together to drive a standard, such that the vast majority of transactions can leverage that standard.', 'Matt Higginson: It’s funny, we often get asked, to paraphrase, “What’s the right path to adoption?” Easy. You’ve got to have an authoritarian government, which can drive adoption because that’s a good thing for the citizens—or at least the government presents it that way. Or you have a very dominant industry player who essentially has a majority say as to how technology gets adopted. Or—and I think this is the most exciting one—there is a compelling business case to truly modernize an industry. Trade finance is an example. Either one of those three will drive adoption. Without them, I think you’re going to struggle to see a use case really get to full adoption.', 'Simon London: And, again, we go back to this point: the disintermediation of a central authority is not always, or maybe not even in the majority of use cases, what’s creating the value.', 'Matt Higginson: You’re right. But I want to make one more comment on that, which is this piece, again, around business case. In our conversations with clients across so many different industries, the biggest hurdle, if you like, within the industry is, “Do we have a compelling business case? Is there financial value? Is there a good return on investment, investing in a technology which is still, to be fair, nascent?”', 'You may not need disintermediation. You may not even need true democratization of data. But if we’re going to invest in this technology and push it forward, it does have to have an imminent return. And in a world in which a shareholder’s patience is relatively short, and we often work in 12-, 18-, 24-month time scales, it can be hard to prove that business case. And I think that’s been a real struggle in the adoption of blockchain for various use cases and, in some ways, may explain what appears to be a slightly slower adoption curve than perhaps we originally hoped for.', 'Simon London: When you look at this, Brant, what are the other hurdles to adoption that you see out there?', 'Brant Carson: There are technical hurdles to be overcome in just how the implementation is done. That is getting increasingly easier as multiple players are creating much more standardized implementation of blockchain. I think that, much like with storing information in the cloud, there’s still uncertainty about blockchains. And there’s a bit of discomfort from a kind of public population and use of blockchain that has to be overcome, which is always a bit of a hurdle.', 'Then I think there’s a hurdle from a regulatory perspective. As we talked about earlier, you either have to be able to have a regulatory mandate, be a more dominant player, or there has to be a really compelling industry-wide business case. Blockchain is something that certainly benefits quite a bit from either regulatory barriers being raised or taken down.', 'Simon London: What about resource consumption? You mentioned earlier that blockchain can be quite computationally intensive. And it can also be quite energy intensive because you have all these nodes on the network replicating the ledger and doing the cryptographic handshakes and so on. Is this something that’s endemic to blockchain? Or is it really a function of the design choices that you make?', 'Matt Higginson: There is no doubt that having multiple copies of anything is inefficient. I think it is worth drawing this contrast that Bitcoin was set up to be energy intensive as a hurdle to entry. The amount of computation you need to do was set to be high, truly as a barrier to entry, to manage the number of nodes that are doing the computing work.', 'One other consideration that’s important here though is that almost aside from the inefficiency, there are also limitations under today’s implementations about the amount of data that can be stored. Brant, your great example of looking at healthcare records. There is no implementation today that would say you’d put the actual healthcare records themselves onto a distributed ledger. Instead you use it as an index, as metadata for locating your own healthcare records.', 'So on today’s implementations, there are still many limitations. Are we seeing evolutions? Absolutely. And I would argue that the blockchain protocols that we are seeing and reading about today almost certainly are not going to be the ones we’re going to talk about in two or three years’ time. This is a technology which is evolving rapidly. And, in fact, many flavors of these protocols are evolving specifically for specific purposes.', 'Brant Carson: Matt, your answer, I think, was excellent. Because it is true that the Bitcoin implementation of blockchain was very much intended to use as much energy because it was supposed to be a barrier to entry. And there are many different implementations being created and also different consensus algorithms that are being experimented with in order to “solve” the hurdle of energy usage as well as transaction time to reduce the amount of time to complete a transaction. Because right now to complete a Bitcoin transaction, most people don’t realize, it actually takes minutes to complete a Bitcoin transaction, where a transaction on a typical database takes fractions of a second.', 'Simon London: Well, I’m afraid that’s all we have time for today. But thank you very much, Matt Higginson in Boston and Brant Carson in Sydney, for a fascinating discussion.', 'Brant Carson: You’re more than welcome.', 'Matt Higginson: My pleasure.', 'Simon London: And thanks as always to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

81,How secure is the global financial system a decade after the crisis?,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-secure-is-the-global-financial-system-a-decade-after-the-crisis,Great strides have been made since 2008 to prevent a recurrence of the financial crisis and recession that followed. Yet there is more debt than ever in the global financial system.,"['Great strides have been made since 2008 to prevent a recurrence of the financial crisis and recession that followed. Yet there is more debt than ever in the global financial system.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, recorded in August 2018, Simon London speaks with McKinsey Global Institute partner Susan Lund about the global financial system ten years after the crisis that left the world reeling—detailing the state of the world economy and analyzing the potential for such a crisis to repeat itself.', 'Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. Today we’re going to be taking stock of the global financial system ten years on from the tumultuous events of September 2008 and the financial crisis that followed. As we’ll hear, a lot has changed in the decade since the crisis. But is the global financial system actually more secure? Could history repeat itself? And where might we look for the seeds of the next crisis? To answer these questions, today’s guest is Susan Lund. Susan is a McKinsey partner and also an economist with the McKinsey Global Institute. She’s based in Washington, DC. Susan is a coauthor of a new discussion paper on the topics we’ll be discussing today. If you want more detail, facts, figures, and so on, go to McKinsey.com and download it there. So, Susan, thanks so much for joining today.', 'Susan Lund: Thank you.', 'Simon London: I think we should start with a little bit of history, if you don’t mind, Susan. What were the origins of the financial crisis? Where was the epicenter, and how did it happen?', 'Susan Lund: The epicenter of the global financial crisis was really the housing market. It started in the United States, but it turned out that similar housing bubbles were building in other countries, like the UK, Spain, and Ireland. Households were borrowing more than they could afford. Banks were giving out loans at very low interest rates and increasingly having enticing features like interest rates that were very low but then ballooned after a year or two.', 'This meant that households could borrow more than they could really afford to borrow and buy a bigger house. At the same time, all of this was fueling housing-price increases. Banks looked at the credit risk and thought, well it’s fine. These houses are worth a lot, so they have an asset.', 'But the problem started when housing prices stopped growing and instead started declining. And suddenly a lot of households found that they had a lot of debt. Sometimes more than the value of the house. Then the economy fell into a recession and people lost their jobs, so they couldn’t afford these very large mortgages. Now, that in and of itself would’ve been painful. But what made the 2008 financial crisis so globally devastating was that it turns out there were a lot of complex, opaque derivative securities that had been built on top of these underlying mortgage assets.', 'So the subprime mortgage market in the US was pretty small. It was not more than maybe 10 percent of all US mortgages. Yet banks had taken these mortgages, pulled them together, and created something called asset-backed securities. Then they took those and pooled them together again. And so they built trillions and trillions of dollars of financial instruments whose value was riding on those mortgages being repaid.', 'When a few households started defaulting on mortgages, the pain went far beyond those households and the banks that originated them to all these investors around the world. And those global, systemic links weren’t apparent until the crisis hit and we saw banks and investors around the world start getting hit with losses.', 'Simon London: So the obvious question for a microeconomist would be, where were the regulators in all of this?', 'Susan Lund: Well regulators were there, but banks were creating new types of financial instruments. They were gaining popularity; these so-called collateralized debt obligations hadn’t really been seen before. And credit default swaps.', 'These derivatives are great in theory, and they’re often great in practice. But what was happening was, they were creating these systemic risks that the world hadn’t seen before. As it started to unravel, we found out that those risks, rather than being diversified and spread around the world, were concentrated in some very large banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.', 'At the same time, I have to say, banks had very little capital. They were in a position—and they were following global regulations at the time—but they didn’t have a lot of equity capital to withstand large amounts of losses on their balance sheets. When large numbers of mortgages started to go into default, they were facing losses that pushed them into a solvency crisis. That, too, is something that’s changed over the past ten years.', 'Simon London: With the benefit of hindsight, you could say we started with a housing-market bubble, and that’s bad. That’s happened before. But what made this different is that there was a lot of financial innovation that had run ahead of regulation, and to some extent had run ahead of the banks’ ability to manage the risks, plus there just wasn’t enough capital. The shock absorbers weren’t there in the global financial system.', 'Susan Lund: Absolutely. That is a great summary.', 'Simon London: From a macro point of view, something that was discussed a lot of the time was the whole question of global financial imbalances. Again, with the benefit of hindsight, what’s going on?', 'Susan Lund: Global financial imbalances refer to the fact that some countries save a lot and invest less, and other countries invest a lot and save very little. The US is an example of a country that was investing a lot in real estate, but its own savings rate was actually going down, down, down. To finance a lot of the investment that was occurring, foreigners were putting money into the US market. Ben Bernanke coined a term, the “global savings glut.” He was referring to the fact that China and some other Asian countries had very, very high savings rates.', 'One of the things they did with all this surplus savings was channel it into the US treasury market. That’s because the US treasury market is the largest, most liquid, safe asset in the world. That had the effect of pushing down US interest rates.', 'While the housing crisis was building up, you saw very large inflows of foreign money into the US. Often it started in the treasury market, but then that pushed down interest rates. Liquidity worked its way through the system and financed, to some extent, this housing bubble. In that sense, I think that surplus global liquidity, combined with an interconnected global financial system, did play a role in setting the conditions for this massive housing bubble.', 'Simon London: The big question then is, from a layperson’s perspective, could it happen again? Could we get a repeat of the same pattern of a real-estate bubble fueling a banking crisis and that spreading across the world?', 'Susan Lund: History shows us that real-estate bubbles and banking crises go hand in hand and have plagued countries throughout history. So I would never say that it couldn’t happen again. But a lot has changed over the past ten years. First, you see that the households that had borrowed too much prior to the crisis, like households in the US, Ireland, Spain, and the UK, have really cut down on debt a lot.', 'That said, one of the most surprising things over the last ten years is that the total amount of debt in the world has continued to grow. Global debt over the last ten years went from roughly twice the size of global GDP to—today, it’s about 2.4 times global GDP. In absolute terms, the world has $72 trillion more debt than there was back in 2007, on the eve of the crisis. Government debt has grown very rapidly in advanced economies [Exhibit 1]. Globally, government debt has more than doubled. There’s now $60 trillion owed by governments around the world. A lot of this came from advanced economies. The combination of a recession that reduced tax revenues and increased social-welfare payments for unemployment really put a big dent in government fiscal balances.', '', 'And around the world, governments, to one extent or another, provided financial support to the banking system and other critical industries. All of that has made governments more indebted than ever before.', 'But at the same time, companies have borrowed almost as much in addition as governments have. Globally, nonfinancial corporate debt has grown to be even larger than sovereign debt, to $66 trillion. About two-thirds of the growth from that comes from developing countries. And here China stands out in particular. Chinese companies alone have added $15 trillion of debt over the last ten years. This means that the country now has one of the highest corporate debt ratios in the world. But China’s not alone. There are other pockets of corporate borrowing, ranging from Turkey to Chile to Vietnam.', 'It’s a particular problem in these developing countries. I want to know when the debt is in US dollars, or euros, or other foreign currencies, because it means that these companies face a risk. If their own domestic currency, such as the Turkish lira today, depreciates, it means that repaying that foreign currency debt is much more expensive. And the likelihood of default goes way up.', 'Simon London: Tell us a little more about household borrowing. US households have taken on this mortgage debt. We’ve seen similar patterns in the other countries that were at the epicenter of the 2008 crisis. What is the pattern of household borrowing globally? Is there less household debt than there used to be? Or is there also more?', 'Susan Lund: Globally, household debt has also continued to grow since 2007 [Exhibit 2]. But the picture really varies by country, and it’s grown a lot less than corporate debt or government debt. Households in what I think of as the core crisis countries of the US, UK, Spain, and Ireland have all reduced household debt quite significantly.', '', 'But the same pattern hasn’t held in other countries that weren’t as heavily affected. So, for instance, households in Canada have seen household debt continue to grow, and real-estate prices have continued to rise quite rapidly. Today, household Canadian debt is much higher than it was in the US at the peak.', 'Switzerland has very high household debt, as does South Korea. Australia has an extraordinarily high household-debt level. There are also some developing countries where households have borrowed quite a lot over the past ten years. This would include Thailand and Malaysia. In China today, the household debt, when measured against household income—not GDP but household income—is actually similar to the US level today.', 'It’s possible for there to be future crises or banking problems involving mortgage debt and household debt. Even though the US mortgage picture looks good, it’s very clear that ten years on, US households and individuals are still struggling. And many are not financially well.', 'So in the US you see that student debt to fund postsecondary education has exploded. And it’s now at about $1.5 trillion outstanding. That’s even more than credit-card debt in the US. That’s quite worrisome for the future, because student loans cannot be defaulted on. You’re seeing young people with large student-loan burdens not purchasing houses and not purchasing cars—delaying big expenditures. That has a significant impact on overall economic growth.', 'At the same time, there are other metrics. Like a significant share of US households don’t have enough savings to pay for even an unexpected expense of $400 in any given month. They would need to borrow money to do so.', 'Simon London: I think that the point that you make about the US underlines for me that a lot of pain was taken by households—not only in the US but also in a lot of countries—in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In a lot of countries, it’s still being worked through, right?', 'Susan Lund: Absolutely right, Simon. When you look at Greece, for example, today, as we record this, is the day that Greece is formally out of its bailout package financially. But Greek households have been left a lot poorer. Average wages in Greece are down by about 20 percent. Unemployment remains high. Taxes have gone way up.', 'There’s still the sense that even while the economy recovers, households are much poorer. The same would be true in Spain, where the economy has grown quite strongly, but real wages have gone down quite substantially. And youth unemployment in particular remains high. In some sense, with this global financial crisis, even as we’re on the tenth anniversary and we look at all the ways that the financial system is more stable, it’s important to remember that the individual losses and consequences of this crisis have still not been worked through.', 'Simon London: We’ve talked a lot so far about the borrowers. But who’s doing the lending? And is the global banking system more secure, more stable than it was going into the crisis?', 'Susan Lund: There are two parts to the answer to that. Banks are definitely more stable and secure. For one thing, they now hold a lot more capital. For US and European banks, the average Tier 1 capital ratio has risen from about 4 percent of their assets before the crisis to 15 percent today. And the biggest systemically important financial institutions actually hold even more capital than that.', 'In addition, banks have been subject to a whole host of different new regulations, and they have reduced the risk on their balance sheets, and off their balance sheets, in terms of the assets that they hold and the activities, like proprietary trading, that they engage in. At the same time, though, you see that banks are doing a lot less cross-border lending.', 'Overall, one of the things that’s been most notable in the past ten years is that the global financial system is somewhat less interconnected than it was. When you look at the average just in the amounts of money crossing borders, it has shrunk by about half since 2007. Banks are the biggest part of this shrinking. They have sold foreign assets; they’ve exited doing business in some other foreign markets.', 'This has been seen very clearly in Europe but is also true, to some extent, of the largest US banks. For instance, before the crisis, two-thirds of the assets of German banks would’ve been outside of Germany. And today, now, that’s been cut by half. So about a third of German banking assets are outside of Germany. That gives you some sense of this massive restructuring of how banks are doing business. But at the same time that they’ve become more capitalized with less trading risk, one of the things we’ve seen is that they’re not terribly profitable. The banking industry had very high returns up until the global financial crisis. And metrics like return on equity have been cut by more than half.', 'Many banks are not even earning their cost of capital. When you look at their growth prospects, investors are taking a pretty dim view on how fast these institutions will be able to grow. A common metric is the price-to-book ratio [Exhibit 3]. And for a large number of banks in Europe and Japan, this ratio is less than one. Meaning investors are valuing the bank at less than the book value if they just sold off all their assets today.', '', 'Banks are continuing to try to find a way to be profitable in this new environment with more capital and more liquid assets. That’s obviously a problem for banks and their shareholders, but it’s also a systemic problem for all of us because one of the temptations might be to start to engage in riskier-but-higher-return type of activities that led to the crisis ten years ago.', 'Simon London: Another development since the financial crisis—and this one is very close to my heart, because what you don’t know is that my very first job was writing about the Eurobond market—is that the corporate bond market has tripled in size since the global financial crisis.', 'Susan Lund: That’s right. Over the last ten years, as banks have sought to repair their balance sheets after sustaining huge losses, they’ve really retrenched from lending, especially to corporations. And companies, at least the largest companies, have instead turned to corporate bond markets. Prior to the crisis, the US had a very large and liquid corporate bond market. The same could be said of maybe the UK and South Korea. But in Europe, in Japan, and really the rest of the world, companies turned to the largest banks for commercial loans.', 'Over the past ten years, as global banks have retrenched, companies have in fact turned to bond markets outside the United States. You’ve seen a tripling in the size of corporate bonds outstanding [Exhibit 4]. And this is a good thing in terms of systemic risk, because it means that companies are diversifying their sources of financing, and we think that there’s lots more room for sustainable growth.', '', 'Simon London: What about the financial imbalances? The global savings glut and all that? We talked about it ten years ago. Have those things resolved themselves? Or are there still stresses and strains?', 'Susan Lund: Yes. A lot of the global financial imbalances have in fact subsided. So that’s been another very positive development over the past ten years. On the eve of the crisis, China had the world’s largest current account surplus, meaning it was giving its savings to the world. And it was worth nearly 10 percent of GDP in 2007. That’s down to just roughly 1.5 percent of GDP most recently. Then on the borrower side, the US was the world’s largest borrower, receiving capital flows. And its current-account deficit was nearly 6 percent of GDP. That’s now down to about 2.5 percent of GDP. These imbalances have subsided to a large extent.', 'Now, that’s not to say that some countries aren’t running large current-account deficits or surpluses. Germany has been called out by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and others for now maintaining a very large current-account surplus throughout the crisis. Then there are some emerging markets that remain on the deficit side, for instance, like Turkey and Argentina, that could make them vulnerable. As we said earlier, I would never say never. But a lot of the potential risk in global imbalances does seem to have subsided.', 'Simon London: This all sounds very positive. The big, global financial imbalances have largely resolved themselves. Banks are better capitalized. Corporate bond markets have grown up. All sounds very good. Is there anything that we should worry about?', 'Susan Lund: One thing that we know is that the next crisis probably won’t be the same as the last crisis. We’ve done very well in responding to the last crisis, and battening down the hatch, and creating a stronger financial system to guard against those risks.', 'It’s hard to foresee what the next crisis might be. But there are a couple things I think are worth looking at. First would be corporate debt, especially in emerging markets. This would be both loans and bonds. This is particularly true for foreign-currency-denominated loans, which are now in the trillions of dollars of worth. As the US dollar strengthens, as interest rates rise, and if countries come under fire like Turkey is as we record this, a lot of those debts could be unsustainable.', 'Second, I would continue to monitor the global landscape for real-estate bubbles and mortgage risk. Canada, Australia, South Korea, Thailand—there are a whole host of countries, and I would put China in this bucket, that have had continued growth in housing prices, continued growth in household borrowing through mortgages. So that’s a potential risk. In the US, now roughly half of all new mortgages are coming from nonbank lenders. It’s not the same shadow-banking entities that we saw before the crisis, but it still bears watching.', 'Then the third big potential area of risk, I would have to say, would be China’s rapid growth and debt. Over the past ten years, China’s debt, in absolute terms, has more than quadrupled in size. They’ve added more than $21 trillion of debt.', 'They went from basically being on par with other developing countries for their level of debt to now being at, or higher than, the level of economies like the US, Canada, and Germany. One thing we know from financial crises around the world is that whenever you see rapid growth in credit, there’s a high likelihood that lending standards have fallen and that credit underwriting is not as strict as it should’ve been.', 'And so there is a potential risk in China’s debt. A lot of it is related to real estate. If the real-estate market were to go into reverse, that could produce defaults. There have also been a lot of local-government entities that have borrowed to fund low-return-infrastructure and social-housing projects. That’s another potential risk.', 'I would not say that any of these risks are as globally, systemically important as what we saw with the situation before the 2008 financial crisis. Even in China, where they’ve added a lot of debt, most of it has been lent by Chinese lenders, so you don’t see the international linkages in any crisis there. And the Chinese government has plenty of capacity to bail out the financial system, because its central government debt is quite low.', 'Simon London: What about financial innovation? We hear a lot about fintech. And then, of course, there are cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, and all the rest of it. So financial innovation clearly played something of a role in the emergence of the 2008 crisis. Are there things out there that we should worry about?', 'Susan Lund: It’s a very interesting point that, yes, financial innovation, in some sense, was at the heart of the last crisis and created the globally systemic risks that we saw. And it’s unknowable today how some of the new innovations in financial technology would play out.', 'For instance, cryptocurrencies. We could clearly see that in some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, there may be a bit of an asset bubble that could create volatility. But there are real questions about how central-bank monetary policy plays out in a world with digital currencies. And is it less effective than it used to be?', 'There are also market risks coming from high-speed algorithmic trading. We’ve seen some stock-market flash crashes and bond-market and currency flash crashes as computer-generated trading very quickly makes a turn and creates incredible market volatility. We also are starting to see the rise of new technologies, like blockchain, that would enable potentially huge efficiencies in financial transactions but that also are decentralized.', 'One area to watch as we go forward is how the move toward a world of digital finance, digital payments, and robotic artificial-intelligence-driven trading and financial markets—how those impact market dynamics. And the ability of policy makers and central banks to be effective as they set monetary policy.', 'Simon London: Yes. I guess all of that falls into the bucket of known unknowns, doesn’t it? We know that it’s out there, but it’s pretty hard to judge at this point what the impacts are going to be. Another one that falls into that bucket is also good old geopolitics. Whether it’s armed conflict or trade wars.', 'Susan Lund: That’s right. In recent McKinsey Quarterly surveys of executives around the world, one of the notable things over the last few years has been the consistency at which business leaders put geopolitical risk as higher than it’s ever been. There’s just a lot of uncertainty in different regions of the world about political and military conflicts, potentially.', 'Now there’s also uncertainty about the global trading system and whether the 30 years of an increasingly liberalized “free global trading system” is going to be significantly changed and curtailed going forward. All of that could affect financial markets as it affects real economy flows, and production, and investment in ways that are very hard for us to foresee right now.', 'Simon London: We’re out of time for today, but, Susan Lund, thanks so much for joining.', 'Susan Lund: Thank you.

Today, we’re going to be taking the pulse of private markets—that is, the world of private equity and private debt. For the last few years, private equity companies, or general partners as they’re known in the trade, have been riding on a wave of enthusiasm. As big investors, the so-called limited partners have allocated an increasing percentage of their portfolios to private assets. Scratch the surface, and the picture is a little more complex. The flow of money into private markets has slowed somewhat in 2018. Deal activity has also slowed, a sign that general partners are having more difficulty finding companies to buy at prices that make financial sense. The big limited partners, meanwhile, are starting to push for special treatment in the form of joint ventures or separately managed accounts as opposed to investing alongside their peers in so-called comingled funds. Our guides today into the world of private markets are McKinsey partners Bryce Klempner and Matt Portner. Asking the questions is my McKinsey Publishing colleague Cait Murphy. With the scene set, it’s over to Cait.', 'Cait Murphy: Matt, let’s start by talking about capital flows in the PE [private equity] industry. What are the most important trends in terms of how much money is being raised and where?', 'Matt Portner: Last year was a record year for fundraising in private markets overall. What’s interesting is where that growth came from specifically. So, $750 billion globally was raised in private markets. The interesting trends are PE and private debt saw very healthy growth—11 percent and 10 percent, respectively. What’s most interesting is where that growth came from in PE. It was driven heavily by what we call megafunds, which would be those over $5 billion.', 'Bryce Klempner: It’s worth noting that all the growth in 2017 came from a subsegment of a subsegment. If you look at US-based PE megafirms raising buyout funds, their growth accounted for all of the growth in overall private markets fundraising and then some [Exhibit 1]. Absent those, the market was slightly down.', '', 'As you look at 2018, the number of funds raised thus far is down about 40 percent, while aggregate capital raised within PE is down about 30 percent so far. Only time will tell how this plays out over the remainder of the year, but you do see a leveling off of the heady growth that characterized 2017.', 'The industry has had quite an exciting run. The amount of capital that has been coming in has broken records. Maybe some limited partners allocating capital to the asset class have eased off the gas just a little, but we don’t see that as particularly problematic. If you look at the operating metrics for the industry overall, such as the amount of dry powder relative to the amount of deals getting done, it’s been stable over time.', 'Cait Murphy: Let’s talk about investors for a moment, since you raised the topic. What are major investors doing in terms of investing capital in PE?', 'Matt Portner: You’re seeing increased interest across the board, but there are some slight nuances by type of investor. The endowments have been fans of the private markets for quite a long time. Pension funds are increasing their allocations to the asset class consistently. And I think sovereign wealth funds are the big new players, not only in terms of amount of capital they’re allocating, but also in the way they’re playing in the asset class—so, increasingly looking at coinvestment and direct investment as a way to play and not just in comingled funds.', 'Bryce Klempner: It’s also worth noting that family offices and other types of investing institutions that move closer to the retail market have been both putting more capital in the asset class and finding it overall easier to access the asset class, as for a long time general partners have been seeking ways to tap that pool of capital.', 'None of the general partners have quite figured out how to access the retail markets, per se. The products that have started to proliferate there and that are being pushed through the channel of traditional asset-management firms tend to come with fairly high fee burdens.', 'As a result, none of these products has truly blossomed yet, but the move is very clearly in that direction. There is clearly a desire on the part of some of the general partners to figure out ways to democratize access to the asset class, which has historically been the realm only of larger institutions. And it is something that we think will continue to evolve in coming years.', 'Cait Murphy: In 2017, deal volume grew but the actual number of deals completed fell for the second year in a row [Exhibit 2]. Can you please explain what’s going on?', '', 'Bryce Klempner: At the simplest level, there are two major factors driving that. One is simply that multiples are up. So, the multiple of EBITDA required to buy a company has continued to rise. Since those are up and since there’s a finite amount of money chasing deals, mathematically it’s not surprising that as the price goes up, the volume will go down.', 'Looking at it from a different perspective, you could argue that it’s also about the fact that there is a finite supply of companies out there that can be bought by PE at a given expected return.', 'Matt Portner: To build on Bryce’s point, what’s interesting to note last year is that the average deal size grew from $126 million in 2016 to $157 million in 2017, which is a 25 percent increase. But what’s really interesting about that is that two-thirds of that increase is driven by multiples. It’s not simply a matter of finding companies with higher EBITDA or higher growth. It’s really, really multiples driven. To Bryce’s point, mathematically that’s led to some softening in deal activity.', 'When you dig into that a little bit more, the decrease in deal activity has been across quite a few sectors. The energy sector drove it significantly last year, as you might expect. But even in B2B and B2C deals as well, we saw quite a decrease. And at least for B2C, that’s continued into this year.', 'Bryce Klempner: One other factor here that I would just mention, because often you get the questions of, gosh, there’s been a lot of capital raised—there’s a lot of dry powder out there, is that what’s driving multiples up? Is it because there’s so much more “shadow capital”?', 'Well, yes, in part that’s what it is. But in part, it’s also just the general economy. When PE or PE-style investors go to buy a company, they’re often bidding against other financial investors. But they’re also bidding against “strategics.” And as global stock markets have risen, those strategics are paying with stock that is just worth more. Many of them just have massive cash hoards as well. It’s the combination of these factors that’s pushing multiples up and increasing competition for these deals.', 'Cait Murphy: So, Matt, in a previous interview, you noted that there’s a lot of hand-wringing in the industry about dry powder. Last year, it reached a record of $1.8 trillion, according to McKinsey. Explain the term “dry powder” and what the hand-wringing is about.', 'Matt Portner: Dry powder, in its simplest definition, is capital that has been committed but not called. And so, it is capital on hand that managers have not yet invested. I think the hand-wringing is because in absolute terms, as you noted, that number has increased dramatically over the last few years.', 'What we don’t want to ignore completely is, you can’t just look at it in absolute terms. If you look at it relative to assets under management or fundraising, it’s actually been fairly consistent. And what we’ve talked about is looking at it more as inventory on hand, which is relative to deal activity.', 'And so, dry powder relative to deal activity has been fairly consistent over the last number of years. The one thing to be concerned about is, as we’ve just discussed, deal activity has started to soften in the last couple of years. If that decrease in deal activity continues, and dry powder continues to increase at the rate it is, that could be cause for concern.', 'Bryce Klempner: One note here is that the data is imperfect. A key attribute of private markets is that they are, in fact, private. So, the data that we have is basically data from structures that become public in some way—usually because it’s a blind pool, and a public institution has to report, and hence that comes out into the light.', 'One note on dry powder is that in addition to the $1.7 trillion or $1.8 trillion that’s out there—that, as Matt says, represents a record in absolute terms but in relative terms has been fairly steady—there’s an unknown additional amount of dry powder out there in two different forms of what we call shadow capital. One form is separately managed accounts that general partners have raised but that aren’t being reported publicly in any substantial way because they’re with a single institution at a time. And most of those institutions don’t have public-reporting requirements.', 'The second form of dry powder is capital that limited partners, such as pensions and sovereign wealth funds, have allocated to the PE asset class or to other private market asset classes but which they intend to invest in a form that is not in the kind of comingled vehicle that will become public.', 'So, for instance, when a pension says, “We want to invest some of our capital directly into PE-style transactions or do it as a coinvestment alongside a general partner,” that’s typically not getting picked up in the numbers that are reported on dry powder. To a certain extent, that’s the pointy end of the spear. It’s not most investors that are allocating a lot of their capital this way, but it is increasing. If you look at some of the larger investors that are leaning forward to a greater extent in allocating capital directly or independently into this asset class, half of the capital that they have allocated to PE at this point is, in fact, shadow capital.', 'Cait Murphy: Matt, just going back to what you were saying: on the one hand, you have the record estimate of dry powder, and on the other, a softening of deal numbers. You said, combined, that could be a cause for concern. Can you just expand on that? What’s the worry?', 'Matt Portner: The worry would be that it starts to burn a hole in the external managers’ pockets, and they start doing deals they wouldn’t otherwise want to do, particularly given the valuation environment. So, I think that’s one concern. Our feeling toward that is, yes, it will for some. For the sophisticated managers that continue to rely on their processes and their diligence, it won’t, and they will continue to remain disciplined. But if you see deal activity start to decline, that could be a concern.', 'Bryce Klempner: And on this point, we have seen a greater degree of discipline over the last couple years than we did in the run up to the global financial crisis. Rather than continuing to underwrite or assume increasing multiples, most of the PE managers that we’ve seen are assuming some degree of multiples contraction. They’re assuming that when they sell the company, the multiple that they’re able to receive will be smaller than when they buy the company and that they’re still able to find deals at that level. So, there is greater discipline.', 'Cait Murphy: Bryce, you’ve noted that limited partners are increasingly turning to separately managed accounts, also known as SMAs or strategic partnerships. Why is that the case, and what are the implications?', 'Bryce Klempner: As more capital goes into SMAs, it’s harder for any given observer to understand what’s happening, simply because the data is no longer becoming public.', 'In terms of what it means for the limited partners, the asset owners who are allocating capital, it typically means that they are getting greater discretion, greater transparency, and often paying lower fees in exchange for relationships that are more bespoke.', 'What it means for the general partners is, on the one hand, yes, they’re often receiving lower fees, but it’s often on terms that are preferable for them—longer lockups and access to closer relationships with investors that they’re keen to build long-term partnerships with. Sometimes, as you mentioned, Cait, the most extreme example of the trend toward SMAs is the trend that you mentioned of strategic partnerships, which is still a relatively rare construct that has nevertheless generated quite a bit of interest in the past few years, in particular among large investors who are seeking, in one fell swoop, to find convenient ways of increasing their ability to deploy capital in the private markets in situations where they trust that they won’t do worse than the average.', 'Often in these strategic partnerships, they’re saying, “We want to deploy capital across asset classes. We recognize that in all the asset classes that it goes to, it may not be in top decile vehicles. But we’re very confident that we’re not going to do worse than the average. We recognize that our asset allocation overall, across asset classes, is the major driver of returns. And simply enabling us to move closer to our target asset allocations has tremendous value associated with it.”', 'Matt Portner: And for general partners, there are benefits too. Bryce alluded to some of them before. If you eliminate and reduce some of the friction of fundraising consistently for general partners by having a large strategic partnership where capital is recycled back into the partnership, that is hugely beneficial to general partners. And in some instances where they happen to have a strategic partnership with a prominent pension fund or sovereign wealth fund, that provides them what we’d call an anchor tenant in some of their new vehicles. When they’re going out to fund raise for those vehicles, having a very well-respected limited partner already committed can be very helpful for them.', 'Cait Murphy: Can you talk a little bit about how the PE industry is incorporating digital and analytics?', 'Bryce Klempner: Both limited partners and general partners have recognized that these technological advancements have made major disruptions on the industries that they invest in and have started asking the questions, “How is this going to impact our own industry? How should we be evolving our own institutions to take advantage of it?”', 'You’ve started to see progress everywhere from, at the simplest level, institutions saying, “How can we take elements of our own workflow and make them faster, cheaper, smarter, better? How can we make our diligence faster—for instance, by using optical character recognition or natural language processing to pour through the thousands of documents in a data room faster?”', 'In other examples, it’s revolutionizing the processes. There’s one general partner in Europe that has gained a fair bit of attention for meaningfully shifting its sourcing process to be an artificial-intelligence-driven sourcing process where they take 30 or 35 different kinds of what they call “alternative data,” and they smush them together into a giant database. This black box then spits out companies that seem to fit the characteristics of past companies that they’ve had success investing in.', 'You see quite a spectrum of how institutions are thinking about using this. Most of them are at the very front end of saying, “Can we do this? Should we do this? When should we do this? How will we do this?”', 'Cait Murphy: A lot of what we’ve talked about here is clearly relevant regardless of where you are, whether it be Europe, Asia, or North America. Are there any distinctions between regions in terms of how things are evolving or what the risks are?', 'Bryce Klempner: I’d offer two points of distinction. One is within the developed markets. To paint with a very broad brush, there tends to be a difference in firm personality between the American general partners and the European ones.', 'It’s a difference that I think stems from where these firms came. The American funds tend to be founder driven. They tended to be entrepreneurial start-ups. The European funds, more often, were spinouts of banks. So, they tended to start off with more of an institutional culture, with professional managers. They tended to be less concerned about the notion of succession. They tended to be less centered on one or two people than the American firms. And so, they’ve faced different challenges and opportunities as they scaled. Conversely, the American ones tended to be more entrepreneurial, more centered around one or two or three iconic founders, and that was an opportunity for them in so far as it enabled them historically to make bolder moves to scale faster and so forth. But it also provided some growing pains as that initial generation yielded to their successors.', 'A second dimension is the difference between how this is evolving in the developed markets and in the emerging markets. As important as institutionalization is in the developed markets, it’s even more important in the emerging markets. You’ll often hear limited partners say things along the lines of, “I certainly don’t want to invest in an emerging manager in an emerging market.” If they’re going to allocate capital to developing markets, more often than not they will set a fairly high bar for institutionalization.', 'Matt Portner: To build on that, look at a couple of statistics from Asia, which has been a bit volatile and bumpy over the years in PE. I think one of the signs of the increasing maturation, or the early maturation, of Asian private equity and private markets generally is, deal volume in Asia jumped by 96 percent last year. Granted, these are off smaller bases than we’re talking about in the developed markets. But deal volume jumped significantly, with some huge B2B deals. And fundraising also increased by about 10 percent year on year in Asia.', 'Some specific private markets asset classes, like private debt, have really thrived there recently given the challenges of accessing the debt markets through traditional banks in some Asian countries. So, I think the data is varying out this notion of increasing institutionalization and early maturation.', 'Bryce Klempner: Historically, one way to frame it is that the greatest challenge that limited partners faced in developed-market PE was getting enough capital in. And the greatest challenge they faced in emerging-market private markets was getting any capital out.', 'It was historically quite hard to find firms that had a real track record of successful exits. That’s started to shift. But I think you still see a bit of a bias among limited partners to allocating only to emerging-market managers who’ve really demonstrated an ability to exit as well as deploy capital.', 'Cait Murphy: Thanks very much, Bryce and Matt.

83,Zero-based budgeting revisited: Why this time is different,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/zero-based-budgeting-revisited-why-this-time-is-different,"This budgeting concept allows senior-leadership teams to put their money where their strategy is, aligning resources with business priorities and setting the example from the top.","['This budgeting concept allows senior-leadership teams to put their money where their strategy is, aligning resources with business priorities and setting the example from the top.', 'In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partner Kyle Hawke and senior McKinsey external adviser Jan Perkins speak to Simon London about why zero-based budgeting (ZBB)—an idea that’s nearly 50 years old—is having a bit of a renaissance in companies looking to reset their resource-allocation methods.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Hello, and welcome to this edition of the McKinsey Podcast with me, Simon London. Today, we’re delving into the world of finance and budgeting—specifically, the set of practices known as zero-based budgeting. Now, zero-based budgeting is making something of a comeback. There are a few reasons for this, but probably the biggest is companies are realizing that, when done well, zero-based budgeting can be a very effective way to free up cash for reinvestment.', 'In other words, it can underpin a more dynamic approach to reallocating resources across the company. However, as we’ll hear, zero-based budgeting is not for the faint hearted. To discuss the issues, we’re joined today by Jan Perkins. Jan is a senior adviser to McKinsey and a former senior executive in the consumer sector. We’re also joined by Kyle Hawke, who’s a McKinsey partner based in Washington, DC. Jan and Kyle, thanks so much for joining today.', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002Thanks for having us, Simon.', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002Good to be here.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Zero-based budgeting is definitely one of the more quasi-technical topics that we’ve tackled on this podcast. Kyle, if you don’t mind, maybe start by giving us a quick overview of what zero-based budgeting is.', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002The concept of zero-based budgeting is not a new concept. It was actually introduced in 1970 but is experiencing a bit of a renaissance in recent years. If you go back and you look at the definition of it in 1970, it was purely about the budgeting process and breaking down the budget into small pieces so that management can make decisions on where to invest. But it was purely a budgeting technique.', 'In the last five years, it has experienced a bit of a renaissance because it’s become much more than that. It’s really a new way of working that allows companies to put their money where it matters most, align resources with their business priorities, and do that on a repeatable basis.', 'It’s a process that’s embedded in the normal financial-planning and management routines. It’s a set of systems that, first, give you visibility to where you’re spending money and where your resources are today and allows you to compare that to where they should be [Exhibit 1]. Then it provides better visibility to where you’re spending, so that you can have better dialogues with the management team.', 'It’s a [form of] governance that makes cost management and resource allocation really part of everyone’s job rather than just finance.', '', 'Simon London:\\u2002The obvious follow-up there is why the renaissance? Like you say, as a concept this has been around for quite a long time. What makes it especially relevant today?', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002Resources get stuck where they have always been, and we’ve done a lot of research on this. We studied the resource reallocation of 1,500 companies over a 20-year period, and what we found is that 90 percent of the dollars stay where they were the year before. So only 10 percent was actually reallocated across business units, geographies, or brands.', 'However, some companies are moving dollars more fluidly. If you look at those companies with [a] more dynamic resource reallocation, they actually grow their total returns to shareholders by 10 percent, whereas the more dormant reallocators grow at only 6 percent. What that means, over that same 20-year period, is that the market cap of the more dynamic resource reallocators is actually twice that of the dormant reallocators. It sounds good, right? But the question is how do you unlock that tight grip that managers have over their budgets? We believe a large part of that lies in zero-based budgeting.', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002I would add to the rationale behind the renaissance: companies have years of productivity initiatives trying to unlock those resources. And I believe there’s a portion of companies that became quite successful at zero-based budgeting, making it more than just a cost-reduction or a budgeting exercise and getting some pretty outstanding results. That caught the attention of your external financial analysts, in addition to some of the other competitive companies [Exhibit 2]. People became more excited about what is the magic to zero-based budgeting and can we use it? Will it work for us?', '', 'Simon London:\\u2002And the criticism was that to do this well, you need a level of granularity—where costs fall, who the “owners” are, where the possible efficiencies are, and so on in a more manual finance world. That was a huge level of effort. But in a world where we’ve got very good cloud-based finance systems, a lot of that infrastructure is there to track all this. Is that, broadly, the way to think about it?', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002If you look at some of the criticisms of zero-based budgeting, one of them is that it’s not a repeatable process and is something that you can only do on a periodic basis. What we’ve seen is that digital tools actually facilitate the process end to end and make it easier for companies to make it part of the way that they work rather than this one-time or periodic event.', 'Historically, budgeting from zero is very manually intensive and required thousands of spreadsheets from across the organization, both to build the budget and then to monitor performance at the required level of granularity. But now there are cloud-based solutions that—off the shelf, for the most part—can support the majority of the process and be ingrained in the normal way that you work and replace those thousands of spreadsheets that existed before.', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002And they enable more than just the budgeting. They’re also enabling the ability to govern it, and governance, I think, is a key piece of the sustainability of this sort of initiative.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Just say a little bit more about that, Jan. What do we mean when we talk about governance in this context?', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002Governance is the opportunity to really maintain that level of visibility and ensure that you are spending according to the transformational targets and the policy revisions that have been put in place. [The failure to do] that, I think, would be, in my experience, one of the key faults of some of the prior initiatives. You make the changes. You post them. You communicate them. You put it in the budget, and then over the months, the quarters, and the years to follow, you lose visibility as to whether people are adhering to the policies, and the spending starts to creep back up.', 'The governance, when you’re using the tools to lock into the budgeting, can also connect to other tools that help you report against what you’re spending. Are you adhering to policies? And are there other opportunities to look at?', 'Simon London:\\u2002Can we put some numbers around what’s the upside? And what sort of results have we seen for companies putting in zero-based-budgeting processes and doing it well?', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002So companies have achieved between 10 and 25 percent reductions in aggregate. As you drill down into certain cost categories—and depending on how aggressive and transformational you want to be—you can certainly see 50 to 60 to 75 percent cost reductions in particular cost categories.', 'But these results are pretty immediate. You can see them hit the P&L [profit-and-loss statement] in four to six months. Some of them that are transformational can take longer. It can take a couple of years. And you can see the savings on any type of costs. Overhead, of course, organizational supply-chain manufacturing costs, marketing, distribution, within cost of goods sold, capital expenditures. You can apply this approach to any type of cost category.', 'Most importantly—beyond unlocking these resources, though—a key contributing factor is a new way of working. And it’s going to build a culture of cost management and an ownership mind-set so people are thinking very much along the lines of “why should I spend this dollar?” versus historically saying, “where can I cut?”', 'Simon London:\\u2002You talked at the top, Kyle, about incentives. What’s the role of incentives in this, and what do we mean? Is that giving department managers incentives to really take this seriously and building that into compensation?', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002Every company has a few metrics in the incentive calculations for executives. And there’s always something around growth, and there’s always something around profit. But there’s rarely something around cost as an explicit metric. The assumption is that if we have growth and we have profits, then cost is in the middle of those two, and it takes care of itself. In zero-based budgeting, the mind-set or the approach is that cost is the one thing that managers have complete control over—especially fixed costs. And therefore we should incentivize managers, or measure the performance of managers, based on that as an explicit metric rather than an implicit metric by measuring the other two.', 'The clarity of ‘what we report and what we measure, we deliver’ is an aspect of accountability that you cannot do this without.', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002Kyle, your comments on the operating profit are exactly right. Most P&L owners would say, “If I hit my operating-profit target, clearly I have met my cost targets also in overhead costs.” To hold us accountable to how much we’re spending, and the assessment of “is this dollar spend necessary,” you need to have cost built in as a separate metric.', 'The incentives can be tied to the operating profit or to the annual bonus. There are several ways to do it. But the clarity of “what we report and what we measure, we deliver” is a message and an aspect of accountability that you cannot do this without.', 'Simon London:\\u2002What are the other success factors, do you think, Kyle? When you look at the key things you have to get right here to do this well, what would you pick out?', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002I can think of five success factors. One is that you need to align the approach to the organization’s culture and objectives. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and there are many dimensions on how to customize it. For example, the level of focus that you have on reinvestment versus target setting or the degree of granularity in the budgeting are all choices that a company can make to make it fit for purpose.', 'A second success factor would be to have an intelligent approach to target setting. Not every dollar is created equal, and there are areas that you want to protect and invest in, which are aligned with the value drivers of the business. There are others that you want to eliminate completely or cut to the bone. And you need to be able to distinguish good dollars from bad dollars, or productive costs from unproductive costs, so that you can address them intelligently.', 'The third would be to have an equal focus on where to invest as there is on where to reduce. If you overemphasize the cost-reduction or the target-setting aspect, you have the risk of losing the organization along the way and having them believe that you’ve gone too far and you’ve swung the pendulum and you’ve forgotten about growth.', 'You need to have a serious and visible commitment from top management as you’re embedding the new ways of working.', 'But if you can engage the organization in identifying where to reinvest those dollars, it’s an incredibly inspiring moment for them to say, “That was hard, but it was worth it because we are able to do these things that we weren’t able to do before.” A fourth would be to focus on changing the mind-sets and behaviors in the frontline operators and not making it just a financial exercise or a productivity initiative. And then, finally, you need to have a serious and visible commitment from top management, especially during the activation phase as you’re embedding the new ways of working.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Say a little bit more about senior-leadership commitment. It’s something that we hear is necessary, of course, in any big transformational change. But for zero-based budgeting, what does it mean in practice?', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002My experience was that the leadership commitment and role modeling were a critical success factor. You lead by example. Where that became very visible and impactful to the organization to start the cultural shift and the realization that things would be different, there would be a new way of working—it begins in the target-setting. Having a leadership team that’s committed to being decisive and aligned on where you’re going. Transformational on where they want to see things differently. Being committed to the idea that if it’s one policy, it fits and applies to all of us. So that’s walking the walk or leading by example.', 'We didn’t write policies where you had the haves and the have-nots—if you were this level or above, you could still retain this benefit or this service, and if you’re this level and below, you could not. If we really are going to be serious about the idea that every dollar matters, it matters no matter what level you’re at in the organization. It could be something as simple as the commitment, as with [one company’s] ZBB initiative, to use fewer printers and go paperless as much as possible. I would see executives come into the meetings and say, “Make sure you bring your laptop or put a projector in the room because we’re not printing out copies.” And as soon as you had an executive once or twice say, “No, thank you, I don’t want that copy,” it didn’t take long at all before everybody got that message. Just small examples like those would contribute to showing that we’re serious in a new way of working. And it’s going to take some of the monies we used to spend and redirect them or allow us to redirect them and grow the business.', 'Communication also was critical. Leaders needed to continually communicate to employees, talking to them along the way. “Here’s what we’re looking at. Here’s what we’re changing. Here’s what it means.” Having the leadership be seen as the ones committed to that and sharing the message. People would hear that message being shared by the leadership and say, “Wow, they are serious about this, and this is going to be a new way of working. If they’re going to adhere to the policy, I guess I shouldn’t ask for an exception to the policy.”', 'That was not an easy thing for them to swallow and say, “Yeah, OK, we’re going to give up all of these benefits also because we’re on the team.” If there was a particular cost category that we were going after really aggressively, there was the ability to say, “Let’s collect data. Let’s stay fact based. Let’s accumulate information on whether we think this is inhibiting us to be successful. So if after nine months, 12 months, this policy is punitive or it’s not supportive of where we’re going, let’s agree that we can change it.” Once we did that, you had more leaders saying, “OK, I can get on board with that. Let’s try it. Let’s do it. Let’s collect the data.”', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002It sounds like there was a willingness to test and learn that may not have existed in other programs.', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002Yes, and to be fact based about it. It wasn’t hearsay and sound bites; the willingness to do it was based on “collect the data. Let’s see the real facts. And then let’s continue to be decisive moving forward.” That was a significant cultural shift and very eye opening, on several cost categories, to get us to where we needed to be.', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002Are there other ways that leaders can role-model—just in terms of the questions that they ask, for example?', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002Part of the success of the total zero-based-budgeting transformation is to help them be strong leaders so that they can learn how to approach things differently and then teach their teams and their managers how to approach things differently. How do you handle all these constant confrontations and conflicts in negotiations? When you go about assessing a cost category or looking at it, what are the right questions to ask? How do you assess whether this spend is necessary? What do I do with a very strong-willed manager who says, you know, “Life will end if we can’t have this spend”?', 'And sometimes just giving the managers the words, or even the sales reps. “How do I talk to my clients and my customers now when I have this new meal allowance I have to adhere to?” You can say to them, “Let’s role-play a little” and talk about how do you explain to them that “this is where the company’s going. And here’s why. It’s because we will now have this money to invest in these things that will grow both our businesses.” Openness and willingness to have those dialogues were huge learning opportunities and gave us the foundation to build on to shift the culture.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Something I read about in the literature is around having dual cost ownership or dual category ownership. I think that’s a really interesting idea. So, Jan, what does that mean in practice? And how does it help?', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002The dual ownership of cost categories is extremely interesting, and it’s hard, initially, to get your head around how that’s going to work. As you talk to the leadership that owns a P&L, not only are you now, from a ZBB standpoint, analyzing all of the dollars being spent, you’re also introducing another layer of governance looking over leaders’ shoulders, making sure that they are adhering to the targets and the spend.', 'My experience was that dual ownership was met with some resistance initially, and it didn’t work as well as we had hoped. Trying to understand the culture of the company and where the leadership was in the acceptance and acknowledgment of it, we stepped back and redesigned it. The leadership team needed to step right in and be the ones who did the cross-category ownership.', 'You would have a president of a business unit who had a complete P&L that they were accountable for but also oversaw the spending in a certain category. Inventory write-off is a cost category and something that, transformationally, you were looking to make some significant headway in the processes to, over time, reduce it dramatically.', 'That particular business-unit president would oversee that across the organization. They would have conversations with other business-unit owners, other supply-chain leaders, and anybody who was contributing to that overall spend as to how they were progressing, why they were off target, what things were being done to address getting back on target, and what help they might need to get there. Once we got to the point where the leaders were the ones accountable for help in overseeing, by cost category, it was much more impactful. Plus, they knew they had the resources under them to support that from a visibility and a governance standpoint.', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002I talked earlier about this idea of adapting the approach to the company’s culture and objectives. One of the ways to adapt the approach is to design this cost category on a role to be fit for purpose. So there’s a spectrum of ownership that we see with our clients that can vary over time, and it can also vary by area of the business or cost category.', 'On the far left, you have this individual playing the role of a coach. And on the far right, you have this individual playing the role of a co-owner. A coach is there to inform or guide and help share best practices. A co-owner is designed to do all that but also to have joint accountability for, and a say in, the spend decisions in that area.', 'Simon London:\\u2002This whole part of the conversation has brought home to me again that zero-based budgeting is not for the faint hearted. It does involve quite significant changes in the way that people work, including the executive team. So, Kyle, you must talk to a lot of companies about zero-based budgeting. How do you know, and how do they know, that they’re ready to commit to something like this?', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002So I definitely talk to a lot of clients on this topic. And I would say that, for every client I have the opportunity to serve, there are probably ten where we have the conversation and we explore it, and then we mutually agree that a ZBB approach is not for them. And this can be for many reasons, but oftentimes it is because there is just not the leadership commitment at the moment to drive it. That’s OK because there are other approaches that you can take that are probably more fit for purpose, and they don’t need to go all-in to really focus on changing the ways of working.', 'You have to engage not just the senior leadership but also these influencers who are not necessarily at the top levels of the organization.', 'Simon London:\\u2002For the one in ten where you do decide jointly to move forward with a commitment to zero-based budgeting, what can you do? And what can the executives do themselves to get ready to get this off the ground successfully?', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002The first is to help senior leaders write their own personal change stories. This is their own interpretation or words of why the company is embarking on this journey and what it means for them personally. They can then use this change story to communicate and cascade with their team in a much more personal way rather than taking a script that somebody else gave to them.', 'The second is identifying other influencers across the organization. So you have to engage not just the senior leadership but also these influencers who are not necessarily at the top levels of the organization.', 'The third thing is something we’ve talked quite a bit about today, which is helping leaders         role-model the new, very visible behaviors. Whether that’s dropping the gold-plated IT service desk that was previously exclusive to the leadership team or just simply asking the right questions to the organization around what would it take to get there, it’s helping them role-model those behaviors because we have seen that to be so critical.', 'Then, fourth would be cocreating the answer with employees rather than simply handing it down as a mandate. And this is incredibly important to drive conviction in the targets and that, yes, there is a way to get there. So that when you go start to build up from zero, you actually have a path on how you’re going to achieve it rather than a bunch of plugs in the budget that you need to figure out throughout the year.', 'Simon London:\\u2002Anything you would add to that list, Jan?', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002The other piece, once you do agree to go into this journey—and as Kyle mentioned, giving each senior leader a personal message—is incorporating in that a knowledge and a foundation on where the organization has been. There’s no organization out there that hasn’t already been through some productivity initiative and isn’t going to be skeptical coming into this right off the bat.', 'So helping them relate to that, why would this initiative be different? Also, taking into consideration the company’s culture and what is it that’s going to help make this successful? And how you can get them to that point of being fact based and addressing some of the emotional reactions are really key.', 'Simon London:\\u2002So I think that’s all we have time for today. But, Kyle and Jan, thank you so much. That was really interesting.', 'Jan Perkins:\\u2002Absolutely. Thank you for the opportunity.', 'Kyle Hawke:\\u2002Thanks, Simon.', 'Simon London:\\u2002And thanks to you, our listeners, for tuning in.

Whatever business you’re in, like it or not, you’re in the data-privacy business. The data you collect on customers, employees, prospects, even visitors to your buildings or your websites is increasingly subject to rules and regulations. The new European data-protection directive, GDPR, is part of the story but it’s not the whole story by any means. Joining me today to discuss the issues are two McKinsey consultants who spend their time working with clients on exactly these issues related to data, analytics, technology, privacy, and risk. They are Kayvaun Rowshankish, who is a partner based in New York, and Alexis Trittipo, an associate partner, also based in New York. Kayvaun and Alexis, thanks very much for joining.', 'Alexis Trittipo: Absolutely. Excited to join you.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: Pleasure to be here.', 'Simon London: Data privacy: It feels like it’s becoming a general management topic. Data in general, but data privacy as part of that. This definitely feels like something that, if you are a general manager, certainly in marketing, in sales and technology, but probably a whole bunch of other areas too, you have to know about this.', 'Alexis Trittipo: As we look at organizations, across industries, personal data is managed at all levels of the organization. It’s not just a problem for the chief data officer or the chief information security office anymore.', 'This is a problem for HR. It’s a problem for your customer-service representatives. It really spans the organization in terms of who touches personal data and who will need to, quite honestly, understand the regulations that are coming around.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: Every institution is heading in a direction where they are data-centric institutions. If you just take Amazon as an example. Sure, they stick physical products in the mail. But 90 percent of running their business is around data and data of individuals and data that represent the products that they manage. That’s true of most sectors now. The other thing that’s raising this to the management level is the fact that the scope of PII [personally identifiable information] is quite ambiguous. We might have thought of it previously as just a customer’s name, maybe their social security number, other information about their whereabouts.', 'But now, because there’s so much sort of behavioral data that’s being captured, there are transactions and so on that are being captured, and multiple ways using advanced analytics to derive that information, it’s just become a much more complex and opaque space.', 'Simon London: One of the big talking points at the moment is that the European data-protection regulation, GDPR, went into effect at the end of May. I suspect that a lot of managers are only now getting to grips with the operational implications of that. There are probably a lot of institutions, frankly, still scrambling to get compliant. So, Kayvaun, could you give us a quick overview of the contours of GDPR?', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: In simple terms, the directive aims to protect individuals. And by “individuals,” the focus is European individuals. But that doesn’t mean the institutions out of Europe are exempt from this. European individuals travel, they have relationships with institutions outside of Europe, and there are third-party relationships with institutions that handle European individuals’ data that then bring the next layer of institutions into scope as well. There’s a pretty broad set of firms that are affected.', 'What the directive aims to do, again, in fairly simple terms, is it forces these institutions to put structure and discipline around what PII, personally identifiable information, actually is, where it is, put more choice in the hands of the individuals who the PII relates to, so that they can decide if they even want you to have it, or how to manage it (see sidebar, “The GDPR: Key facts”).', 'The scope of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is broad, covering personal information that can be linked to an identifiable individual (such as national identification number, employee authentication, payment-transaction history, and date of birth) in any format (structured or unstructured) and in any medium (online, offline, or backup storage).', 'The regulation is designed to protect the privacy of EU residents by introducing stringent consent requirements, data-subject rights, and obligations on organizations that gather, control, and process data. Its core requirements cover the following:', 'Record of activities. Organizations should maintain a record of data-processing activities and be ready to present it to the regulator at any time.', 'Legal basis for data. All data processing should have a legal basis, such as the consent of the data subject or the need to fulfill a regulatory or legitimate business purpose.', 'Rights of data subjects. Data subjects are imbued with rights that organizations must honor such as the right to be forgotten (or, more accurately, to data erasure), the right to data portability, the right to object, the right to revoke consent, and the right to restrict processing.', 'Security. Organizations should protect data through a set of controls, such as encryption or “pseudonymization,” and have effective operational procedures and policies for handling data safely.', 'Third-party management. Vendors and suppliers, including outsourcing partners, should be required to protect personal data and should be monitored to ensure that they do so.', 'Privacy by design. Data protection should be included in the business-as-usual processes such as with any organization planning a new technology, product, or service from the beginning of the development process.', 'Breach notification. Data breaches likely to result in high risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms should be reported to the authorities within 72 hours and subsequently to the data subjects as well in certain cases.', 'The new regulation is enforced via national supervisory authorities within the European Union that are granted wide-ranging enforcement powers and sanctions, such as the power to ban data processing. The fines for failure to comply are high, as much as 4 percent of annual worldwide revenues. The GDPR also allows individuals to seek civil actions (including class-action lawsuits) against organizations that violate their data-protection rights.', 'While GDPR is the most expansive regulation of its kind to date, there has also been movement in other geographies to increase protections around personal data. In the United States, for example, the state of California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which holds organizations to similar standards and imbues data subjects with similar rights.', 'It forces those institutions to minimize how much of that data they actually store [and process], puts controls around the PII that they store and process, and then enforces a set of governance and processes around that data, which includes accountability models like putting a privacy officer in place as well as a set of processes to interact with regulators and individuals either in terms of managing their rights or responding to breaches and other types of events in this space.', 'Then lastly, the other thing that this regulation does is it puts in place some fairly severe penalties if you get it wrong. Quite explicitly, there’s a penalty of up to 4 percent of global revenues, so you can be fined anything up to 4 percent of global revenues if you get this wrong. But it also puts in place, because this is going to become a legal requirement, the opportunity for individuals to take civil action against those institutions if they get it wrong.', 'Alexis Trittipo: GDPR is the first large-scale regulation of this size that’s really aimed at protecting individual rights around personal data. The control that it aims to give individuals over their data in things like, I can have it deleted, I can ask to see what a company has on me, at this scale, is unprecedented. It’s a very interesting test case to see how corporations will react. We’ll see over time, both how this plays out in Europe, but also how this plays out globally.', 'Simon London: Is it right to say that even though GDPR is from Europe, certainly for any large global organization, it becomes the de facto global standard?', 'Alexis Trittipo: It’s hard to say global standard because what we’re seeing right now as folks are looking to implement it is they’re largely implementing it for their European-based operations and where they touch EU-based customers and clients.', 'But most organizations are thinking about, “If I have to have this level of controls, this level of protection, this level of processes around personal data for Europe, how do I think about that more broadly? And how do I expand that?” And I don’t think organizations are there yet. But as we think about it, this will be, globally, the highest standard around controlling and keeping personal data safe.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: There’s a fair bit of noise around this issue as to whether the US should adopt consistent standards and just implement them across the US or if the needs of the US market are sufficiently different that they come up with something different. I think the same is probably true of other regions.', 'We do expect that there will be other regulations emerging covering regions that GDPR doesn’t cover today that aims to address similar issues. If you look at history and regulations, things that came out of Europe first, the US chose to do something different.', 'If the same thing happens here, it’s going to cause all kinds of problems. Because the systems that global institutions use for managing data of European individuals are the same systems they use for managing US individuals’ information. If you have to start applying different standards and controls to those systems and processes, it’s just going to cause a lot of fragmentation and redundancy and inefficiency, potentially leakage, and distraction of mind share because you’ve got too many different standards to deal with trying to address the same thing.', 'I do think that it would be ideal if there was some consistency and this became somewhat of a default that others tried to embrace and stretch out to other regions. But, as I say, if the past is anything to go by, it does give me pause that that would happen.', 'Simon London: One of the things that I read about GDPR is that it is principles based [exhibit]. Looking at a couple of principles laid out, these are pretty broad. I wonder, could you just give us a couple of examples of what it really requires of companies?', 'Alexis Trittipo: As you think about a principles-based regulation like GDPR, it leaves a lot open to interpretation. The principles are quite high-level. Each individual company will have to figure out how they’re interpreting that, what the scope is, and what that means for them. And we’ll see over time as regulators react to that.', 'One is around storage limitation. This is a principle that says basically, “Don’t keep data longer than you need it for an active reason that you’ve told the data subject.” And when I say “data subject,” it could be a customer, an employee, it’s a person like you or me.', 'This is contrary to the ways companies manage data today. Typically, I think, “Oh, I want to collect the data. I’m going to keep it for as long as I want. I’m going to use it in a bunch of different analyses.” I don’t think about, unless there’s a regulatory reason, deleting that data. I just keep it in my central data warehouse, or, more likely, in various warehouses.', '', 'Companies are really going to have to keep track of how long they’ve had data and actively go about a process of data deletion. One of the things that’s very challenging is how do I reconcile where I have to keep something for a legal reason, or for a tax reason, or a compliance reason, and where I need to delete it for this principle of limiting the length of time of data storage. That’s something that companies are going to have to grapple with.', 'Another example is limitation around the purpose. The regulation requires you to tell the data subject why you’re collecting the data. And it has to be collected for a specified, legitimate purpose. Then once you’ve used it for that legitimate purpose, you can’t really use it for anything else, according to the regulation. So if I’ve said, “Hey, I’m collecting this information so I can open a bank account for you,” for example, I can’t then use that information to do marketing or other things. As companies think about this, the types of disclosures they have to make to data subjects will become important so that they can use the data for business purposes that they’ll need it for.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: The other thing that I think most institutions are grappling with is just defining scope. Just simply the starting point of, “OK, who are covered individuals? And how do I define what is PII related to those individuals?”', 'So, sure, customers are covered. Employees are covered. But as you get into sort of visitors to buildings where you have to enter some information to get access to the building, they may be leaving PII behind. You have noncustomers that are making inquiries. At what point do they actually become your responsibility to protect information that they’re entering in your website, for example?', 'And what is PII? There’s obviously name, address, social security number. But as you get into things like IP address or clickstream information, it’s not clear that that would be covered necessarily, and it would be extremely hard to put the types of controls around this stuff that the regulation’s asking for.', 'Simon London: Although GDPR is a very principles-based, there are some very specific rights, aren’t there? If you’re an EU resident, you get granted some very specific rights under GDPR. Can you just talk a little bit about those?', 'Alexis Trittipo: That’s right. And, again, when we think about the purpose of this regulation, a lot of it is to give folks more control over their personal data. And so those rights are things like the right to access. An EU resident would have the right to call up a company and say, “I want to see all of the personal data you have on me.”', 'Another one is, the right to erasure, also called the right to be forgotten, which I can call up a company and say, “I want you to delete all the personal data you have on me.” There’s things like the right to portability. I can ask for my data to be transmitted to someone else.', 'There’s the right to not be processed in a fully automated fashion, which says, “I want a person involved in the decision making on me. I don’t want to have decisions made on me based on analytics or based on machines or based on robots.”', 'All of those rights are very core to GDPR. As companies think through how to comply, being able to ensure that they can meet each of these data-subject rights, within the allotted time frame, which for many of them is 30 days to get back to the data subject, will be quite important.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: The other approach which is likely is that they will just determine some cost benefit of even having that person as a customer. And for many of those that say, “No, I don’t agree to you automating decisions around me. I don’t agree to you storing this type of information about me,” then many institutions will just say, “Fine. I’m sorry, I can’t have you as a customer.”', 'In order to get GDPR right, in order to get privacy right, you need the entire organization to be moving in the same direction.', 'Simon London: You mentioned the requirement [for certain companies] to appoint a chief data-protection officer as part of the new regulation. What is work the data-protection officers do? It sounds like quite a pivotal role in actually coming to answer a lot of these open questions.', 'Alexis Trittipo: The data-protection officer, or DPO, is the hub of the wheel when it comes to GDPR compliance, and they should be very much central when it comes to data privacy overall to help facilitate when data subjects come and say, “I want to exercise one of my rights.” To help facilitate when there’s a data breach and making sure that there’s the right notifications to regulators. To really ensure that there’s consistency of data standards in the policies and the procedures. This person is the accountable party for GDPR.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: What’s quite interesting about this role and has become quite a thorny issue is that the DPO is responsible to the agencies and the authorities, not to the institution that they’re employed by. Plus, there’s language in the regulations that say that they need to have very senior reporting lines, whether to the CEO or the board.', 'What it actually means, and I think what most are interpreting it to mean, is that they need access too. And to Alexis’s point, they are accountable. But in very legal terms. If there is a breach and there is a penalty and someone’s going to get in trouble, it’s the DPO typically that is most legally accountable first and foremost.', 'So it has created a lot of problems in the industry around figuring out where to put this individual in the organization, what responsibilities to appoint to them, where geographically they should sit, especially for non-European institutions that have a global presence. Should they be in the US? Or would it be more relevant for them to sit in a European legal entity, which might actually put them further away from the board? There’s all these kinds of complications.', 'Alexis Trittipo: We see it in different levels of the organization. Sometimes it’s tucked under a CISO, a chief information security officer. Sometimes this person on peer with the C-suite, or C-minus one.', 'As companies think about it, they’ve taken different paths. And, again, this is one of those things where, over time, we’ll see what works better and what doesn’t. And I think we’ll see some shifts to a more standardized way of people treating DPOs similarly.', 'The other thing that’s important to think through is it’s not just the DPO, the individual themselves, that drives this. In order to get GDPR right, in order to get privacy right, you need the entire organization to be moving in the same direction.', 'It’s the DPO and the privacy team, but it’s also legal, it’s also your entire data organization. Those individuals, and having the right team, that’s a collaborative team across the organization, to deal with this is the most important. It can’t be one individual alone.', 'We’re seeing all kinds of capabilities of AI that can help here, whether it’s, for example, around identifying PII and preparing it and cleansing it through an entity resolution.', 'Simon London: This comes at a time when institutions of all stripes are pushing very hard to collect and process data, to take advantage of machine learning, artificial-intelligence [AI] technologies. There’s a lot of activity going on just to be sort of running in the opposite direction, certainly to GDPR. It feels like quite bad news for companies and their efforts to really take advantage of data and find competitive advantage within data.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: That’s absolutely right, certainly as we talk to data-science communities that have enjoyed the pleasure of pulling in mounds of data into big data environments to just explore. You’re seeing them being particularly nervous about the constraints that are likely to impact their, let’s say, creativity. They’re going to have to put more control around the AI models that they’re developing.', 'Alexis Trittipo: The easiest way to get around GDPR, if you still want to use the data, is anonymize and mask. If data is masked and anonymized, you can use that. You can use that and not have to have the purpose told to the data subject ahead of time.', 'Thinking about, “Where do I actually need to know who the individual is?” versus “Where do I just need to have anonymized data that I can use for my analyses?” That will be key in the shortcut to getting this right.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: Ironically here, if you take the kind of counterview of not how is GDPR blocking AI, you can look at how AI is actually enabling GDPR. There’s plenty of opportunities for the two disciplines to come together in that direction. We’re seeing all kinds of capabilities of AI that can help here, whether it’s, for example, around identifying PII and preparing it and cleansing it through entity resolution and other types of capabilities that come out of AI, through auto cleansing or deletion or masking of PII.', 'The concept there is that you have various different interactions with clients that are now moving from, say, human sales teams or human call centers to being AI-driven interfaces like chat bots or automated call centers where, frankly, you’re not in control of what customers are telling you. You may be capturing PII inadvertently because customers are just sharing, so the other factor that comes into place here is whether you can use AI to detect when they’re sharing PII, and either mask it immediately or delete it, or find some other way of blocking it so that you’re not putting the firm at compliance risk.', 'Simon London: I just want to push on this point around big data and machine learning. To a layperson, it almost sounds like creating a data lake by combining information about your customers from multiple sources and then running algorithms on that data with the intention of extending different offers to different customers. So Simon would get one type of offer, Alexis would get a different type of offer. It sounds to me like that could be a breach of GDPR.', 'Alexis Trittipo: I think you go back to the reason you collected data. You have to be explicit about why you’re collecting data. As long as it’s a legitimate business purpose. A legitimate business purpose can be providing the best and most appropriate products to our customers.', 'So if you’ve collected that data with the customer or the client understanding that, then I think that kind of analysis is allowed. Going back to what am I consenting to, as a data subject when you collect my data, and making those disclosures very clear that they’re going to be used for the purposes of understanding and marketing products.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: If you just look at the extent you use a lot of these online applications, so many of them have been putting up these pop-ups as you access the site asking for your consent. I’m sure most people aren’t actually reading much of that; they’re just clicking, “OK.” It’s basically that that you’re consenting to, that you can actually use that information to better tailor the sales process.', 'I do think there needs to be a phase two and a phase three where you go into the backups and the paper files and actually fully extract that person.', 'Simon London: Which strikes me as being fine for data that’s collected now or recently. The question is, is everything that’s going into your data lake, was it collected under those types of conditions? Or is it historic data where the permissions in place at that time were not compliant with GDPR? You were not as explicit as maybe you could have been or should have been around the potential uses of the data.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: This is an interesting point because these consents that are being asked for, as I was describing, if they’re written correctly, they would cover data that you’ve captured in the past. You may have them in backup, you may be using them for a variety of different purposes. And as you’re asking individuals for consent to use their PII, most institutions are creating that consent statement in pretty broad terms. The issue is, what if they say no? And they actually say, “No, we don’t want you to store PII, we want you to delete everything that you’ve got about us.” I don’t think I’ve met a single institution that has really figured out how to deal with that.', 'They’re dealing with it through drawing false boundaries, let’s say, around, “OK, anything that’s in a live system, we will find a way of deleting that data about them. But if it’s in backup, if it’s on paper, then it’s not as easily discoverable anyway, so we’re not going to tackle that.”', 'It’s not completely clear that that is in compliance with how the regulators are thinking about it. It’s still a bit of an ambiguous space.', 'Alexis Trittipo: And I think what we’re seeing across industries, is, to your point, Kayvaun, this will have to be a phased process. Most companies say, “In our live systems, yes. We can delete all your information.” I do think there needs to be a phase two and a phase three where you go into the backups and you go into the paper files and actually fully extract that person. It’ll be interesting to see how organizations take that compliance from the more immediate “in my active systems today” across to the paper files from 20 years ago as well.', 'Kayvaun Rowshankish: And it’s interesting, at the same time, there’s a whole lot of digitization using OCR, optical character recognition, natural language processing, to extract the data that you want from PDFs and physical documents that it won’t be long before you probably shouldn’t be storing paper copies of things anyway.', 'Storage is getting so cheap that even the backups should be fairly accessible that if you wanted to perform against this rights to erasure, then it should be much easier than it is today in the coming years.', 'Simon London: So I think that’s all we have time for today.
